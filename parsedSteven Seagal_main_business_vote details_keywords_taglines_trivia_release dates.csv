He recognizes that he does not know the limitations of his plane, and asks for the Pilot Operating Handbook.

He almost stalled the plane by slowing down without extending the flaps, but he worked it out, as a competent person would, and he figured out the next alarm quickly about the landing gear. Finally, when faced with an obviously too-high approach, he realized that he did not have the expertise to turn around, as the flight attendant suggested, but he got his bearings and located the small field, at which he was taking lessons, and set the plane down there, even though he ended up off the end of the runway.

The script was sold to Savoy Pictures for one million dollars, and they were working on turning it into a film starring Sylvester Stallone, but they disagreed with his twenty million dollar contract to star in the film, so the entire project was cancelled and once Savoy Pictures went bankrupt, the script was never picked up again.', u'Shortly after the Missouri is taken, an F/A-18 approaches the ship.
