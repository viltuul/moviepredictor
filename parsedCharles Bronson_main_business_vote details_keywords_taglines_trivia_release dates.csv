Lee Thompson with star actor Charles Bronson. The two first collaborated on St. Ives (1976), The White Buffalo (1977), Cabo Blanco (1980), 10 to Midnight (1983), Pirullinen kosto (1984) and Murphy's Law (1986). After this movie, they made Messenger of Death (1988) and Kinjite: Forbidden Subjects (1989)."", u'The Cannon Group, Inc., wanted a more muscular-sounding score for the action scenes and decided to re-use much of the music from its past action efforts Missing in Action (1984) and Invasion U.S.A. (1985).', u'Some of the music cues from 10 to Midnight (1983), another Cannon picture, are used in this film.', u'Media Home Entertainment released the film on video in April 1988, having agreed with Cannon to a $2-million advance. Over 100,000 cassettes were sold to rental stores. It was the best-selling entry of the series in the video market.', u'Michael Winner, director of the first three films, showed no interest in directing this one because he had heard that Charles Bronson had a terrible experience filming Death Wish 3 (1985). He was also preoccupied with filming Appointment with Death (1988).', u'Gail Morgan Hickman re-wrote the entire script while filming. Charles Bronson constantly had problems with the dialogue and he requested further rewrites of certain items of dialogue and action scenes. Hickman recalled going through several rewrites on a daily basis.', u'This movie utilizes a storyline similar to that used in the classic Akira Kurosawa film Yojimbo (1961). \'RetroJunk\' writes that Charles Bronson as Paul Kersey ""methodically eliminates gang members, first from one side and then the other, until one gang\'s paranoia about the other gang causes the two competitors to engage in a major confrontation that impacts both groups.""', u'Kay Lenz is only 13 years older than Dana Barron, who plays her daughter.', u""Charles Bronson's salary was $4 million--almost more than the film's budget."", u'Gail Morgan Hickman wrote three different script for the film. The first featured Paul Kersey struggling with a crisis of conscience and trying to reconnect with Geri Nichols from Death Wish II (1982). It was rejected because Jill Ireland faced her own struggle with breast cancer and was unwilling to reprise her role. The second had Kersey going after an international terrorist, and was rejected due to another upcoming film, Wanted: Dead or Alive (1987). The final script had the premise of Kersey playing two gangs against each other. Hickman was influenced by the use of this premise in Yojimbo (1961) and A Fistful of Dollars (1964).', u'The video store where Kersey confronts some of the goons shows numerous posters and displays promoting such other Cannon releases as Field of Honor (1986), The Naked Face (1984), and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 (1986). A movie theatre in the film shows a curious pairing: Otello (1986) and Runaway Train (1985).', u'The second Death Wish (1974) movie to include a Star Trek (1966) actor. Death Wish 3 (1985) had Marina Sirtis, this film has Tim Russ.', u'Though Charles Bronson and J. Lee Thompson worked together nine times, this sequel was the only ""Death Wish"" movie that they made together.', u'The release of this movie represented the shortest window between ""Death Wish"" sequels. It was only two years after Death Wish 3 (1985), whereas the third picture followed three years after Death Wish II (1982) which had followed the original Death Wish (1974) by eight years. Death Wish V: The Face of Death (1994) was not made for another seven years.', u""An earlier draft had Paul living in Los Angeles with a new girlfriend. She was subsequently murdered by crooks. Paul, fighting the urge to return to his vigilante ways, captures the crooks and hands them over to the police, but when the crooks walk on a technicality, Paul becomes the vigilante once more, and hunts them down. One by one. Cannon felt this take on the series was too cerebral and didn't feature enough action. Ultimately, a more conventional storyline was chosen."", u'The highest selling ""Death Wish"" title on the home entertainment market in the U.S. The film easily eclipsed all the other titles when it was released in 1988.', u""Gail Morgan Hickman had previously contributed rejected scripts for Death Wish 3 (1985) and the script of another Charles Bronson film, Murphy's Law (1986)."", u""Gail Morgan Hickman toyed with the idea of giving Kersey a surrogate son called Eric, to avoid repetition in having the character lose another daughter. He changed his mind and turned Eric to Erica, because he felt that the death of a girl would be a stronger echo to the original loss in Kersey's life. Hickman was also the father of a daughter and could better understand the trauma of losing a girl."", u'Gail Morgan Hickman understood that Cannon producers Menahem Golan and Yoram Globus ""wanted a mindless movie with nonstop action"", so he came up with ""cartoonish"" action scenes.', u'The previous three films of the series featured youthful street punks as villains. The fourth film covered new ground featuring adult representatives of organized crime.', u'Charles Bronson was about 66 years old when he appeared in this movie.', u'First ""Death Wish"" movie to have a subtitle as part of its title. The next and final sequel also had one: Death Wish V: The Face of Death (1994). An intended but unfilmed sixth movie was also to have a subtitle: ""Death Wish 6: The New Vigilante"". The first three movies did not have a title subtitle.', u'Some music in the film was taken from Missing in Action (1984) and Invasion U.S.A. (1985).', u'The Cannon Group, Inc. announced the film in 1986, estimating that it would be ready for release by spring 1987. However, the company was by this point facing financial problems. Its greatest box office hit was still Missing in Action (1984) with $38 million domestic gross. Cannon had lost money on box-office flops such as Merirosvot (1986). Consequently, it tightened the budgets of upcoming films to under $5 million per film.', u""For this film, Cannon reached an agreement with independent producer Pancho Kohner, son of Paul Kohner. The senior Kohner was the agent of Charles Bronson. Pancho himself had produced (or co-produced) seven previous Bronson films, including St. Ives (1976), The White Buffalo (1977), Love and Bullets (1979), 10 to Midnight (1983), Pirullinen kosto (1984), Murphy's Law (1986), and Assassination (1987)."", u'Principal photography was originally scheduled to begin on 5 January 1987. However, the start was delayed to March 1987. Filming did not begin in March, either. The delay was due to a stipulation in a line-of-credit agreement that prohibited The Cannon Group, Inc. from having more than two movies in principal photography at the same time. Warner Communications Inc. had guaranteed a $25-million line of credit for the financially troubled Cannon Group, Inc. in December 1986.', u'Death Hunt (1981) and Messenger of Death (1988) are the only movies starring Charles Bronson outside his five film ""Death Wish"" films to have the word ""Death"" in the title. However, Bronson did star in the television episode The Untouchables: The Death Tree (1962)].', u'According to a printout read by a policeman, Kersey lives at 8200 Wilshire Boulevard in west Los Angeles, yet when he returns home (before he is collected in White\'s limo) he drives into the garage of a house with ""351"" painted on the curb.', u'Third and final ""Death Wish"" movie made during the 1980s. The others were Death Wish II (1982) and Death Wish 3 (1985).', u'This was Charles Bronson\'s fifth picture to feature the word ""Death"" in the title. Death Hunt (1981) and Messenger of Death (1988) were others. Bronson made seven movies with this word in the title, five of them being in the \'Death Wish\' series. The final time would be in Death Wish V: The Face of Death (1994), where the word appeared twice.', u'The only ""Death Wish"" sequel in which Paul Kersey does not revert to vigilantism due to an act of violence against a loved one. Erica (Kersey\'s girlfriend\'s daughter whose death motivates him to renew his sudden justice) died of a cocaine overdose taken completely willingly. Technically, she did not get murdered and certainly did not get raped.', u'John P.

But the security for \'the Doctor\' couldn\'t be more ridiculous. He\'s got these three lameos doing his security and this crappy video surveillance.

However, David Engelbach would instead write the screenplay for the estimated 6 million dollar production. Michael Winner clarified that producers Menahem Golan and Yoram Globus were unsatisfied with Garfield\'s 1974 sequel to his novel, so they purchased the rights to Garfield\'s characters, which would allow them to create their own story. Cannon obtained the property from Dino De Laurentiis and Paramount Pictures, who released the first film.

For days on end, Bronson and Nick Dimitri would square off under the hot lights, watched intently by McGuire and his hoods, James Coburn, and Strother Martin - and a few dozen cameramen, technicians, and crew members. The first thing a visitor to that set would have noticed was the overwhelming smell of the place.

""Hard Times"" features the usual quota. The Cornstalk Hotel, a familiar sight to Quarter residents, appears in the background when Charles Bronson tells Jill Ireland the nature of his profession - street-fighting - and also as the residence of the slick gambler-promoter played by James Coburn. Another scene shot in the Quarter is that in which Coburn makes the mistake of trying to thrash Bronson for making a play after Coburn\'s girl, a charge as ill-conceived as Coburn\'s lunges at the powerful street-fighter.', u'According to cinematographer Philip H. Lathrop, more than a few difficulties had to be surmounted in order to shoot on actual sets rather than on a soundstage. Lathrop said: ""It\'s a wholly different type of treatment because you\'re working on actual sets and you have to invent a lot of different things that you need not do in the studio, where you can remove a wall or have lights above on the scaffolds. But it gets done"".', u'Walter Hill wrote one draft, then rewrote it ""five or six times before I finally got it. But I did get it and I knew it. I knew it was going to get an actor and get made.""', u'Walter Hill says his cinematographer Philip H. Lathrop was incredibly useful during the shoot:""Before we started I was in my office later at night and Lathrop came by, noted I wasn\'t in a good mood. ""Anything wrong?"" I had never done it, worried if I will make it look alright. He immediately said ""Don\'t worry about that. We will make a film, make the shots. If you are having a problem we will make the shots. I can already tell you you are ahead of other directors."" He said ""Anything we shoot we will cut together."" He said ""The problem that you\'re going to have is making everybody getting along and you getting what you want."" And he was of course 100 percent right. That is the problem with direction.

Film Critic Roger Ebert has said of this: ""Kaplan was the scion of an American sugar-and-molasses empire with Latin American connections, and in the early 1960s, he was a courier for Fidel Castro. The Mexicans imprisoned him in 1962 on a highly questionable murder charge, and there were rumors that the CIA was somehow involved. He was in prison nine years before his sister hired a California helicopter pilot to carry out a neat little mission spiriting Kaplan out of the prison yard. Ramparts published material about the CIA connection, but Kaplan wouldn\'t talk, then or later. The movie\'s naturally more concerned with the rescue mission than with any shadowy political implications. But there are a couple of leftovers from the original story in the sinister persons of a CIA operative and the hero\'s rich grandfather. They seem to be in cahoots, although how or why is a little unclear.""', u'Because this movie was based on a real-life prison escape in Mexico, the Mexican Government would not permit the movie to be filmed there.', u'This was the first major studio film to be released in the now-common saturation pattern, debuting at over 1000 movie theaters simultaneously with 1300 prints in the USA. This was coupled with 17000 advertising radio spots. The Columbia studio claimed that this was ""the most spectacular saturation blitz of any motion picture"". Soon after, this wide release method was used for Jaws (1975) as well.', u'Actor Robert Duvall became interested in the gypsy culture whilst working with gypsy extras on the set of this movie. Duvall drew on this experience as a writer-director when he later made the film Angelo My Love (1983) about eight years later.', u""This movie was made and released about two years after its source book 'Ten Second Jailbreak' was first published in 1973. The book's full title is actually 'The Ten-Second Jailbreak: The Helicopter Escape Of Joel David Kaplan'. The authors were Warren Hinckle, William Turner and Eliot Asinof."", u'The picture was originally set to star Robert Duvall and Kris Kristofferson in the Charles Bronson role of Nick Colton but Kristofferson withdrew from the film and in the end Bronson was cast in that part.', u'This Charles Bronson movie was theatrically released between between his pictures Death Wish (1974) and Hard Times (1975).', u'Actor Randy Quaid is seen in drag in this movie.', u'The helicopter used for the breakout scene is an Aerospatiale SA.313/318 Alouette II powered by a gas turbine engine, while the sound was dubbed from a Bell 47 piston-engined helicopter.

Huston left the picture due to creative differences with the films' producers having filmed just a few scenes and was replaced with director Stuart Rosenberg."", u'This movie is one of only two pictures starring Charles Bronson which use alliteration rhyming his last name with the picture\'s title. The words BRONSON - BREAKOUT share the same first two letters: ""B"" and ""r"". The other movie which also did this was Breakheart Pass (1975), interestingly, made by the same director (Tom Gries) and also made in the same year.', u'This movie was the first of two pictures that star Charles Bronson made with director Tom Gries. The second, made in the same year as this movie but mostly released in 1976, was Breakheart Pass (1975). The two had also previously worked in television together.', u'Though based on a true life story of a real prison escape, publicity for this picture actually said that it was fictional.', u'Actors Paul Mantee and Robert Duvall both share a scene in this film and would later both appear together again in The Great Santini (1979). The two also featured in The Greatest (1977). Breakout (1975) was the first of the three pictures that they both acted in.', u'The prison of the story was supposed to be in Mexico. But director Tom Gries insisted that there was no prison in Mexico suitably impregnable where he could obtain maximum dramatic impact for the breakout action sequences. So, Gries took his cast and crew, his camera and his lights, to the Pyrenees in the south of France. Here, on a mountaintop near Perpignan, sits the grim pile known as the ""Fort de Bellegarde"". A single lane track winds up around the mountain to this bastion. The lore of the district is that, when the Nazi Gestapo used it as a high-security prison during World War II, many more men walked up that forbidding path than ever came down it.', u'Much of ""Breakout"" was filmed in the air. The helicopter camera plane, piloted by noted helicopter pilot flyer Jim Gavin [James W. Gavin], was used with the same mobility as a camera boom. It filmed actress Jill Ireland driving a top-down convertible speeding on a California-highway. Twenty feet above the car, director Tom Gries directed his star by walkie-talkie from the co-pilot\'s seat. On occasion, dialogue scenes taking place in a Piper Family Cruiser plane in full flight were taken from the chopper traveling at the same speed only a few yards away as, according to the story, the Piper raced across Mexico and flew at a very low level to evade radar detection. Flight expert Gavin commented at the time: ""I believe \'Breakout\' has some of the most exciting flight footage that\'s been shot since \'Howard Hughes\' made Hell\'s Angels (1930)"".', u'This film was the second consecutive Charles Bronson movie that depicted a rape. The previous film was Death Wish (1974).', u'Charles Bronson was about fifty-three years of age when he appeared in this movie.', u'This movie ""Breakout"" is based on Vic Stadter\'s real life adventure.', u'This movie represents a handful of films made starring Charles Bronson that deal with Mexico and Chicano characters. The pictures are Breakout (1975), Mr. Majestyk (1974) and Borderline (2008).', u'Actress Jill Ireland was the real-life wife of Charles Bronson but in this movie plays the wife of Robert Duvall.', u'\'Time Out\' said that this movie had ""a number of obvious plagiarisms (Chinatown (1974), Charley Varrick (1973), Thunderbolt and Lightfoot (1974))"".', u'Eighth star teaming of husband and wife actor and actress Charles Bronson and Jill Ireland.', u'Every frame of film for ""Breakout"" was shot on an actual location carefully dressed to simulate the setting where, according to the fictional story, the action happened. Thus, bush pilot Charles Bronson\'s run-down airfield located, according to the screenplay, in Texas was actually Hawkins\' Airport near Lancaster, California. It was made realistically Texan by truckloads of Fuller\'s Earth, tumbleweed, and sagebrush activated by off-camera wind machines.', u'The border airport, where prisoner Robert Duvall finally passes by U. S. Immigration officials to freedom, was actually a conversion of the Santa Monica, California Municipal Airport. Two other airports in the Los Angeles area served as backgrounds for the adventure - a private field near Burbank became the helicopter flying school where Charles Bronson learns how to fly the chopper into the prison, and an airstrip in a hidden valley near Newhall, California is the transfer point where the escaped prisoner gets out of the helicopter and into a small plane for the run to the border.', u'One of the film\'s main movie posters described the following six characters and cast members and some of their previous pictures as follows: ""Charles Bronson, the hit man of Death Wish (1974).""; ""Robert Duvall, the brains behind The Godfather (1972).""; ""Jill Ireland, has a proposition for an escape.""; ""Randy Quaid; the law breaking sailor from The Last Detail (1973).""; ""John Huston, the big boss of Chinatown (1974).""; and ""Sheree North, has a sure way to distract prison guards."".', u""Charles Bronson has a line that is a quick reference to The Great Escape. While talking to Jill Ireland he asks if they're going to build two tunnels in case one is discovered. In The Great Escape, the prisoners build three tunnels.

When Sergio Leone saw them, he ordered them removed. Leone had planned an important close-up shot of Frank\'s entrance and wanted the audience to instantly recognize Fonda with those blue eyes.', u'Al Mulock, who played one of the three gunmen in the opening sequence, committed suicide by jumping from his hotel window in full costume after a day\'s shooting. Production manager Claudio Mancini and screenwriter Mickey Knox, who were sitting in a room in the hotel, witnessed Mulock\'s body pass by their window. Knox recalled in an interview that while Mancini put Mulock in his car to drive him to the hospital, director Sergio Leone said to Mancini, ""Get the costume! We need the costume!"" Mulock, who had appeared as the one-armed bounty hunter in Leone\'s The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966), was wearing the costume he wore in the movie when he made his fatal leap.', u'The main selling point to producers for the use of the Techniscope process was the savings in camera negative; but, another advantage was being able to derive the 2.35:1 aspect ratio while shooting with spherical lenses which avoided the distortion created by anamorphics during certain camera moves and extreme close-ups (such as those used by Sergio Leone). This film, together with The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966) (also directed by Leone and shot by Tonino Delli Colli) are now considered masterpieces in the use of the Techniscope system.', u'When Henry Fonda was trying to decide whether to be in this film, he asked his friend Eli Wallach, who had just made The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966) with Sergio Leone, if he should take the part of Frank. Wallach said that he had to do it and told Fonda, ""You will have the time of your life."" (Similarly, it was Fonda, saying he considered Leone one of the greatest directors he ever worked with, who persuaded James Coburn to take the part of Mallory in the second ""Once Upon a Time..."" film, Duck, You Sucker (1971).)', u""For the opening sequence where the three dusters waited for the train, filmmakers lightly coated the face of Jack Elam with jam and began filming close-ups while letting a fly out of a jar filled with flies, attempting to get Elam's reaction as one would land on his cheek."", u'This marked the first of the last three films to be fully directed by Sergio Leone. All three of his last films would be edited for U.S. distribution, resulting in box-office failure in the U.S. (although the longer international versions would be successful in other countries). In Italy an even longer version of the movie was released. It does not exist in an English dubbed version.', u'The original intent for the opening scene was to use music already composed by composer Ennio Morricone; however, the attempted blend didn\'t seem to fit well. The decision was made to drop Morricone\'s score from the opening train station sequence and record the ambient sounds relating to the scenes (including the squeaking windmill and individual footsteps) after Morricone experienced a musical performance created by using only the sounds of a metal ladder. This created an exaggerated version of what had come to be known as ""spaghetti sound.""', u'After completing the Dollars trilogy (A Fistful of Dollars (1964), For a Few Dollars More (1965), and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966)), Sergio Leone didn\'t want to do another western and began working on Once Upon a Time in America (1984); however, after the huge success of the Dollars Trilogy in the States in 1967, Leone wanted to produce films in the US and he began selling the idea for ""Once Upon a Time in America"", but studios wouldn\'t let him do it until he made another western for them. Eventually Leone decided to create another trilogy which begins with Once Upon a Time in the West (1968), develops into Duck, You Sucker (1971) and ends with Once Upon a Time in America. The \'\'Once Upon a Time\'\' trilogy, as it is often referred to, is effectively about ""three historical periods which toughened America"".', u'The credits, concluding with Director Sergio Leone, last over ten minutes into the start of the film.', u""The final duel between Frank and Harmonica is shot almost exactly like the one in Robert Aldrich's The Last Sunset (1961) between Rock Hudson and Kirk Douglas, a film, of which, Bernardo Bertolucci was a huge fan."", u""Sergio Leone originally offered the role of Harmonica to Clint Eastwood, but he turned it down, as he was no longer interested in working for Leone. James Coburn was also approached for the role of Harmonica, but demanded too much money. The role went to Charles Bronson, who had previously turned down roles in the Dollars Trilogy (Eastwood's in A Fistful of Dollars (1964) and Lee Van Cleef's in For a Few Dollars More (1965) and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966))."", u'Jason Robards showed up at the set completely drunk on the first day of filming, and Sergio Leone threatened to fire him if he ever did that again. Robards was generally well-behaved thereafter, though in June 1968, after receiving word of the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy, he broke down and refused to perform until the day was over, and Leone decided to stop filming for the day.', u""Over half of the film's budget was spent on the actors' salaries."", u""Co-writer Bernardo Bertolucci says on the film's DVD that when he first suggested to director Sergio Leone that the film's central character be a woman, Leone was hesitant. Leone first budged on this subject by suggesting the introductory shot of Jill would be from below the train platform so the camera could see under Jill's dress and show she wasn't wearing any undergarments. Claudia Cardinale says she was never told this idea and says she probably wouldn't have agreed to be in the movie if it required this shot (suggesting that Leone, mercifully, gave up on the idea in the writing process)."", u""Although Lionel Stander's establishment is located in Monument Valley, the interiors were actually shot at Cinecitta.

She was the wife of actor Woody Strode.', u'Sergio Leone made hundreds of references to films that influenced him. Some were quite obvious (like three men waiting for the train as in High Noon (1952)) and some were very subtle, like the choice of Woody Strode\'s sawed-off Winchester rifle, similar to the weapon Steve McQueen carried in the TV series Wanted: Dead or Alive (1958).

However, Leone decided not to cast her because he feared that she would try to gain too much dominance and influence on how the film was made, given her famously headstrong and temperamental personality.

Borgnine wrote Marvin was lucky that Brown was not there to hear it."", u'""The Dirty Dozen"" author E.M. Nathanson may have gotten the idea for the title (if not the plot) of his best-selling novel from a real-life group of World War II 101st Airborne Division paratroopers nicknamed ""The Filthy Thirteen."" These men, demolitionists in Headquarters Company of the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment of the 101st, supposedly earned their nickname by not bathing or shaving for a long period of time during training prior to the Normandy invasion. Members of The Filthy Thirteen can be seen in famous vintage film footage and still photos, their faces painted with Indian ""war paint,"" before boarding their planes for the D-Day jump. Another idea source for Nathanson\'s book may have come from future director Russ Meyer, who was at the time a combat cameraman. He had shot some footage of a group of American soldiers--inmates at a military prison who were under death sentence for such crimes as murder, rape and mutiny--who were training at a secret location for the D-Day invasion, for which they would be parachuted behind German lines to commit acts of sabotage and assassinations. Prison authorities told Meyer that the men, who volunteered, were told that if they survived and returned their sentences would be set aside, their records expunged and they would be set free. Guards told him that the group was called ""the dirty dozen"" because they refused to bathe or shave. After the invasion Meyer made inquiries as to these men\'s fates, and was told that none of them came back. After the war he related this story to Nathanson, who was a friend of his.', u'The film was controversial when it was released, as it depicted Allied soldiers as no different than Nazis.', u'During World War II, the American forces did indeed ""borrow"" a prison in the UK for housing U.S. servicemen convicted of criminal acts. This was Shepton Mallett prison in Somerset, which operated as a prison from 1625 to 2013. During the war nine U.S. military personnel were executed there--three by firing squad, six by hanging. The hangman used was the British Albert Pierrepoint, who in his career hanged approximately 450 people, including some 200 Nazis convicted is the Nuremburg war crimes trials.', u'Lee Marvin related a joke Robert Aldrich pulled on Charles Bronson, who was only about 5\'9"" and wore low boxing shoes during rehearsal.

According to Marvin, Aldrich laughed for about ten minutes over Bronson\'s perturbed reaction.', u""John Wayne was first offered the part of Major John Reisman, but he declined. The part was then offered to Lee Marvin, who took it. Wayne's refusal was due to his disapproval of the original script, in which Reisman has a brief affair with a married woman whose husband is fighting overseas. Other sources say Wayne turned the film down because he did not want to be making a movie in the UK when his third wife Pilar was due to give birth in February 1966."", u'Many of the actors were too old to play World War II soldiers.', u""MGM's biggest moneymaker of 1967."", u'Lee Marvin had high praise for all the men in the film, commenting that everyone was ideally cast ""and even when they ad-libbed a scene, invariably it was in character, so all it could do was to help the film.""', u""Charles Bronson didn't care for the film, claiming it was too violent.

It came into use late in the war, replacing Thompson submachine guns (aka ""Tommy guns""). It was not a general-issue weapon to infantrymen but normally used as the crew weapon on a tank. Many ""found"" their way to the front-line troops, however. This earlier model weapon had a charging lever on the side. Later models (M3A1) were charged by simply pulling back on the bolt by inserting your finger into a recess in the bolt. The M3A1 wire stock included a tab to help load magazines, the ends threaded to accept a cleaning brush to clean the barrel and was used as a wrench to unscrew the barrel for disassembly. The weapon, only manufactured during WWII by General Motors Headlight division, cost about $20 to produce, as opposed to the Thompson which cost several hundred.', u""One of the German guards killed at the checkpoint ended up with a promotion.

The scene was considered controversial because the Germans (including women) were locked inside the bunker and had no chance to survive. Aldrich considered it but elected to leave the scene in to show that ""war is hell"".', u""As film production ran over schedule, Frank Sinatra advised Trini L\xf3pez to quit so that his recording career wouldn't lose its momentum or popularity. Lopez took Sinatra's advice and quit. Another account is that his agent demanded more money, which Robert Aldrich refused to grant.

While the show does feature some similarities to the case, Roy Huggins consistently denied that he based Richard Kimble on Sheppard or the fictional murder on the real one. Claiming that he was unfamiliar with the Sheppard case until the series began, he said the show was actually influenced by his love for Westerns, and he wanted to do a series about a modern character roaming around the country in a similar fashion to a mythic cowboy.', u'At times guest actresses would try to flatter Bill Raisch by speaking about how special effects allowed him to fake missing an arm - unaware that Raisch actually only had one arm.', u'Barry Morse recalls that he was in a London restaurant when a waiter handed him a note. It read, ""Kimble is in the kitchen.""', u'Legend has it, that after completing the first episode, David Janssen walked up the road with Barry Morse and said, ""Do you think we will get a couple of weeks work out of this?""', u""ABC executives initially objected to the idea of a series finale because they feared that it would hurt the show's syndication profits."", u""David Janssen was working on The Green Berets (1968) when the final episode of this series aired; when Part Two of the episode was aired, he was interviewed on Joey Bishop's ABC nighttime program from Fort Benning, Georgia, where he commented on the series' finale."", u""While originally conceived as a modern-day western, many plot points were also taken from Victor Hugo's Les Miserables. Like Jean Valjean, Richard Kimble is on the run from the law and must frequently change locales to stay free. His pursuer, Gerard, is both inspired by and named after Inspector Javert."", u'Robert Lansing, James Franciscus and Anthony Franciosa were all considered for the role of Richard Kimble.', u""The train transporting Richard Kimble to death row in the series' opening credits is clearly a French one, not American."", u'The show was so popular that a German magazine wanted to stage a contest in which David Janssen would be stalked by its readers through the streets of Berlin.', u""A running gag had Kimble staying in the rundown 'Edmund Hotel' in many episodes. This was due to many scenes being filmed on the studio backlot, where the art director had created a standing set of a typical downtown street, including the false-front entrance to the 'Edmund Hotel'. This gave the impression, as Kimble crisscrossed the country, that nearly every major American city had a fleabag 'Edmund Hotel' in which Kimble could find lodging."", u'The train derailment sequence in the opening credits with the words ""Chemin de Fer"" is stock footage taken from the 1938 movie ""The Young in Heart,"" starring Janet Gaynor and Douglas Fairbanks Jr, produced by David O Selznick/UA. Gaynor is one of the figures propping up older woman Minnie Dupree as they walk away from the train.', u'Roy Huggins originally intended to have a villain with red hair, but he felt that it was such a common characteristic that he decided against it. Instead, he chose to have a one-armed man.', u'Roy Huggins initially had great difficulty selling the series to potential producers. Many thought that a series based on a wrongfully convicted man running from the law would be too perverse, as well as a slap in the face to the American justice system. Producers felt that no one would want to watch such a series and urged Huggins to give up on the concept.', u""The theme music and its variations was recorded in London at the CTS Studios in Bayswater, using around 50 musicians from the Ted Heath and London Philharmonic Orchestra. The Conductor was Harry Rabinowitz. Sound Engineer was Eric Tomlinson. All 120 episodes were scored with the same 'library music' that was recorded at the start of production and not tailored to specific scenes in the show."", u""According to the book The Fugitive Recaptured, ABC announced in April 1966 that the series would film episodes in Mexico, Puerto Rico, and Hawaii. This never came to pass but may have occurred had the series gone to an originally-planned fifth season, a plan vetoed by David Janssen because he was physically worn out from the demanding shooting schedule. At this April 1966 announcement ABC also disclosed that they would add a young son for Kimble for the show's fourth season, in an attempt to draw more younger viewers. This plan was aborted in a May 1966 press conference when ABC realized the idea would not work given the specter of Lieutenant Gerard."", u'In the final 2 ""Judgment"" episodes as well as a few others in the last year, music cues that were composed by Dominic Frontiere for The Outer Limits, \'12 O\'Clock High (1962)\', and \'Branded (1964)\' were added to the tracking of those episodes though he was not credited for that in the End Credits. Also used were cues from the DBS Music Library composed by Bernard Herrmann and Jerry Goldsmith as well as from Capitol\'s music library.', u""Ken Wilhoit, the series' music editor, was married to Susan Hayes, who'd had an affair with Dr. Sam Sheppard, on whose case the show is widely believed to have been based, and who appeared as a prosecution witness against him."", u""Barry Morse had said that on more than one occasion he was accosted by elderly ladies in supermarkets, telling him to 'leave that nice Dr Kimble alone', telling him that a one-armed man is the TRUE killer."", u'It\'s been stated that the show\'s instrumental theme song, bares an eerie similarity to the classic early 60\'s love song, ""When I Fall In Love"", which most famously (in vocal form) was sung by The Letterman. Especially true where a slower & more \'mournful\' sounding version plays over certain scenes.', u'In a 1993 interview, Jacqueline Scott remembers David Janssen with great affection. ""He was a very sweet man. But there was a part of him that was kind of quiet and removed. Although he was very outgoing, and friendly, and funny, I think that was the part of him that was very interesting on that show.""', u'The science fiction book ""Prison Satellite"" by Leo P. Kelley was considered to be a futuristic version of The Fugitive (1963). The book is about space cop Officer Barry Marks whom (Like Sam Gerard) goes after convicted prisoner Kirkland whom has escaped from a prison satellite.', u'William Shatner, DeForest Kelley and James Doohan all appeared on this series before appearing together on Star Trek.', u'Neal Sabin, the programming mastermind behind Me-TV, praises David Janssen: ""David Janssen was in every episode of this series and in almost every scene. That speaks to his talent.""', u'Until the ""Who Shot J.R.?"" episode of Dallas (1978), the finale of this series where Kimball finally catches the ""One Armed Man"" was the highest-rated episode in the history of television.']","[u'USA::17 September 1963', u'UK::7 January 1964', u'West Germany::9 July 1965', u'France::1 October 1967']",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

However, as he was still living at the time the film was produced and was still a committed Nazi, his character was quickly changed to a fictitious officer in the regular German army, so as not to give him any connection to the film or risk a libel suit. It was Peiper's unit (Kampfgruppe Peiper) of the 1st SS Division, Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler that was responsible for the massacre of American POWs in Malmedy, Belgium, depicted--although inaccurately--in the film. After the war he was convicted of war crimes and sentenced to death, but the sentence was commuted by the American Occupation Force because the trial had been fraught with illegalities, and Peiper wound up serving only 11 years in prison, despite having perpetrated war crimes on both the Eastern and Western fronts.

It said that Columbia Pictures had long had an epic movie in the works about the battle that had the cooperation of the Defense Department, as well as many of the generals who had been involved, including Eisenhower and Bernard L. Montgomery. The working title of Columbia\'s movie was ""16th of December:The Battle of the Bulge."" Michael Anderson was slated to direct from a screenplay written by Byron Morgan and Tony Lazzarino, and the project was to be co-produced by Lazzorino and Kenneth T. Hoeck. The former president\'s son John S.D. Eisenhower was writing a companion history of the battle and serving as technical advisor. Anderson was quoted as hoping to have Van Heflin as Eisenhower, David Niven as Montgomery, John Wayne as Gen. George S. Patton and Laurence Olivier as Adolf Hitler. Shortly after Columbia announced that filming would begin during the winter of 1964, Warner Brothers registered the title ""The Battle of the Bulge"" and announced that it was going to make its own fictional movie, upsetting the plans for Columbia\'s epic. Columbia obtained an injunction against Warners, dropping it after Warners agreed that its picture would not use the names of any of the real-life figures that had contributed to Columbia\'s project, such as Eisenhower, Montgomery, Omar Bradley, Anthony McAuliffe, Patton and 10 other figures. The Defense Department had also urged a Federal Trade Commission action against the movie on the grounds that its title was misleading the public. When the article appeared it stated that Columbia\'s project would go forward, with filming to begin at Camp Drum near Watertown, NY, in the fall of 1966, but the project fell through and the film was never made.', u'German King Tiger tanks in this movie are actually American M47 Patton tanks, and the M4 Sherman tanks are actually M24 Chaffee tanks.', u""The film's senior military advisor, Brig.

This planes was used after WWII and is distinguished from the Piper L-4 Grasshopper by its raised cockpit, angled side windows and rounded rear window. These were not initially purpose-built military planes. The Cessna 305A was the military version of the 170, a small civil aviation plane popular with private pilots. Its ability to take off and land in relatively short distances on dirt fields made it very useful to troops operating in remote or forward areas. Though completely unarmed, they carried out a number of vital missions including reconnaissance, artillery spotting, supply drop and even air ambulance.', u'The sequence of the train transporting the big guns was expanded with additional footage shot after principal photography. The extra footage consisted of POV shots from the front of the train and shot at a lower frame rate to make the train appear to be traveling very fast around the curves in the track. This was done to show off the Cinerama process in much the same way as the famous rollercoaster sequence in This Is Cinerama (1952).

Michael Landon later recalled that when Greene did the stunt, he jumped into the water feet first and went completely under, but his hair piece came off and floated on the surface of the lake. Landon and the rest of the crew watched to see what would happen. After a short while, Greene's hand shot up out of the water, grabbed the hairpiece, and pulled it down. Greene emerged from the lake, wearing his hairpiece slightly askew. He walked nonchalantly past the snickering crew, and went into his trailer without saying a word."", u'When Dan Blocker died unexpectedly shortly before filming began for the final season, it was decided to have Hoss die, too, by having him killed in an accident. The opening episode, a two-hour special in which Little Joe marries only to see his bride die, was originally scripted to feature Hoss.', u'Dan Blocker owned a chain of restaurants called ""Bonanza"". They were steakhouses similar to the ""Golden Corral"" chain. When the ownership later changed, all of the restaurants were later renamed ""Ponderosa"".', u'According to the 1973 book ""Marilyn Beck\'s Hollywood"", when Pernell Roberts told Lorne Greene he was leaving the series because he wanted to challenge himself as an actor, Greene told him to stick to it as he would be so rich by the end of the run he could hire Tennessee Williams himself to write a play for him. Roberts\' career went into a tailspin that lasted over a decade after he left the show. Co-star Michael Landon later said of Roberts\' departure that they simply took a leaf out of the dining room table and split the money three rather than four ways. While the post-""Bonanza"" Roberts struggled (until later catching on with Trapper John, M.D. (1979), Greene, Landon and Dan Blocker became very wealthy from their income from the show, which all three wisely invested in.', u""During the first season of the show the guest stars were paid far more than the stars of the show, because the producers didn't think that the stars were well-known enough to pull in viewers."", u'Although it got off to a rough start, by 1961 it was the #1 show on TV.', u""Saturday nights ratings were dismal and the show was soon targeted for cancellation. Given one last chance, it was moved to Sunday nights at 9:00 p.m. The new time slot caused the series to soar, and it eventually reached #1 by the mid-'60s."", u'Most viewers have only heard the famous theme song by Jay Livingston and Ray Evans played as an instrumental. The theme song actually had lyrics and there is footage of the lead actors singing those lyrics. Lorne Greene, Dan Blocker and Michael Landon sang a lyric version of this famous instrumental theme for the pilot, but it never aired. Johnny Cash recorded his own version of the theme song.', u'According to David Dortort, Michael Landon grew difficult during the last five seasons the show ran: ""Nearly every line, every scene, every set up . . . everything would halt for endless story conferences on the set . . . it got increasingly bitter toward the end.""', u'The character ""Ben Cartwright"" was ranked #2 in TV Guide\'s list of the ""50 Greatest TV Dads of All Time"" (20 June 2004 issue).', u""In the show's early episodes the writers would typically have the Cartwrights being hostile to visitors to their property. Lorne Greene objected to this, pointing out that with the Ponderosa being as large as it is, the Cartwrights would be an important business interest in the community. Thus visitors would naturally come for economic and political reasons as well as social ones and the Cartwrights would logically welcome them as such. The producers agreed and altered the premise of the characters accordingly."", u'From the third season on, the Cartwrights and nearly every other recurring character on the show wore the same clothing in almost every episode. This was done to cut the cost of re-filming action shots (such as riding clips in-between scenes), as previously-shot stock footage could be reused.', u'Lasting 14 seasons, it is among the longest-running Western television series (second behind Gunsmoke (1955)) and continues to air in syndication.', u'This was the first US Western television show to have all its episodes filmed in color.', u""In 1968 Dan Blocker began wearing a toupee on the series, as he was approaching 40 years of age and beginning to lose his hair. He joined the ranks of his fellow co-stars Pernell Roberts and Lorne Greene, both of whom began the series with hairpieces (Greene wore his modest frontal piece in private life, too, whereas Roberts preferred not wearing his, even to rehearsals/blocking). Michael Landon was the only original cast member who was wig-free throughout the series, as even Victor Sen Yung's Hop Sing wore an attached queue (ponytail)."", u""For most of its 430-episode run the show's main sponsor was Chevrolet, The stars occasionally appeared in commercials endorsing Chevrolet automobiles."", u'A recurring situation was that every time one of the Cartwrights became seriously involved with a woman, she died from a malady, was slain, or left with someone else.', u'The last 14 episodes of Season One and the first 17 episodes of Season Two have fallen into the public domain. These 31 episodes have been released by many different companies in many different configurations, usually with the familiar theme music replaced with generic music. Starting with episode 1.19, the 31 episodes in order are: ""The Gunmen"", ""The Fear Merchants"", ""The Spanish Grant"", ""Blood on the Land"", ""Desert Justice"", ""The Stranger"", ""Escape to Ponderosa"", ""The Avenger"", ""The Last Trophy"", ""San Francisco Holiday"" (aka ""San Francisco""), ""Bitter Water"", ""Feet of Clay"", ""Dark Star"", ""Death at Dawn"", ""Showdown"", ""The Mission"", ""Badge Without Honor"", ""The Mill"", ""The Hopefuls"", ""Denver McKee"", ""Day of Reckoning"", ""The Abduction"", ""Breed of Violence"", ""The Last Viking"", ""The Trail Gang"", ""The Savage"", ""Silent Thunder"", ""The Ape"", ""The Blood Line"", ""The Courtship"" and ""The Spitfire"".', u'The opening burning map of the Ponderosa Ranch was illustrated without compass points, which caused the map to appear to be incorrectly oriented (i.e., Reno appeared to be west of Carson City. David Dortort, choosing not to redo the map, added the compass points. Many have suggested that the compass points are pointing in the wrong direction (slightly north-northwest), but in reality the compass points are aligned with Magnetic North instead of True North.', u'Both Robert Blake and Robert Fuller were considered for the role of Little Joe Cartwright, but lost to Michael Landon. This was because producer David Dortort had mixed feelings about the new, unfamiliar actor auditioning for the part, thinking Landon was way too young to play the role. With the encouragement of his wife, who picked up a publicity still of Landon, Dortort changed his mind and gave Landon the role.', u'Michael Landon wore four-inch lifts in the series.', u'Bonanza was not the first television western series to be completely shot in color as stated elsewhere. That honor goes to The Cisco Kid (1950 - 1956). Bonanza was the first ""network"" television western to air completely in color.', u'Several major actors from the original Star Trek (1966) series appeared as guest stars at one time or another on the show: William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelley, James Doohan, George Takei, Nichelle Nichols, Grace Lee Whitney, Majel Barrett and Walter Koenig.', u'For a long time producer David Dortort refused to allow Michael Landon to write scripts for the show. It took many failed attempts by Landon before he eventually submitted a script that Dortort thought good enough to make. After this he became a regular writer for the series and later would re-work many of his scripts for new episodes of Little House on the Prairie (1974).', u'Pernell Roberts was not a popular member of the cast either with his co-stars or the crew. He continually complained about the show feeling it was poor quality and beneath him as an actor as well as ignoring co-star Michael Landon to whom he very rarely, if ever, spoke.', u'Anthony Lawrence didn\'t write authentic Western scripts so he focused on writing about relationships and character (as he did in Bonanza: Dark Star (1960) and Bonanza: The Last Viking (1960), for example). One day, producer David Dortort told Lawrence he wanted to do a story on each of Ben\'s wives, and the screenwriter replied, ""Let me do it, I can kill off at least two of them!"" Lawrence thought he would get thrown off the set for saying this, and instead was given the task of becoming the writer who scripted the stories with Ben and his wives, all three of whom died (Bonanza: Elizabeth, My Love (1961), Bonanza: Inger, My Love (1962), Bonanza: Journey Remembered (1963), and Bonanza: Marie, My Love (1963)).', u'Lorne Greene was only 13 years older than Pernell Roberts.', u'Bonanza: Ride the Wind: Part 1 (1966) and Bonanza: Ride the Wind: Part 2 (1966) were released as a theatrical film outside the US. In Mexico it was called ""Jinetes del Viento"".', u'Pernell Roberts objected to the racist portrayal of minorities in the series.', u'In their Television Archives interview, Ray Evans and Jay Livingston said when Desi Arnaz asked them to write a theme song for a Western television show, he told them he could not pay them much for a weekly salary, because the show was only going to last one year. The men made a deal with Desi to keep the rights to the song. When Bonanza became an unexpected smash-hit, owning the rights to the song, the men made millions.', u'The brothers Adam, Hoss, and Joe were not full brothers, but half brothers. Same father, different mothers.', u""Before becoming a rancher, Ben Cartwright was a ship's Captain. His port of call was New Orleans ."", u'After 11 seasons the show\'s theme music was replaced at the start of Season 12 by an original tune composed by David Rose. Rose would continue to work with Michael Landon after ""Bonanza"" ceased production by becoming the resident composer on Landon\'s two later series ""Little House on the Prairie"" and ""Highway to Heaven"".', u""Hoss' given name is Eric, his mother was Ben's second wife, Inger."", u""One piece of footage was used often, of the main street in Virginia City.

As a result of his work in the coal mines, Bronson suffered from claustrophobia just as his character had.', u""During the climactic motorcycle chase, John Sturges allowed Steve McQueen to ride (in disguise) as one of the pursuing German soldiers, so that in the final sequence, through the magic of editing, he's actually chasing himself. McQueen played the German motorcyclist who hits the wire."", u'During idle periods while The Great Escape (1963) was in production, all cast and crew members - from stars Steve McQueen and James Garner to production assistants and obscure food service workers - were asked to take thin, five-inch strings of black rubber and knot them around other thin strings of black rubber of enormous length. The finished results of all this knotting were the coils and fences of barbed wire seen throughout the film.', u'Donald Pleasence had actually been a Royal Air Force pilot in World War II, who was shot down, became a prisoner of war and was tortured by the Germans. When he kindly offered advice to the film\'s director John Sturges, he was politely asked to keep his ""opinions"" to himself. Later, when another star from the film informed John Sturges that Pleasence had actually been a RAF Officer in a World War II German POW Stalag camp, Sturges requested his technical advice and input on historical accuracy from that point forward.', u""Although Steve McQueen did his own motorcycle riding, there was one stunt he did not perform: the hair-raising 60-foot jump over a fence. This was done by McQueen's friend Bud Ekins, who was managing a Los Angeles-area motorcycle shop when recruited for the stunt. It was the beginning of a new career for Ekins, as he later doubled for McQueen in Bullitt (1968) and did much of the motorcycle riding on the television series CHiPs (1977)."", u'Several cast members were actual P.O.W.s during World War II.

The inclusion of chocolate, coffee and cigarettes in Red Cross packages is well documented, as is their use to bribe Nazi guards. Other materials useful for escaping had to be kept secret and were not included in the novel or screenplay. Also not revealed until many years later was the fact that the prisoners actually built a fourth tunnel called ""George.""', u'Paul Brickhill, who wrote the book from which the film is based, was piloting a Spitfire aircraft that was shot down over Tunisia in March 1943. He was taken to Stalag Luft III in Germany, where he assisted in the escape preparations.', u'Steve McQueen accepted the role of Hilts on the condition that he got to show off his motorcycle skills.', u""The film was shot entirely on location in Europe, with a complete camp resembling Stalag Luft III built near Munich, Germany. Exteriors for the escape sequences were shot in the Rhine Country and areas near the North Sea, and Steve McQueen's motorcycle scenes were filmed in Fussen (on the Austrian border) and the Alps. All interiors were filmed at the Bavaria Studio in Munich."", u'When celebrating the Fourth of July and pouring alcohol, Hilts (Steve McQueen) is thrown off by an ad-lib by Goff (Jud Taylor). While Hilts is drinking, Goff says, ""No taxation without representation."" McQueen jumps out of character and gives him a look (and mouths, ""What?"") The director must have signaled to ""just go with it"" and the scene continues. But it is an obvious ad-lib.', u""In the film, several Americans (including Hilts and Henley) were among the escapees. In real life, American officers assisted with the construction of the escape tunnel, but weren't among the escapees because the Germans moved them to a remote compound just before the escape."", u'The song sung by Ives & McDonald on 4th July is ""Wha Hae the 42nd?"" Contrary to common belief it is not in Gaelic but a light Scots dialect of English. The 42nd Regiment of Foot was the Scottish regiment in the British Army known as the Black Watch.', u'The actual camp - Stalag Luft III - was located in Zagan, Poland and the remains of the camp can be found at the following map coordinates: 51.599036, 15.310030', u""Most of the planes in the airfield are actually American AT-6 Texan trainers painted with a German paint scheme, but the one actually flown is an authentic German plane, a Bucker Bu 181 'Bestmann.'"", u'The tunnel sets were were constructed of wood and skins filled with plaster and dirt and open on one side with a dolly track running the length of the set in order to shoot scenes of prisoners scooting along through them.', u""The medal that Colonel von Luger wears around his neck is the Pour le Merite, also known as the Blue Max.

The Nazis replaced it with the Knight's Cross but it could still be worn by officers who'd won it before the Third Reich."", u'Although the German airfield displays mainly North American AT-6 Texan trainers, it is feasible that this was authentic. The Germans did use the AT-6 in some numbers as advanced trainers, which they had sequestrated from the French in 1940.', u'The German characters were cast from actors out of Munich, including Hannes Messemer and Til Kiwe. Both had their own prisoner of war experiences. Messemer had been captured on the Eastern front by the Soviet army, escaped, and walked hundreds of miles to the German border. Frick served time in an American prison camp in Arizona. He tried to escape seventeen times.', u'For the train sequences, a railroad engine was rented and two condemned cars were purchased and modified to house the camera equipment.

The man was greatly relieved, Goff said, when he learned it was just a movie set.', u'The nationality of a few of the prisoners in the story was changed, emphasizing American, and de-emphasizing Commonwealth and other Allied.', u'The gold medallion Steve McQueen wears throughout the film was a present from his wife.', u'According to John Sturges, the screenplay went through six writers and eleven versions, and was still a work in progress during the actual shooting. ""I\'m not proposing that\'s a good way to make a picture, but it was the right way to make this one,"" he later said.', u""When the Bavaria Studio's backlot proved to be too small, the production team obtained permission from the German government to shoot in a national forest adjoining the studio. After the end of principal photography, the company restored (by reseeding) some 2,000 small pine trees that had been damaged in the course of shooting."", u'During the jump sequence, the crew was warned at the last possible second that the crane was about to slam into a pole. It was withdrawn in the nick of time.', u'Three of the actors, Steve McQueen, James Coburn and Charles Bronson starred together in the movie The Magnificent Seven (1960), also directed by John Sturges and scored by Elmer Bernstein.', u'Steve McQueen and James Garner became friends on this film. They bonded over their love of cars.', u'No American POW\'s particapated in the actual ""great escape ""as suggested in the movie.   Some american POW\'s helped with the digging of tunnel ""Tom"" but they were moved to another camp, seven months earlier before the ""escape"" As the Germans had suspicions something was going on.', u""The was another earlier mass escape attempt from the same compound as the Great Escape. Masterminded by the same 'X organisation', in June 1943 a large party of 26 prisoners escaped while being escorted by fake guards (prisoners disguised as Germans) being taken to another compound for delousing. All got clear of the camp but were all recaptured. Several were also participants of the later Great Escape. Two POWs, Lorne Welch and Walter Morison, attempted to steal an aircraft but were caught before they could start the engine. It was this real event that gave inspiration to certain events in the film. The 2 real officers were sent to Colditz castle and both survived the war."", u""The German National Railroad Bureau cooperated with the production to provide trains and logistics for the railway escape sequences. Platforms were fitted on passenger cars to accommodate huge arc lamps to illuminate the train interiors. On one flat car, a large Chapman crane was set up to swing out over the passenger car and film the jump from the moving train performed by two stuntmen disguised as Garner's and Pleasence's characters. The bureau attached a special radio operator to the crew to alert the train engineer to any potential traffic on the main line. The shooting schedule was squeezed in between actual runs on the rails. The bureau gave the production certain times and lengths of tracks to work on until a passenger train was scheduled to come by; the film train then had to duck onto a siding until the other passed."", u""Steve McQueen's character Hilts was based on amalgamation of several characters, including Major Dave Jones, a flight commander during Doolittle's Raid who made it to Europe and was shot down and captured and Colonel Jerry Sage, who was an OSS agent in the North African desert when he was captured. Col. Sage was able to don a flight jacket and pass as a flier otherwise he would have been executed as a spy. Another inspiration was probably Sqn Ldr Eric Foster who escaped no less than seven times from German prisoner-of-war camps."", u""The motorcycle that Hilts (Steve McQueen) rides is a cosmetically modified Triumph TR6 Trophy. Bud Ekins who actually performs the famous barbed wire leap stunt, was a Triumph dealer. Triumph was McQueen's favorite motorcycle marque. The motorcycle sidecar combination that crashes into a ditch is revealed to be a Triumph motorcycle, too. As is well known, these British motorcycle models were not in existence during the Second World War and their appearance is somewhat incongruous."", u""John Leyton who played Willy, the Tunneler, was one of the most popular UK pop singers in the early '60s. He recorded the title song with lyrics."", u'The Germans routinely confined enemy aviators in Luftwaffe prisons, regardless of which service they had been in. This accounts for the presence of Ashley-Pitt, a Royal Navy pilot, in Luft Stalag III.', u""The hooch-making scene in the film, where the Americans celebrated Independence Day, is believed to be based on the British creating an alcohol distillery for Christmas Day celebrations in 1943. Captain Guy Griffiths, a Royal Marine pilot in Stalag Luft III who produced forged documents for the escape, also produced a comical illustration of the scene which survives to this day. This painting, along with many others, forms the basis for a Special Exhibition on 'Griff' at the Royal Marines Museum (Southsea, England) running from Easter 2010."", u'The motorcycle driven by the character of Virgil Hilts that is used for the fence jump is a 1962 Thunderbird Triumph, which was refurbished to look like a bike 20 years older.', u'The newspaper that Ashley-Pitt (David McCallum) reads on the train is the \'V\xf6lkischer Beobachter\', a real newspaper produced for 25 years by the National Socialist German Workers Party. It served as a propaganda sheet for the Nazis and helped bring Adolf Hitler to power. At its height, it had a circulation of approximately 1.4 million. The headline for the issue seen in the film translates roughly to ""Day after day, the Soviets have high, bloody losses."" Given that the escape in the film occurs in the summer of 1944, this too can be viewed as propaganda. The Nazis had transferred hundreds of thousands of troops to Normandy to stop the Allied advances after D-Day, allowing for the Soviet\'s to launch Operation Bagration on 22 June, which pushed the Nazis back into Poland by the beginning of 13 July and sparked the Warsaw uprising. In all, the Soviet advance caused German losses of approximately 670,000 dead, missing, wounded and sick, including 160,000 captured. Although the date of the escape is unclear, given the green pastures around the Alps that the escapees encounter, one can easily surmise that the newspaper was putting a positive spin on the battles in the east.', u'After two months shooting in the camp, the production moved to the town of Fussen near the Austrian border for post-escape scenes. Because he was already running out of money, John Sturges decided to cut back on his original plan to film in a number of locations. Fussen had all the elements he needed to simulate the various places where the escapees run, including nearby meadowlands to shoot the required motorcycle sequence.', u'Danny says that all he could say in Russian was ""I love you"". Charles Bronson was fluent in Russian and spoke it as a first language from childhood.', u'Steve McQueen held up production because he demanded that the script be rewritten to give his character more to do.', u""John Sturges' assistant Robert E. Relyea was an amateur pilot and offered to fly the plane himself for the sequence in which Hendley and Blythe commandeer a plane for their escape. In one segment he had to simulate the plane losing power and descending over a line of trees. According to Relyea, a farmer in his field saw the plane with its Nazi insignia coming in low over his head and threw his rake at it. Another time Relyea was arrested when he had to put the plane down in a field that happened to belong to a German aviation official. He also piloted the plane in the crash shot, knocking himself unconscious and being taken to the hospital where he woke up later feeling a sharp pain down his back."", u""John Sturges shopped the film for eight years but couldn't get a major studio to bite until United Artists stepped in. Sturges credited the success of The Magnificent Seven (1960) with the eventual funding of the film."", u""MacDonald (Intelligence) is based on George Harsh, a very good friend of Wally Floody (the real Tunnel King). They were both transferred to Belaria before the escape. Harsh was a very interesting character who was from the American south and had joined the RCAF as a tail-gunner. In the 1920s Harsh had committed murder and was sent to jail for life. A medical student, Harsh performed an appendectomy on a dying prisoner and saved his life. The governor of Georgia granted him a pardon and he was set free. After the war, he had personal problems as he was plagued by guilt over the crime he committed as a youth; on top of adjusting to life after fifteen years in captivity (12 years on the Georgia chain gang, followed by three years as POW). On Christmas Eve 1974, he did shoot himself but survived. A stroke soon after left him partially paralyzed. When that happened, Wally Floody and his wife brought him up to their Toronto home and looked after him. He eventually went to live -at his own urging- at the Veteran's Wing at the Sunnybrook Medical Centre. He died in January of 1980."", u'The film was shot on location in a German forest. To make room for the camp set, several trees had to be bulldozed. John Sturges had to show the West German Minister of the Interior his plans and, to get permission to bulldoze, had to promise to plant two seeds for every tree felled when production was over.', u""After viewing the rushes, Steve McQueen decided his part was minor and undeveloped. He was particularly upset that his character virtually disappears from the film for about 30 minutes in the middle so he walked out demanding rewrites. John Sturges admitted the half-hour gap was likely a problem, but with the production already behind schedule due to the heavy rain, he felt he couldn't take time out to do rewrites and rescheduling. James Garner said he and James Coburn got together with McQueen to determine what his specific gripes were. Garner later said it was apparent McQueen wanted to be the hero but didn't want to be seen doing anything overtly heroic that contradicted his character's cool detachment and sardonic demeanor. At the same time, McQueen never really liked his character's calm acquiescence to his time in the cooler or the famous bit with the catcher's mitt and ball. Sturges considered writing the character out of the story altogether, but United Artists informed him they considered McQueen indispensable to the picture's success and would spring for the extra money to hire another writer, Ivan J. Moffitt, to deal with the star's demands. McQueen returned to work."", u'Richard Attenborough was an RAF air gunner/photographer who served in the RAF for three years unlike his character, based on Squadron Leader Roger Bushell who was a Spitfire Pilot in 92 Squadron in the early years of World War Two.', u'Early on in the production, John Sturges began receiving memos from distributor United Artists requesting female roles in the picture. One even suggested having the dying Ashley-Pitt cradled in the lap of a beautiful girl in a low-cut blouse. The studio wanted to cast this bit by having a Miss Prison Camp contest in Munich. Sturges would have none of it.', u'The 3 real POWs to escape were Norwegians Per Bergsland and Jens Muller (who escaped by ship to Sweden after taking a train from Sagan to Stettin via Berlin) and Dutchman Bram van der Stok (who travelled across Europe to Spain)', u""One of the masterminds for the real Great Escape was Wing Commander Harry Day. He isn't directly portrayed in this film, however the book which the film is based on (by Paul Brickhill) correctly tells his story. Arguable his story is the most impressive of the lot, having participated in at least 4 other mass breakout and 2 solo attempts prior to the Great Escape (twice getting free from the camp before recapture). He was one of the first out of the tunnel but was recaptured in Stettin trying to get help to gain passage out of Germany. He was spared execution and sent to Sachsenhausen concerntration camp with 3 other escapees. There they dug another tunnel and escaped with another British officer being held there. It's is widely believed they were the only people ever to survive an escape from that camp. All were recaptured and held in solitary confinement until being used as a hostage at the end of the war. Escaping from his captives he reached allied lines and was instrumental in securing the safe release of the other hostages."", u'Richard Harris was originally cast as Roger Bartlett, but dropped out because filming This Sporting Life (1963) was behind schedule and he was displeased with the diminished role of Big X after script changes had been made.', u'Walter Mirisch originally wanted Burt Lancaster for Hendley and Kirk Douglas for Hilts.', u'Group Captain Ramsey, is largely based on the real Senior British Officer Herbert Massey. Massey was injured when shot down and walked with a pronounced limp which prevented him from the escape attempt. James Donald walks with a limp and uses a walking stick in the film in honour of Massey.', u'James Coburn\'s Australian accent was non-existent, so the movie uses other devices to emphasise his nationality. For example, on entering the workshop, Roger\'s exasperation with Sedgewick follows with: ""Bluey, where the hell is the air pump?"" ""Bluey"" is an affectionate term for a person with red hair, found in Australian slang in the first half of the twentieth century. The consequence of Roger\'s use of the term, though made in support of the character, was too subtle for wider audiences and the credit of ""Louis"" appears for Sedgewick on many lists.', u""Richard Attenborough said many years later working with Steve McQueen on this film was one of the toughest challenges he had ever faced and their on set relationship was not peaceful. McQueen was not combative but he wouldn't hesitate to let anyone know if things were not as he would wish them to be or believed that they ought to be."", u'Richard Attenborough was cast on short notice after the first choice pulled out.', u'The character of von Luger was actually based on Friedrich von Lindeiner-Wildau. As with von Luger, the real commandant was an Oberst (Colonel), a general staff officer, and a holder of the ""Blue Max"" (Pour le Merite) medal. However, while the pictures on the wall of von Luger\'s office are of World War I flying units, von Lindeiner-Wildau earned his Blue Max in the East Africa campaigns in 1905-07 and served as an infantry officer before and during World War I. He retired from the Army in 1919 and only joined the Luftwaffe in 1937 at \'Hermann Goring\'\'s personal invitation.', u'Steve McQueen reportedly rarely mingled with others away from the set, preferring to stay in the chalet he rented for himself and his family and travelling to the set each day in a chauffeur-driven limousine.', u'On entering the workshop, Roger is heard to exclaim: ""Bluey, where the hell is the air pump?"" ""Bluey"" is an Australian slang term for someone with red hair.', u'The film features no main female characters.', u""In the scene following Hilts' theft of a German motorcycle, he rolls into a nearby town, and stopped by a police officer. He tells Hilts something in German, to which Hilts kicks him away and rides off. The officer asked Hilts for identification papers Hilts doesn't have."", u'The barracks interiors were constructed on sound stages at the German studio.', u'There are six different languages spoken or sung in the movie: English, German, French, Russian and one word in Spanish as well as two words of Latin ""Lanius Nubicus"" when Flight Lieutenant Blythe is describing the masked shrike or butcher bird in the forgery scene. There is also a song in a light Scots dialect where Ives and MacDonald are singing ""Wha Hae the 42nd"" in the 4th of July scene just before ""Tom"" is discovered.', u'The filming schedule was changed due to heavy rain, meaning that interiors from the middle portion of the picture were shot first.', u'The uniforms of the camp guards represent a mixture of Luftwaffe branches. The officers and half the guards wear gold-yellow collar patches of air crews, including pilots and ground personnel. Strachwitz, the senior NCO, and the other enlisted guards wear the red collar patches of the anti-aircraft artillery.', u""Ramsey's title, 'S.B.O' stands for Senior British Officer."", u""The scene where Hilts is removing bed boards for tunnel use and Cavendish, not realizing too many boards were removed, comes crashing down through the bunks, is reminiscent of a real incident in Stalag Luft III as described in Paul Brickhill's book upon which this film is based. During a drive to scrounge as many bed boards as possible, Roger Bushell (the real-life prisoner who was portrayed by Richard Attenborough as Roger Bartlett) wanted to set an example and donated all of his boards and convinced his bunk-mate to do likewise.

Because videotape was a relatively primitive medium in the early 1960s, the editing of tape was next to impossible. Thus, each of the six episodes was ""camera-cut"" as in live TV, on a studio sound stage, using a total of four cameras. The requisite multicamera setup of the videotape experiment pretty much precluded location shooting, severely limiting the potential scope of the story-lines, and so the short-lived experiment was ultimately abandoned. The limitations of using videotape (e.g., it could not be edited as cleanly as film and its visual quality was poorer) led the network to switch back to film for the rest of the series, despite the greater cost. The six videotaped episodes were titled: The Twilight Zone: The Lateness of the Hour (1960); The Twilight Zone: Static (1961); The Twilight Zone: The Whole Truth (1961); The Twilight Zone: The Night of the Meek (1960); The Twilight Zone: Twenty Two (1961); The Twilight Zone: Long Distance Call (1961) and then transferred to film for broadcast, which saved the producers about $5,000 per episode.', u'Although the phrase ""Submitted for your approval"" from Rod Serling\'s opening narration has come to be closely identified with the show (and is often used by Serling impressionists), it is actually heard in only three episodes: The Twilight Zone: Cavender Is Coming (1962), The Twilight Zone: In Praise of Pip (1963), and The Twilight Zone: A Kind of a Stopwatch (1963).

After seeing the picture, Akira Kurosawa was so impressed, he sent the American director a ceremonial sword as a gift.', u""James Coburn was a big fan of Seven Samurai (1954) and his favorite role in that film was the character that he ended up playing in the Americanized version. He deliberately incorporated Seiji Miyaguchi's performance as Kyuzo into his performance."", u'Yul Brynner had a major say in casting decisions, including the decision to cast Steve McQueen. He specifically requested that McQueen be cast as Vin Tanner. Brynner later regretted the move since he and McQueen developed a disastrous relationship on set.', u'The ""bandit gang"" hired for Calvera adopted Eli Wallach as one of their own. In the mornings before shooting started, but after Wallach was in costume, he and the group would go riding together for an hour. Additionally, members of the gang insisted on doing the final checks for Wallach\'s horse tack and prop gun before he was allowed to use either.', u'In later years, Yul Brynner and Steve McQueen reconciled. McQueen, dying of cancer, called Brynner to thank him. ""What for?"" queried Brynner. ""You coulda had me kicked off the movie when I rattled you,"" replied McQueen, ""but you let me stay and that picture made me, so thanks"". Brynner told him, ""I am the king and you are the rebel prince: every bit as royal . . . and dangerous to cross."" McQueen said, ""I had to make it up with Yul \'cause without him I wouldn\'t have been in that picture.""', u""According to Eli Wallach's autobiography, Yul Brynner had a major problem with what he perceived as Steve McQueen's trying to upstage him. According to Wallach, McQueen would do things when on screen with Brynner to draw attention to his character. Examples were his shaking of the shotgun shells and taking off his hat to check the sun during the hearse scene and leaning off his horse to dip his hat in the river when the Seven cross into Mexico. Brynner was supposedly so worried about McQueen stealing his limelight in scenes that he hired an assistant to count the number of times McQueen touched his own hat when he [Brynner] was speaking."", u'Yul Brynner (5\'10"") was concerned to make sure he always appeared substantially taller than Steve McQueen (5\'9 1/2""), to the point of making a little mound of earth and standing on it in all their shots together. McQueen, for his part, casually kicked at the mound every time he passed by it.', u""Composer John Williams was a member of the orchestra that recorded Elmer Bernstein's score; he played the piano."", u'Mexican censors required the peasants to always be wearing clean clothes, despite being farmers. This caused a huge delay since it meant that dozens of intentionally dirty costumes had to be thoroughly cleaned before filming could commence.', u""It was Yul Brynner who approached producer Walter Mirisch with the idea of doing a Western adaptation of Akira Kurosawa's classic, Seven Samurai (1954)."", u""The oneupmanship between Yul Brynner and Steve McQueen spread to the other actors, and they all started pulling stunts of their own in order to get the audience's attention. While a lot of the attention-hogging did make it into the finished film, John Sturges was terrified by how quickly he lost control of his cast."", u'Steve McQueen wanted to act in this film but couldn\'t at first because the schedule of his TV series, Wanted: Dead or Alive (1958), wouldn\'t allow it. He crashed a car and while he was ""out sick"", he shot this film.', u'Steve McQueen tried to draw attention from Yul Brynner by taking off his hat to shade his eyes as he looks around just before they drive the hearse to the graveyard and bending down from his saddle to dip water with his hat as the whole crew crosses a stream. Finally Brynner said to him, ""If you don\'t stop that I\'m going to take off my hat, and then no one will look at you for the rest of the film.""', u""Sterling Hayden was originally supposed to play the knife expert, Britt. Hayden dropped out for unknown reasons, so John Sturges sent out an extensive casting call. Robert Vaughn (Lee) recommended his old schoolmate and friend James Coburn for the role. Vaughn and Coburn helped each other get roles throughout the rest of Coburn's life."", u'James Coburn (Britt) and Robert Vaughn (Lee) have only 11 and 16 lines in the entire film respectively. Although they were close friends for almost 50 years, this is their only film together.', u""Pay close attention to Eli Wallach whenever he handles his gun. Whenever he puts the gun back into his holster, he always looks down at it. That was because Wallach wasn't used to drawing the weapon and didn't want to look foolish by missing the holster while putting his gun back, as Wallach would admit in the DVD Documentary."", u'When Vin takes off his hat before Chris starts the horses pulling the hearse, he is actually checking for the presence of wind and from what direction. Although at short distances a coach shotgun is effective, wind is less of a factor than it would be with weapons that had greater range; still, the move was a calculated one by Steve McQueen in his frequent efforts to steal the scene.', u'Eli Wallach wore a silk shirt and sported gold rings and teeth because he ""wanted to show what the bandit did with his loot."" He also used the silver-trimmed saddle that Marlon Brando had used in One-Eyed Jacks (1961).', u'Steve McQueen, James Coburn and Charles Bronson all appeared together again in John Sturges next film The Great Escape (1963). This film had just been released in Germany while the next film was filming, and it was a big hit, so they were all besieged on set by autograph hunters.', u'When filming began in Mexico, problems arose with the local censors, who demanded changes to the ways that the Mexican villagers would be portrayed. Walter Newman, who had written the screenplay, was asked to travel to the location to make the necessary script revisions, but refused. The changes written in by William Roberts were deemed significant enough to merit him a co-writing credit. Newman refused to share the credit, though, and had his name removed from the film entirely.', u'According to a John Sturges interview given in 1990 for the book ""John Sturges, Stories of a Filmmaker"" by Emmanuel Laborie, the music for the movie was to be composed by Dimitri Tiomkin. However, the director had a quarrel with his favorite composer because Sturges did not agree with a song during the opening credits, as he did in Gunfight at the O.K. Corral (1957). Tiomkin was dismissed and replaced by Elmer Bernstein.', u""The horse that Yul Brynner was riding was Pie, the same one that James Stewart rode in all or most of his westerns. It was found while researching Stewart's horse."", u""The film was cast quickly to beat an actor's strike. The only chance of getting the movie made was to assemble the main cast before the strike began, so there was a furious rush to get seven actors together. The cast was just barely assembled in time."", u'Elmer Bernstein, whose score for this movie is one of the best-known ever composed, also wrote the score for the parody of this film, \xa1Three Amigos! (1986).', u'The movie appears to be set sometime in the mid- to late 1880s. However, all of the main characters wear low-slung, Buscadero-style holsters, which were basically unknown before the early 1900s. Actual belt guns in the ""Wild West"" era were worn at the belt line, usually in cross-draw holsters as they were both more comfortable to wear and easier to draw from while mounted on a horse.', u'Yul Brynner (Chris) was the only actor to reprise his role in Return of the Magnificent Seven (1966).', u'Yul Brynner was married on the set; the celebration used many of the same props as the fiesta scene.', u""The name of Charles Bronson's character, Bernardo O'Reilly, is a reference to Chilean independence leader Bernardo O'Higgins, who freed Chile from Spanish rule in the Chilean War of Independence (1810-26) and who was also part Hispanic and part Irish."", u""Screenwriter Walter Newman objected to how John Sturges filmed several of his scenes and became furious when Sturges gave some of Yul Brynner's carefully crafted, character-driven lines to Steve McQueen and Charles Bronson. Livid about it, Newman asked that his name be removed from the credits. However, just a few years later Newman and Sturges reteamed for The Great Escape (1963)."", u'The film was a box-office failure in the United States, but went on to be a smash hit in Europe, and ultimately turned a profit.', u'Chico\'s ""bullfight"" scene was improvised. Someone found a bull and the filmmakers decided to put it in a scene with Horst Buchholz to see if he would take it and run with it.', u'Horst Buchholz (Chico) accidentally shot himself in the leg on set.', u'In the original script the seven gunfighters were much older and veterans of The Civil War. Spencer Tracy was suggested for the role of Chris.', u""James Coburn's friend Robert Vaughn recommended him to director John Sturges for the last remaining lead, the role of Britt. Sturges said he needed a Gary Cooper type of actor, and Vaughn said Coburn was the actor he needed."", u'Yul Brynner studied shooting and the quick-draw method with Rodd Redwing, a Native American actor (he played one of the Gurkha scouts in the Errol Flynn film Objective, Burma! (1945)) and firearms expert who had taught many other Hollywood actors, including co-star Steve McQueen.', u'George Peppard was first considered for the role of Vin. Gene Wilder also auditioned. Peppard would later star in the remake Battle Beyond the Stars (1980).', u""Filming took place in Mexico at a time when the country did not take kindly to Hollywood productions due to the controversy surrounding Vera Cruz (1954). It was agreed that they could shoot there as long as Mexican censors were allowed on set to dictate what could and couldn't be shown, so as to avoid another disaster."", u'Many US Navy ships adopt a theme song based on their name or hull number. The song would be played when leaving port or when completing an underway replenishment. The guided missile destroyer USS Henry B. Wilson (DDG-7) adopted this movie\'s theme. In addition, she had a blue and gold flag that would be broken at the truck when playing the theme song. The flag said, ""Magnificent 7.""', u'The theme song was used for many years for the Marlboro cigarette commercials.', u'Stephen King used the premise of this film as the basis for his fifth Dark Tower novel, ""Wolves of the Calla"".

Brynner refused to draw his gun in the same scene with McQueen, not wanting his character outdrawn."", u""Walter Bernstein did the original adaptation of Akira Kurosawa's film (Seven Samurai (1954)) but it wasn't used. Walter Newman wrote the screenplay that is substantially what you see on screen."", u'According to Robert Vaughan, Steve McQueen complained about the gun Yul Brynner was using in the film, a Colt Peacemaker with an ivory grip. ""You didn\'t notice it?"" McQueen asked. ""It has a fuckin\' pearl handle. He shouldn\'t have a gun like that. It\'s too fuckin\' fancy. Nobody\'s gonna look at anything else with that goddamn gun in the picture"". McQueen also complained about the size of Brynner\'s horse, mostly that it was the biggest. Vaughn replied that he--Vaughn--actually had the biggest horse. ""I don\'t care about yours,"" McQueen told him. ""It\'s Brynner\'s horse I\'m worried about.""', u""The bandit chief's name Calvera resembles calavera, the Spanish word for skull."", u'Clark Gable, Stewart Granger, Glenn Ford and Anthony Franciosa were considered for roles.', u'The title of the movie in the Georgian language means the same as ""Holy Week"", so they used to air the movie in the week prior to Easter.', u""Yul Brynner's killer robot character in Westworld (1973) is physically identical to Chris."", u""The original screenplay was written by Walter Bernstein, but it was later reworked almost beyond recognition by Walter Newman, and Newman's version is what was used for shooting. However, during shooting, rewrites were frequently required on set and Newman was unavailable, so William Roberts was brought in to take his place. When it was suggested that Roberts get a co-credit, Newman was so furious that he demanded that his name be removed from the project completely, so Roberts ended up getting full onscreen credit for a screenplay he only edited."", u""In the original script, as in Seven Samurai (1954), the farmers leave the village to hire mercenaries. This was changed to appease the Mexican censors, who didn't want their country to appear weak or oppressed."", u""The first scene shot was the first part of the six gunfighters' journey to the Mexican village, prior to Chico being brought into the group."", u'According to the ""Making Of"" documentary from the Special Edition DVD version, associate producer Lou Morheim bought the rights to the screenplay for $250. In 2014 money, that is equivalent to less than $8,000.', u""In 1984 producer Walter Mirisch announced a remake of the film as part of his production deal with Universal. Walter Hill was slated to direct and Hill hoped for Robert Duvall to play the role of Chris. However, the poor performance of Hill's Streets of Fire (1984) at the US box office led to the Universal brass cancelling the project."", u'When newspapers started reporting on the altercations on set between Yul Brynner and Steve McQueen, Brynner issued a press statement, declaring, ""I never feud with actors. I feud with studios.""', u'Despite some credit listings, Natividad Vac\xedo plays Miguel, not Tomas, and John A. Alonzo (billed as John Alonso) plays Tomas, not Miguel.', u'During filming, Yul Brynner remarked that Eli Wallach was too benevolent as Calvera.', u'Among the seven actors who played the ""Magnificent Seven"" two of them (Yul Brynner and Horst Buchholz) were born outside USA.', u""George Peppard was originally considered for the role of Vin played by Steve McQueen. George Peppard later went on to play Col. John 'Hannibal' Smith in The A Team (1983), the pilot episode of which was a modern day retelling of this story. Later episodes also retold the story in varying ways and in fact part of the premise of the series was based on The Magnificent Seven."", u""Brad Dexter was cast at the urging of Frank Sinatra, who knew John Sturges well, because Dexter had saved Sinatra's life when the two were swimming off the coast of Hawaii."", u'According to the DVD notes, both John Ireland and Sterling Hayden were approached for the role of Britt.', u'Amazingly, the iconic and enduring score for "" The Magnificent Seven "" did not win the Oscar for Best Original Score. Instead it was won by Ernest Gold for "" Exodus "".', u'Chico is a combination of two characters from (Seven Samurai (1954), Katsushiro and Kikuchiyo.', u'Set reporter Erskine Johnson was convinced that Eli Wallach would upstage the other members of the cast, especially Yul Brynner, and saw him as a threat to their fame and popularity.', u""Eli Wallach and Robert Vaughn's characters are both killed in this film. In real life, however, Wallach and Vaughn were the last surviving members of the main cast. Wallach (born in 1915) is a fine example of irony, for although he played the villain and was older than all the other leads (Brad Dexter was the oldest, born in 1917, and the others were born in 1920, 1921, 1928, 1930, 1932, and Horst Buchholz, the youngest, was born in 1933), he outlived them all, except for Vaughn,"", u""O'Reilly (Charles Bronson) is the last of the seven to die. O'Reilly's counterpart in Seven Samurai (1954), Heihachi Hayashida, is the first of the seven to be killed."", u""John Sturges faced a major problem during filming. The screenplay mentioned which of the Seven died, but in no order (the battle was not choreographed), and without being clear as to how. So Sturges came up with the idea to kill off the dying members of the seven in the order they had been cast, which went as follows: Lee (Robert Vaughn), Harry Luck (Brad Dexter), Bernardo O'Reilly (Charles Bronson), and Britt (James Coburn). Vaughn originally lobbied against dying first (because the character was especially created for him), so Sturges came up with a new solution, and the final death sequence which appears on film went as follows: Harry Luck (Dexter) is shot while riding back into town to join the seven who were holed up in the cantina, Lee (Vaughn) is shot after killing three bandits who were holding several villagers prisoner in a farmhouse, Britt (Coburn) is shot in the chest as he prepares to throw his knife and O'Reilly (Bronson) is wounded several times before this, but finally dies after being shot in the stomach while pushing the children to safety."", u""It's never clearly shown just how many people each member of the Seven killed. However, if one were to look at clear cases of onscreen killings, Vin (Steve McQueen) has the most, while Harry (Brad Dexter) has only one kill."", u'Body count: 55', u'Ironically, though Yul Brynner and Steve McQueen\'s characters didn\'t die in the film, in real life they were the first two among the ""Magnificent Seven"" actors to pass away. McQueen died in 1980 while Brynner in 1985.', u'Robert Vaugn\'s character was the last, among the seven, to be introduced in the film. Coincidentally, in real life, he was the last one among the seven actors who played the original ""Magnificent Seven"" to pass away.', u'Although James Coburn and Charles Bronson are not among the three surviving gunfighters in ""The Magnificent Seven"", they are two of only three prison camp escapees in John Sturges\' next film ""The Great Escape"" (John Leyton, aka Willie the Tunnel King is the third).', u'Eli Wallach had a hand in how Calvera\'s death would be played out. ""Make it simple"", he thought. ""Just let go, relax"". And then it hit him: ""Don\'t focus, just stare, and let your head role to one side."" Sturges liked his idea.', u'Steve McQueen, who played Vin, was the first of the Magnificent Seven to have died. By coincidence, the actor who played his counterpart, Shichiroji (_Daisuke Kat\xf4_) was the first of the Seven Samurai to pass.

On the way the pair was spotted by a truck full of ""federales""--Mexican federal police--who, mistaking them for bandits, stopped them and held them at gunpoint until representatives from the film company showed up to vouch for them.', u'Gary Cooper was unimpressed by the script, pointing out that his character - a former Confederate colonel - would have been fighting for Maximilian instead of Juarez.', u'Gary Cooper was badly hurt when he was struck by fragments from a bridge that had been blown up and the special-effects team had used too much explosives.', u'This film is sometimes called the ""first spaghetti western,"" due to its reputed influence on the Italian directors such as Sergio Leone who popularized the genre.', u'Although portrayed by 54-year-old George Macready, the real Emperor Maximilian I of Mexico was only 34 when he died.', u'For being made in the mid-1950s, this film has a quite fast cutting rate. In 90 minutes of action, it contains about 1130 edits and other transitions. This equates to an average shot length of just under five seconds.', u'Burt Lancaster recalled that Gary Cooper would object to anything in the script that implied his character was anything other than good, and demand it be changed.', u'Burt Lancaster was quite happy to cede top billing to Gary Cooper, knowing that the older actor had more box-office pull than he did.', u'Gary Cooper was taking so much medication that he was impotent for the duration of filming. He also hated working with Sara Montiel, whom he claimed smelled bad and never washed her hair.', u'Eli Wallach has said that the Mexican government was so upset about the negative portrayal of Mexicans in the film that they insisted that the making of The Magnificent Seven (1960) be monitored by censors.', u""One of the first major Hollywood films to be made on location in Mexico. Filmmaking legislation in Mexico meant that a local director had to be involved in the production in some capacity, though he wasn't actually used."", u'Robert Aldrich was so keen on this period of history that he planned to shoot a biopic of Emperor Maximilian. In 1964, he announced that he would begin filming after The Flight of the Phoenix (1965) but it failed to materialise.', u""Produced by Burt Lancaster's own production company for $1.7 million, it went on to become a sizeable hit, grossing over $11 million."", u'The third of four movies Gary Cooper made in Mexico.', u'In his biography, Ernest Borgnine reports that, during the shooting, Burt Lancaster brought his children on the set and all of them laughed at Jack Elam because of his walleyed eye. Elam of course was upset because of this and he had a tough argument against Lancaster in a fierce fist fight.', u'First film released in the ""SuperScope"" wide-screen process. Shot at a conventional 1.37:1 aspect ratio, the film was cropped to 2:1 in post-production, given a CinemaScope-compatible (2x) squeeze and blown up to normal frame height. SuperScope was designed to achieve anamorphic prints from standard flat 35mm negatives. The MGM DVD approximates the 2:1 release print aspect ratio. SuperScope was the fore-runner of ""Super 35"".', u'In her biography ""Playing the Field,"" Mamie Van Doren claimed Burt Lancaster interviewed her for the role of the Countess and attempted to seduce her. She told him she did not wish to get the part in that way and that her mother was waiting for her outside in the car. Lancaster told her she was right and gave her the script to study, and although she officially auditioned, she didn\'t get the part.', u'Closing credits epilogue: ""Vera Cruz"" was filmed entirely in Mexico.', u'The Mexican authorities were appalled at the way their citizens were depicted in the film so any subsequent Hollywood productions had to conform to some strict rules. This explains why in The Magnificent Seven (1960), the locals are all wearing pristine white clothes.', u""One of Robert Aldrich's personal favorites of his films, he particularly enjoyed the fact that it had a hero and an anti-hero."", u""Gary Cooper was 52 at the time of filming, although his character was only supposed to be a couple of years older than Burt Lancaster's character. Joe Erin was meant to be 40, Lancaster's actual age."", u'Screenwriter Borden Chase wrote this with John Wayne in mind.']","[u'USA::25 December 1954', u'Japan::6 April 1955', u'Sweden::18 April 1955', u'West Germany::13 May 1955', u'Spain::31 May 1955 (Madrid)', u'Ireland::24 June 1955', u'Austria::September 1955', u'Italy::4 October 1955', u'Turkey::November 1955', u'Portugal::28 December 1955', u'Finland::21 January 1956', u'Denmark::19 March 1956', u'Australia::5 April 1956', u'Denmark::26 June 1961 (re-release)', u'Austria::September 1961 (re-release)', u'Denmark::17 May 1962 (re-release)', u'Denmark::26 December 1967 (re-release)', u'Italy::23 May 1974 (re-release)', u""France::November 1994 (Festival International du Film d'Amiens)"", u'Germany::23 August 2001 (DVD premiere)', u'France::1 December 2004 (re-release)', u'Italy::11 November 2006 (Turin Film Festival)', u'France::5 September 2009 (Deauville Film Festival)']",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

As the thespian once told biographer Joel Eisner, he\'d regularly go out and see House of Wax during its run. Happily for Price, the requisite 3D glasses could usually conceal his identity in the back of a dimly lit theater. But one night, he decided to make his presence known. At a showing in New York City, Price quietly took a seat behind two teenagers. Right after a particularly frightening scene, he leaned forward and asked ""Did you like it?"" In Price\'s words, ""They went right into orbit!""', u'It must have been easy for Vincent Price to act alarmed in the sequence in which his museum burns down. Right before the shoot, Andr\xe9 De Toth\'s crew set three ""spot fires"" in strategic locations. Then the cameras started rolling and everything went downhill. The team quickly lost control of their fires, which merged into a massive inferno that put a hole in the sound stage roof and singed Price\'s eyebrows. But because the rapidly melting wax mannequins would\'ve been very hard to replace, de Toth kept on filming-even as firemen arrived to help extinguish the flames.', u'The first 3-D color movie ever to be produced by a major American studio. Filming took only 33 days, (from Monday, January 19th, 1953 to Saturday, February 21st, 1953), for its release on Wednesday, April 9th, 1953.', u'While looking for a script for a new Gary Cooper vehicle, Andr\xe9 De Toth came across Mystery of the Wax Museum (1933) and had the idea of redoing it in 3-D. He convinced Jack L. Warner, who gave him a budget of $1,250,000. De Toth finished it in 28 days for $618,000.', u'Warner Brothers\' restoration of ""House of Wax"" for a 3D Blu-ray release cost $300,000. The original negatives were unusable because of water damage and the ""Warnerphonic"" stereo soundtrack no longer exists.', u""The name of Vincent Price's character was changed to Henry Jarrod from Ivan Igor to avoid alienating Russian viewers."", u'The alcoholic sculptor was a heroin addict in the original version of the film, Mystery of the Wax Museum (1933), but that had to be changed for the remake because the Production Code forbade any mention of drug addiction. (Ironically, a character played by Vincent Price had got away with confessing to drug addiction in Dragonwyck (1946), filmed in 1945, eight years before ""House of Wax."")', u'According to the ""Guinness Book of World Records"", while this film is far from being the first 3-D film, nor the first in sound or color, it was the first 3-D film released with a stereophonic soundtrack. While the original stereo tracks are considered lost, it is believed that the ""clamshell case"" Warner Home Video DVD uses the original 4.0 sound mix; as opposed to the ""snapper"" case DVD and Blu-ray release which uses the 2.0 monaural mix-down.', u'Since the film was to be shot in both Technicolor and 3D, great pains were taken to ensure that Vincent Price\'s makeup looked as convincing as possible. The result was a patchwork of hideous burns that shocked audiences-and nauseated a lot of Warner Bros. employees. ""I was banished from the studio commissary,"" Price later recalled. ""This cold shoulder treatment started when I walked [in there] for lunch for the first time and the girl at the register turned green and almost fainted. Then the patrons got up and headed for the door. It was a bad day for business.""', u""Although Bela Lugosi did not appear in the film, he did help promote it. The film's world premiere was held at the Paramount Theater in Los Angeles on April 16, 1953. As a publicity stunt, Lugosi was invited to attend the big event.

In one scene, at the grand opening of the House of Wax, a sort of barker is enticing people to come in, and he actually breaks the ""fourth wall"", talking directly to the movie theatre audience. He is playing with a paddle-ball, hitting it toward the camera, as well as toward the people gathering around in front of the House of Wax. At one point, he is hitting the ball toward the movie audience. Looking directly at ""us"", he says, ""Well, there\'s someone with a bag of popcorn. Close your mouth, it\'s the bag I\'m aiming at, not your tonsils.""', u'Phyllis Kirk tried to turn the film down. Since she was under contract with Warner Bros, Kirk had no choice but to appear in this picture. That didn\'t stop her from complaining about the gig. ""I bitched and moaned and ... [said] that I wasn\'t interested in becoming the Fay Wray of my time,"" Kirk confessed. Another bone of contention was the 3D format, which she regarded as a ""gimmick."" But despite these reservations, Kirk decided that playing ball would be preferable to getting suspended. ""And incidentally, I went on to have a lot of fun making House of Wax,"" she admitted.', u'The trailer was scored by Max Steiner.', u'Joan Weldon and Vera Miles were both contenders for the role of Sue Allen before Phyllis Kirk was chosen.', u""The scene where Paul Picerni is rescued from the guillotine by Frank Lovejoy seconds before the blade came down was filmed in one take, using a real guillotine blade. Picerni and director Andr\xe9 De Toth got into a heated argument when Picerni, on advice from the film's stuntmen, refused to do the scene as too dangerous (a prop man was to hold up the blade off camera and tell the actors when he dropped it so they could yank Picerni away). De Toth threw him off the picture, but several days later, on orders from studio head Jack L. Warner, De Toth recalled him, and had the prop department modify the guillotine to make it less dangerous. After examining the guillotine, Picerni said he would do one take and no more, which is exactly what happened.""]","[u'USA::9 April 1953 (New York City, New York)\n (premiere)', u'USA::16 April 1953 (Los Angeles, California)', u'USA::25 April 1953', u'Canada::1 May 1953 (Toronto)', u'UK::7 May 1953 (London)', u'Brazil::8 May 1953', u'West Germany::22 May 1953', u'Denmark::1 June 1953 (3-D version)', u'Japan::9 June 1953', u'Sweden::10 June 1953', u'France::17 June 1953', u'Austria::July 1953', u'Australia::17 July 1953', u'Portugal::7 October 1953', u'Spain::8 October 1953 (Barcelona)', u'Norway::15 October 1953 (3-D version)', u'Spain::26 October 1953 (Madrid)', u'Italy::29 October 1953', u'Finland::27 November 1953', u'Turkey::January 1954', u'Denmark::5 November 1962 (2-D version)', u'Denmark::23 August 1965 (2-D version)', u'Norway::4 May 1970', u'Belgium::17 July 1970 (Gent)', u'Australia::29 July 1982 (re-release) (3-D version)', u'Sweden::19 November 1982 (re-release)', u'Finland::17 June 2005 (3-D version) (Midnight Sun Film Festival)']",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Sherwood Schwartz, prior to taking the position as head writer on the show, had it written into his contract with CBS that Skelton was under no circumstances allowed to discuss anything about a show\'s script with him before he was given it prior to taping, which often resulted in Skelton not knowing what a sketch was about or even what character he would be playing until shortly before airtime. That\'s why Skelton would often break character in the middle of a skit and turn to the audience and say something like, ""Don\'t blame me, folks, I don\'t write this stuff.""', u'On 11 August 2009 the US Postal Service issued a pane of twenty 44\xa2 commemorative postage stamps honoring early USA television programs.
