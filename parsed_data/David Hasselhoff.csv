The statement was Gemma would never let Tara and Jax be together, and that Gemma would kill her if need be."", u'In seasons 6 and 7 Jax and a few other members wear ""In Memory Of Opie"" patches on the bottom left side of their kuttes', u'The only SAMCRO members that have a proper wake after they are killed are Half Sack (Johnny Lewis) & Opie Winston (Ryan Hurst).', u'The actual Europa Hotel in Belfast (Ireland), site of a major disaster during the Sons\' Irish stopover, was once one of the most bombed sites in Northern Ireland by the IRA during ""The Troubles"".', u'The original ""First 9"" of SAMCRO are as follows:    John ""JT"" Teller: founder, first club president, deceased;  Piermont ""Piney"" Winston: co-founder, deceased;  Lenny ""The Pimp"" Janowitz: co-founder, alive and only surviving founding member, but incarcerated for allegedly killing three ATF agents;  Keith McGee: co-founder, and then president of Belfast chapter, deceased;  Wally Grazer: fifth member, deceased;  Thomas ""Uncle Tom"" Whitney: sixth member, deceased;  Chico Vellenueva: first Hispanic member of SOA and provided them with a liaison between the Mayans and SOA, deceased;  Otto ""Lil\' Killer"" Moran: not to be confused with Otto Delany, deceased;  Clarence ""Clay"" Morrow: last of the First 9 to join, became president after JT Teller, and was succeeded by JT\'s son Jax Teller, deceased.', u'Charlie Hunnam and Katey Sagal are the only actors to appear in all 92 episodes.

Although, he did form an uneasy alliance with SAMCRO for later seasons. Ethan Zobelle, the main villain in season 2, managed to escape the club. However, while Gemma was on the run, a news clip plays while she is at the motel, showing that the plane Zobelle was on had crashed, most likely killing him off screen. Darby was also a villain in the first two seasons, but he reformed his ways and is only seen twice more in seasons 3 and 6, parting on good terms with the club.', u'Kurt Sutter had stated that he never planned to have Walton Goggins or Michael Chiklis on the show, simply because their performances/characters from The Shield (2002) would overshadow any role they had on SoA. Goggins repeatedly requested a guest appearance, to which Sutter finally replied ""The only way I\'ll have you on this show is if you\'ve got tits and a wig."" to which Goggins replied ""...alright let\'s do it!"". As for Chiklis, Sutter decided to give him a small, but significant role in the final two episodes as the man driving the Semi that Jax crashes into, because he thought it would be poetic to have the main character from The Shield literally colliding with the main character from SoA, as both characters were the centerpiece of so much violence and death.', u""In the episode where Gemma and the Sons are at her father's house in Oregon, Tig offhandedly mentions to Gemma, played by Katey Sagal, (who is in hiding as a fugitive due to a federal warrant for her arrest) that in order to go unnoticed maybe she should go redhead for awhile. Gemma then states, disgustedly, that she would rather shave her head than dye it red. This is most likely a tongue-in-cheek reference to Katey Sagal's character Peg Bundy from her show Married with Children who was known for her large bouffant red hair."", u'When the series explores the Sons\' deeper involvement with the IRA and ultimate trip to Belfast, Northern Ireland, the episodes chronicling the chapter\'s period overseas are titled in Irish: ""Lochan Mor"" (Big Pond/Lake) (S3/E8), ""Turas"" (Journey/Tour) (S3/E9), ""F\xedrinne"" (Truth) (S3/E10), ""Bainne"" (Milk) (S3/E11). The theme song ""This Life"", that opens every series episode, features the addition of Irish traditional musical instruments (flutes, tin whistles) for the duration of the Irish stopover. Episode 13 (season 2) is titled ""Na Triobl\xf3id\xed"" which is Irish for ""The Troubles"", a period generally pertaining to the 30-year political/religious unrest in Northern Ireland that ultimately ended with the Good Friday Agreement in 1998.', u'Chief Wayne Unser\'s Dayton Callie name has a hidden meaning... unless you speak German. The word ""Unser"" in German means ""ours"", which lines up with the fact that he was SAMCRO\'s inside man in the Charming police department.', u'In the pilot episode Jax wears a green cover, foreshadowing him wearing the same exact thing to kill Marks in the series finale.', u'Jackson ""Jax"" Teller died without ever knowing that his mother had some form of contribution towards John Teller\'s death.', u""The phone tapping device used by the Federal agents in season 2 is in actuality Pro-Tools software running off a laptop and connected to an M-Box interface.

The rest of the series he wears white sneakers.', u'Jax makes a comment to Wendy in Season 1, saying something along the lines of, ""Don\'t worry, I won\'t go all Adriana on you,"" referencing Drea de Matteo character and final demise in ""The Sopranos"" (1999)_.

That idea was abandoned when Poitier\'s fee was, in Thomas Schlamme\'s words, ""very high"", and John Wells was able to ascertain that Poitier was not interested, when his manager asked Wells to stop calling.', u""The California assembly was adjourned by a San Francisco Democrat for the purposes of mourning the death of Dolores Landingham, President Bartlet's secretary in the first two seasons, when she died in a car accident. Kathryn Joosten lived on. In other words, they mourned the death of a fictional character."", u'The campaign episodes from the sixth season, that were meant to take place in New Hampshire and Iowa, were shot in Dundas, Ontario, and the airport scenes were at the Hamilton International Airport.', u'The drive-up ""West Wing"" entrance most often filmed for the show, is actually a set used to cover a large door to one of the two sound stages used by the production company. It\'s located at the Warner Brothers Studios in Burbank, California, and can be seen from the street by looking in off Forest Lawn Drive (although often obscured by the many trailers used by the show\'s cast members).', u'Semi-regular character reporter Danny Concannon is a Pulitzer Prize winner. Jed Bartlet is a Nobel Laureate in Economics.', u'The show has a strong connection to the Revenge of the Nerds franchise. Bradley Whitford (Josh Lyman) played Roger in Revenge of the Nerds II: Nerds in Paradise (1987). Timothy Busfield (Danny Concannon) was Arnold Poindexter in the first two movies. Ted McGinley (Mark Gottfried) played Stan Gable in the first, third, and fourth movies. James Hong (the Chinese Ambassador) played Snotty in the second movie. John Goodman (President Glenallen Walken) was the football coach in Revenge of the Nerds (1984). James Cromwell (former President Newman) played Mr. Skolnick in all four movies. F. William Parker (Reverend Caldwell) was a policeman in the first movie.', u'In the DVD extras for season four, John Spencer and Stockard Channing both say that in the Abbey-Jed-Leo relationship dynamic, Abbey is (of course) Jed\'s wife, and Leo is Jed\'s mistress. Spencer hastened to add that he meant ""political mistress"", but Channing did not qualify the assessment.', u""The unusual name of the recurring character played by Danica McKellar, Elsie Snuffin, was inspired by the real name of an actress on Aaron Sorkin's first television show, Sports Night (1998). Kayla Blake's real name is Elsie Sniffen."", u'Edward James Olmos was asked to play Judge Mendoza on a semi-regular capacity, and even though he wanted to, he had just been offered the role on American Family (2007), a show he considered important to have on television at the time.', u'Eugene Levy was considered to play Toby Ziegler.', u""Seventeen actors and actresses from Aaron Sorkin's first show Sports Night (1998) appeared in this show, including Joshua Malina, Janel Moloney, Felicity Huffman, Ted McGinley, Lisa Edelstein, John de Lancie, Allen Garfield, and Clark Gregg."", u""Martin Sheen also played the President (albeit in another character's premonition) in The Dead Zone (1983). However, whereas his character in this show is a good man, and benevolent leader, in The Dead Zone (1983), he was a twisted, evil tyrant intent on nuclear war."", u'The theme music for ""Capitol Beat"", the news show hosted by Mark Gottfried (Ted McGinley), is actually the theme music for the UK\'s Independent Television News (ITN)\'s News At Ten and Night Time News bulletin, a genuine and award winning news program. The theme is a short passage taken from a piece by Johnny Pearson, called ""The Awakening"", itself part of a longer composition called ""20th Century Portrait"".', u'Over the course of the series, fifteen different actors and actresses appeared in the main credits: Allison Janney, John Spencer, Martin Sheen, Bradley Whitford, Janel Moloney, Richard Schiff, Dul\xe9 Hill, Rob Lowe, Joshua Malina, Stockard Channing, Mary McCormack, Jimmy Smits, Kristin Chenoweth, Alan Alda, and Moira Kelly.', u'In season one, episode nineteen, ""Let Bartlet Be Bartlet"", during the meeting in the Roosevelt room about gay soldiers in the military, Toby makes his point by sarcastically asking ""What the hell is going on at Lackland Air Force Base?"" This is a reference to the famous quote from A Few Good Men (1992), when Jack Nicholson asks Kiefer Sutherland ""What the hell is going on in Bravo company, Matthew?"" This show, and A Few Good Men, were written by Aaron Sorkin.', u'Martin Sheen (President Josiah Bartlet) is 5\'7"". But in fact, not a single president in the twentieth century has been under 5\'9"" (Harry Truman\'s height). However, the comparison is pointless when speaking about a fictional President on a fictional television show.', u""Annabeth Schott's (Kristin Chenoweth's) resum\xe9 says that she was a valedictorian at Barwood High School, got a B.A. from Business Administration University, and a political science degree from Georgetown University. Her resum\xe9 also says she served as the secretary to a Senator, Executive Assistant to the Assistant Secretary of State, and Assistant to the President of Cultural Affairs at Maryland University."", u'Bradley Whitford was originally cast as Sam. Whitford, who had read for the part of Josh, called Aaron Sorkin and told him ""I\'m not Sam, I\'m Josh!"".', u'James Brolin stated in a recent interview (2015) that he originally signed on to do five episodes, but for reasons never explained to him, his ended up being just two.', u""In season four, episode six, Sam Seaborn (Rob Lowe) visits a Mattress World. As he enters, he holds the door open. The logo on the door is the same color and font as Wayne's World (1992), in which he played Benjamin Oliver."", u'Kylie Tyndall and Keaton Tyndall were set to appear in scenes of an episode filmed at the Los Angeles Public Library. While filming the scene, the sprinklers went off due to the heat caused by the production lights. The scenes were ultimately scrapped from the episode.', u""In April 2006, Executive Producer Lawrence O'Donnell told the New York Times, that until the death of John Spencer (Leo McGarry), the show's writers had planned to have the Republican candidate, Arnold Vinick, win the election, and not the Democrat candidate, Matthew Santos. O'Donnell said that after Spencer's death, the writers decided that it would be too sad for the audience, if Santos lost both his running mate (Leo) and the election at the same time."", u""During the sixth and seventh seasons, Toby's storyline concerns a leak to the press about the existence of a previously secret U.S. military space shuttle. In 2012, seven years after those episodes first aired, the U.S. Air Force admitted to having completed a classified 469-day military mission of a previously secret, unmanned, Boeing-built, reusable X-37B Orbital Test Vehicle. In other words, a secret U.S. military space shuttle."", u""Following the departure of Aaron Sorkin and Thomas Schlamme after season four, Richard Schiff felt that most of the new writers didn't really understand the character of Toby, and would write him just as grumpy, without nuances. Schiff ended up being unhappy with his work on the show, specially disliking Toby's storyline as the leak in the last season."", u'When Rob Lowe announced he would be leaving the show in the fourth season, among the names considered to replace him were Dermot Mulroney, Judd Nelson, Macaulay Culkin, and Jon Cryer. The job eventually went to Joshua Malina, a longtime friend of Aaron Sorkin, who has been in everything Sorkin has written, since he appeared as a member of the ensemble in Sorkin\'s play, ""A Few Good Men.""', u""When President Bartlet's longtime secretary and friend, Mrs. Landingham (Kathryn Joosten) died, her character was replaced by a new secretary, Deborah Fiderer (Lily Tomlin). Joosten's next long-term, recurring role on a television show was on Desperate Housewives (2004). When the producers introduced a sister for Joosten's character, they cast Lily Tomlin in the role."", u""According to an article in The New York Times (October 29, 2008), shortly after then-Illinois State Senator Barack Obama spoke at the 2004 Democratic National Convention, The West Wing (1999) Writer Eli Attie had several long telephone conversations with David Axelrod, a political consultant, who was then working on Obama's U.S. Senate campaign. From those conversations, Attie modeled the character of Matthew Santos after Obama's political and personal life. Like Santos, Obama eventually won his race for the presidency. Likewise, according to an article in The Guardian (November 6, 2008), the character of Josh Lyman was modeled after Representative Rahm Emanuel; on the show, Lyman became President Santos' Chief of Staff, while Obama's first staffing announcement after his 2008 election, was to name Emanuel as his Chief of Staff."", u'This show often reused the same names for different characters over the course of the series. Josh visited two different psychiatrists named ""Stanley;"" A Senator named ""Gianelli"" is mentioned (but never seen) before Ron Silver\'s character Bruno Gianelli becomes a regular character in season three;. Both the regular characters played by Ren\xe9e Estevez and Anna Deavere Smith are named ""Nancy"". In the season two episode, ""Bartlet\'s Third State of the Union"", the (unseen) President of Colombia is named Santos, and later in the series, the U. S. Representative, and eventual President, played by Jimmy Smits, is named Matt Santos. The Secretary of Agriculture, played by Harry Groener, is named Roger Tribbey, and the White House Counsel, played by John Larroquette, is named Lionel Tribbey. Both Donna and C.J. had memorable high school English teachers named ""Molly"", and after a Secret Service Agent named ""Molly"" is killed in the line of duty, while guarding Zoey Bartlet, Toby names his baby daughter ""Molly"", after her.']","[u'USA::22 September 1999', u'Norway::2000', u'Denmark::5 January 2000', u'Iceland::23 February 2000', u'Switzerland::5 September 2000 (French speaking region)', u'Portugal::7 September 2000', u'Israel::27 September 2000', u'Finland::28 September 2000', u'Croatia::2 October 2000', u'Sweden::30 October 2000', u'Australia::28 November 2000', u'UK::18 January 2001', u'Argentina::7 March 2001', u'Estonia::19 March 2001', u'Hungary::4 July 2001', u'France::6 July 2001', u'Turkey::5 December 2001', u'Japan::11 October 2002', u'Spain::13 November 2003', u'Germany::19 May 2008']",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

A shell of K.I.T.T's body was used when filming the transition to Super Pursuit Mode, since large hydraulic rams were needed to articulate the body panels, and there was no room for an engine or running gear in the car."", u'Pontiac, who supplied the Trans Am for the series, found itself swamped with customer requests for black Firebird Trans Ams with T-tops, tan interiors, and red lights on the front bumper, just like the show car.', u""K.I.T.T. has a roving red sensor on the hood, It is not only modelled after the Cylon's roving eye from Battlestar Galactica (1978), but when it shown in a close-up, and is moving, not only does it look like the Cylon eye, but also has the same sound effect of it moving as the Cylon's eye made."", u'The ""jumping car"" was a hollow fiberglass Trans-Am.', u""William Daniels, who did the voice of K.I.T.T., never appeared in the credits during the show's four year run."", u'The ""auto-cruise"" car was a right-hand drive car, so that Hasselhoff could get into the car without cutting the scene (only on the last season).', u'When this show became a hit, and for several years following its cancellation, aftermarket kits were available to add the ""scanner eye"" to consumer Trans-Am cars of appropriate vintage.', u'According to Brandon Tartikoff, the head of programming at NBC during the 1980s, the inspiration for the series came about when NBC executives started complaining about the problems of casting handsome leading men in television series, because many of them couldn\'t act. Tartikoff and his assistant came up with a concept for a television show called, ""The Man of Six Words"". Each show would begin with the leading man getting out of a woman\'s bed and saying, ""Thank you"". Occasionally, throughout the show, the leading man would say, ""Okay"", when receiving orders from his boss. Then he would chase down some villains and say ""Freeze!"" Finally, when the people he had saved from death would thank him, he would say, ""You\'re welcome"". For the rest of the show, the car would do all the talking. Although Tartikoff had meant the pitch to be a joke, the NBC executives liked the idea of a television show about a man with a talking car, and approved it for development.', u'Super Pursuit Mode was introduced as a means of retaining viewers for a fourth season.', u'K.A.R.R. - (Knight Automated Roving Robot) (the evil Trans Am), was the prototype for K.I.T.T. But its system had only been programed for self-preservation, whereas K.I.T.T. is programed to preserve human life, its ""evil twin"" was not. The voice of K.A.R.R. was done by Peter Cullen, who is probably best known as the voice of Optimus Prime of ""The Transformers"", Cullen has also been voice to ""Predator"" and Eeyore of ""Winnie the Pooh"".', u""According to Car & Driver Magazine, K.I.T.T. was originally intended to be a modified Datsun 280ZX, but General Motors' recently introduced F-Body Firebird Trans Am was substituted in pre-production."", u'Much of the fan mail written to the series by younger viewers, was addressed to the name Michael Knight. Some of these letters were accidentally sent to actor Michael Knight, who was emerging as a popular cast member of the daytime drama All My Children (1970). Knight subsequently added his middle initial ""E"" to his screen name to avoid confusion. Interestingly, Michael E. Knight would later marry Catherine Hickland, who played Michael\'s love interest on this show, and was married to David Hasselhoff at the time of the series.', u'The second season saw the extensive use of miniatures provided by Jack Sessums for most of the really impossible stuff like jumping over trains, over helicopters, crashing into Goliath and ""walking on water"". The miniatures of K.I.T.T. were made to 1/8th scale, modified from the existing commercially available Monogram kit of the 1982 Camaro Z-28 to the same scale. Almost everything done involving trains were miniatures built by Sessums and his crew, as it turns out Sessums was a model train enthusiast who had large scale garden railway models already built, and the production crews made a lot of use of these models which for the most part were ready for use. The same model trains were also used in The Fall Guy (1981) and other similar productions of the time.', u'K.I.T.T. was designed by customizer Michael Scheffe. The convertible and Super Pursuit K.I.T.T.s were designed and built by George Barris.', u""K.I.T.T., the Knight Industries Two Thousand, was a customized 1982 Pontiac Trans Am. The 1982 model year was the first year of the third-generation (1982-1992) F-bodies (Chevrolet's Camaro and Pontiac's Firebird share the same platform), and was a complete redesign of the second generation."", u'The ""auto-cruise"" car was driven by a stunt driver inside the driver seat.', u'In season one, episode two, ""Knight of the Phoenix: Part 2"", while K.I.T.T. is driving back from the Sheriff\'s station, the driver is seen hidden in the driver\'s seat. Before Michael gets into the car, the driver\'s arm is visible, cleverly hidden with the upholstery.', u'The narrator of the show\'s opening credits was Richard Basehart, who played dying benefactor Wilton Knight in the pilot episode, ""Knight of the Phoenix: Part 1"".', u'The logo on the side of the semi-trailer of the truck K.I.T.T. is always seen driving into is a ""Knight"" chess piece.', u'Glen A. Larson got the idea for K.I.T.T. and Knight Rider from watching the movie Riemukuplan romuralli (1971).', u""After two successful appearances, producers wanted to do more episodes featuring the truck Goliath and Michael's evil lookalike Garthe Knight. However, David Hasselhoff complained that playing the dual role of Michael and Garthe was too demanding for him."", u'Throughout season one, there is another car that appears regularly besides K.I.T.T. and Devon\'s Mercedes-Benz convertible. It is a red 1974 (or thereabouts) AMC Gremlin X, possibly one of the crew\'s personal vehicles. It was never used in a ""supporting"" role, but only as a vehicular ""extra"", usually driving away from the camera.', u'K.I.T.T. was referred to as a ""Black Trans Am"" in early episodes of the first season, then later simply as a ""Black T-top"" for the rest of the series\' run.', u'Inside the F.L.A.G. (Foundation for Law and Government) truck trailer, in which K.I.T.T parks for repairs, a schematic diagram of a boat can often be seen. It is unknown if this was a concept for K.I.T.T or another F.L.A.G. project, but the design was never physically created in the series.', u'Glen A. Larson borrowed the idea of K.I.T.T.\'s hood mounted scanner from one of his earlier projects, Battlestar Galactica (1978). The Cylon Centurions in that series had an almost identical scanner that functioned as eyes, and Larson adapted the idea for K.I.T.T. Also, originally K.I.T.T. had a square red light on the dashboard that lit up as he spoke. His more familiar ""voice modulator"", with three red lines broken into cells which went up and down as he spoke, was introduced halfway through the first season.', u'In the Grand Theft Auto series of games since the release of Grand Theft Auto III (2001), its been a hugely popular modification to add K.I.T.T. to the game. These fan made mods have become so popular, that in 2016, Grand Theft Auto creators have made an official K.I.T.T. style car modification for Grand Theft Auto V (2013) that can be purchased legally. The car is not a one hundred percent replica of K.I.T.T., and has no A.I. voice, Auto Cruise, or Ski Mode, but does include scanner, turbo boost, and weaponry.', u'The character of Michael Knight was originally known as Michael Long, a cop who is shot in the desert and left for dead. Recovered by Wilton Knight and Devon Miles of Knight Industries, Mr. Long then undergoes reconstructive plastic surgery on his face. He is given a second chance at life, joining the Knight Industries team donning a new face and identity, he is Michael Knight, the Knight Rider. Other aliases include: Mr. Dugan in season one, episode ten, ""Inside Out"".', u'Michael Knight, formerly Vietnam Army Special Forces Intelligence veteran and Police Detective Lieutenant Michael Long, is noted in the credits and in the first season for being a preferred loner. There is never a mention of his family, parents or siblings, throughout the original series four year run.', u'Network executives suggested for season two that K.I.T.T. should fly. The Knight Rider cast and crew rejected the idea, saying it was a stupid idea, of which the show did not need to go in the direction, ruining what Knight Rider was about.', u'The continuation of this show after season four has multiple alternate realities, where the world of Knight Rider ended up, with no connections between the alternate dimensions. The first being what became Knight Rider 2000 (1991), the second being Team Knight Rider (1997), and the third being Knight Rider (2008).', u""K.I.T.T. is always seen driving into the semi-trailer of the Foundation's truck. The logo seen on its side is a knight chess piece."", u'K.I.T.T. is a 1982 Pontiac Firebird Trans Am.', u'Bollywood movie Patthar Ke Phool (1991) used the Knight Rider theme music in a few scenes. This was done without any authorization.', u""An original concept was for K.A.R.R. to be white, based on the opposing Knights' colors of chess. The idea was rejected and left black with an alternate color scanner, due to K.A.R.R. being the same type of car used for K.I.T.T., and would require time and cost-consuming paint jobs. It also did not feel right to the producers, that black was good and white was bad, in the colors of the two opposing vehicles."", u""K.I.T.T.'s voice modulator lights changed after the first season, from a flashing solid red light to the iconic cross style. This was not the only feature to be modified as K.A.R.R. first appeared with a duplicate red scanner and cross, but later was changed to yellow, as well as changing the sides of K.A.R.R. to have a grey stripe from the mid-doors down."", u'K.I.T.T. appeared in a 2013 commercial for AT&T alongside other well known iconic television and movie A.I. robotics, such as Hal from 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) and Robbie The Robot.', u'K.I.T.T. (Knight Industries Two Thousand) was never shown again in the form of the 1982 Pontiac Trans Am in any spin-off series or movies, apart from the 2008 reboot, where his hood and scanner are seen in the shadows of the garage the Knight Industries Three Thousand was created.', u'Knight Rider has had three video game adaptations. Knight Rider (1988) for NES, Knight Rider for PC (2003), and Knight Rider 2 (2004).', u""Quite often the show would use visually similar cars from other famous television shows as villain's vehicles.

Edit: I don't know what the original poster of this trivia entry meant, but Starsky and Hutch rode around in a Ford Gran Torino."", u""Michael's middle name was Arthur.
