(heard twice: the first time after George presses the button to start the plant, and again when George convinces Mr. Spacely to shut down the factory). There\'s even one unedited line of dialogue by Waldo as Judy, which can be heard off-screen.

It is also discovered that the creature is simply being defensive, and is actually a peaceful, logical being. In fact, the creature\'s behavior is beneficial to the miners, and an arrangement is made for the miner\'s and the creature and her babies to partner with the workers, so long as each stays out of the other\'s way.

In total, eighty-two thousand eighty frames of animation were drawn. Including storyboards and concept art. Animation Director Richard Williams estimates that well over one million drawings were done for the movie.', u'Jessica Rabbit was based exactly on four movie femme fatales. Writer Gary K. Wolf had based Jessica primarily on the cartoon character Red, Tex Avery\'s vixen from Red Hot Riding Hood (1943). (In fact, the musical number in Red Hot Riding Hood (1943) is duplicated by Jessica at the Ink and Paint Club.)

Eisner and Silver hated each other from their days at Paramount Pictures in the early 1980s, particularly after the difficulties involved in making 48 Hrs. (1982). Silver shaved off his beard, paid his own expenses, and kept his name out of all initial cast sheets. When Eisner was told, after the movie was complete, who was playing the director, Silver was nearly unrecognizable, he reportedly shrugged and said, ""He was pretty good.""', u'Roger Rabbit is described (design-wise) as having a ""Warners face"", a ""Disney body"", a ""Tex Avery attitude"", Goofy\'s overalls, Mickey Mouse\'s gloves, and Porky Pig\'s bowtie. Richard Williams says he based his Roger color model on the American flag (red overalls, white body, blue tie) so that ""everyone would subliminally like it"".', u'During production, one of the biggest challenges faced by the makers of the film was how to get the cartoon characters to realistically interact with real on-set props. This was ultimately accomplished in two different ways. Certain props (such as Baby Herman\'s cigar or the plates Roger smashes over his head) were moved on-set via motion control machines hooked up to an operator, who would move the objects in exactly the desired manner. Then, in post-production, the character was simply drawn over the machine. The other way of doing it was by using puppeteers. This is most clearly seen in the scene in the ""Ink & Paint Club"". The glasses held by the octopus bartender were in fact being controlled by puppeteers from above, while the trays carried by the penguin waiters were on sticks being controlled from below, the wires and the sticks were simply removed in post-production, and the characters added in.', u'To convince the Disney and Amblin executives that they could make the movie, the filmmakers shot a short test involving Roger bumping into some crates in an alley and then getting picked up by a version of Valiant played by Joe Pantoliano (this test can be seen in the Behind the Ears: The True Story of Roger Rabbit (2003) documentary on the Vista Series DVD).

Seaman admired Chinatown (1974). There were two sequels planned to that film; the first was The Two Jakes (1990), which was eventually made. The second was to be about corruption in Los Angeles when the streetcar system was undermined, and freeways were built to replace them. It was to be called ""Cloverleaf"". Although it is an animated comedy, Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988) pretty much tells the story that would have been covered in the never-filmed, post-noir sequel.', u'Bob Hoskins had to do a lot of his acting in front of a greenscreen, only visualizing the cartoon characters that were added later. In a 1988 interview for Danish television, he said, ""I had to learn to hallucinate to do it. After doing it for six months, for sixteen hours a day, I lost control of it, and sort of had weasels and rabbits popping out of the wall at me."" Hoskins didn\'t take another job for a year.', u'According to Robert Zemeckis, a major brewing company offered to pay to have their name visible on the liquor bottle, from which Roger drinks, early in the film. Zemeckis reminded them that Roger ""turns into a steam whistle"" after taking a shot, but the brewing company reps didn\'t care, apparently figuring that the publicity they would receive would be priceless. Ultimately, this product placement could not be included, as the film was being distributed by Touchstone Pictures (Disney).', u'Eddie Murphy revealed on Inside the Actors Studio (1994) that he turned down the role of Eddie Valiant. He regrets that decision.', u'Kathleen Turner was nine months pregnant when she recorded the voice of Jessica Rabbit.', u'Screenwriters Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman first adapted the Gary K. Wolf novel, ""Who Censored Roger Rabbit?"", in 1981, with a view to making it with up-and-coming Director Robert Zemeckis. However, when Disney viewed Zemeckis\' two feature films, I Wanna Hold Your Hand (1978) and Used Cars (1980), they felt that he wasn\'t talented enough to pull off the movie. But after he made Romancing the Stone (1984) and Back to the Future (1985), Disney reconsidered, and the movie was green-lit.', u'Judge Doom originally had a vulture on his shoulder, and seven weasels accompanying him, rather like the Seven Dwarfs. He ended up only having five. He was also to have a jury of kangaroos, as in ""Kangaroo Court"". These elements were all dropped, because animating these extra characters would be too costly.', u""Felix the Cat's face appears as the masks of tragedy and comedy on the keystone of the entrance to Toontown."", u'Lena Hyena, the hideously ugly toon whom Eddie mistakes for Jessica Rabbit in Toontown, is based on the creation of the same name by artist Basil Wolverton. She was first conceived in 1946 for a contest by Al Capp to depict ""the world\'s ugliest woman"" to be featured in his ""Lil\' Abner"" comic strip.', u'Judge Doom was originally going to have an animated pet vulture that sat on his shoulder, but that idea was dropped in the interest of saving time. However, the vulture later resurfaced with Judge Doom, when a bendable action figure was produced.', u'During production, there was disagreement over the way the Looney Tunes characters should look. Warner Brothers wanted the filmmakers to use the characters as they appeared in their merchandising at the time, while the producers insisted on having the characters looking the way they had looked at the time period where the film is set, the mid to late 1940s. Dummy footage using the modern designs was sent to Warner Brothers for approval, while the animators used the period-appropriate designs in the actual film.', u'An elaborate funeral scene for Marvin Acme, set at the famous Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, was discarded from the shooting script in pre-production. It came complete with Foghorn Leghorn delivering the eulogy, and the Harvey Toons jack-in-the-box logo springing out of Acme\'s casket to the tune of ""Pop Goes the Weasel"", with a giant funeral wreath attached; also in this scene, were many cartoon cameos that were eventually cut, including Casper the Friendly Ghost (who eventually sends everyone fleeing), Tom & Jerry, Screwy Squirrel, Superman and Lois Lane, Felix the Cat, Chip and Dale, Baby Huey, Mighty Mouse, Crusader Rabbit, Little Lulu, Popeye, Olive Oyl, Bluto, Wimpy, Heckle and Jeckle, Cinderella, Alice, the White Rabbit, the Mad Hatter, the March Hare, Winnie the Pooh, Tigger, Piglet, Peter Pan and Wendy, Herman and Catnip, and Little Audrey amongst others.', u'A brief sequence was prepared to test the techniques used to combine live-action with animation. The footage, which showed Eddie Valiant (played by Joe Pantoliano) walking in an alley with Roger Rabbit, touched on all the challenges expected of the production, shading on the cartoon characters, interaction with the live-action cast members and environment, matching with the constantly moving camera, et cetera. The brief, one-minute film, budgeted at one hundred thousand dollars, convinced the filmmakers that the effects could create the illusion of cartoons and live cast members occupying the same reality.', u'The crowd scenes at the beginning of the Toontown sequence consist mostly of animation from previous Disney films. (Re-using animation was a common practice for Disney up until the early 1990s.)', u'Before he was the official voice of Goofy, Bill Farmer had his first job as a voice over artist singing ensemble for the closing song, ""Smile, Darn Ya, Smile!"". He snuck in the voice of Goofy during this song.', u'A prequel with the working title ""Toon Platoon"" never got out of the developmental stage.', u'In the documentary Behind the Ears: The True Story of Roger Rabbit (2003), Bob Hoskins refers (jokingly) to Charles Fleischer as ""completely nuts"". This is likely due to Fleischer\'s insistence upon wearing a Roger Rabbit suit while voicing the character live on the set, despite reminders that he would never be on-camera himself.', u""Robert Zemeckis wanted to use the Robert Clampett version of Daffy Duck, but Chuck Jones wanted to use his version of the character, and had personally disliked Clampett. Zemeckis had his way, and this was one of the main factors in Jones' stated distaste for the film."", u'To create the animation, over eighty-five thousand hand-inked and painted cels were created and composited with the live-action backdrops, live-action characters, and hand-animated tone mattes (shading), and cast shadows using optical film printers. No computer animation was used in creating the animations. Some scenes involved up to one hundred individual film elements. Any live-action that had to be later composited was shot in VistaVision to take advantage of the double-area frame of the horizontal 35mm format. The finished film thus does not suffer from the increased grain that plagued previous live-action and animation combos, such as Mary Poppins (1964).', u'The photograph that Eddie takes of Marvin Acme and Jessica playing ""patty-cake"" was created during pre-production, and features an earlier design of Jessica, than the one that is used in the final character animation. The one shot that was re-done to incorporate the new Jessica design, was the insert shot of the picture after it is first developed.', u'Wallace Shawn was considered for the role of Eddie Valiant.', u""The film's original budget was projected at fifty million dollars, which Walt Disney Productions felt was too expensive. The film was finally green-lit when the budget decreased to thirty million dollars. However, when the film's shooting schedule lasted longer than originally expected, the budget escalated until it reached seventy million dollars."", u'Four phrases appear in this film and Zemeckis\' previous film, Back to the Future (1985): ""Didn\'t hear you come in"", ""You\'re a sight for sore eyes"", ""I\'m gonna ram him"", and (referring to a piece of land) ""As far as the eye can see"". The latter was said in both films by Christopher Lloyd (Judge Doom).', u""Originally, when Lena Hyena caught Eddie in her arms, as she kissed him, she was to stick her tongue in his ear and it would come out through the other ear, it was cut, because they didn't want too many cartoonish things happening to him."", u'Robin Williams was considered for the role of Judge Doom.', u'The bottle of chili sauce falling in the opening cartoon had to be re-animated several times, as British animators used the UK spelling ""chilli"".', u'Exteriors of the Maroon Cartoon Studios were shot at Ren-Mar Studios in Hollywood, California, formerly the home of Desilu Productions.', u'Richard Williams fell in love with the character of (""adult"") Baby Herman, and insisted on animating pratically every frame of this character himself.', u'Given the extraordinary process of making this film, shooting the live-action first, then the animation, which took twice as long, there were little-to-no options in the editing of the final composite. This, coupled with the fact that animation could not begin until all of the dialogue was recorded, practically meant finishing the film before it was finished. This also ruled out alternate takes or re-shoots, since the animation for alternate scenes would have been too expensive, and the animation had already been completed for any scenes that the filmmakers might have wanted to film again. As such, cutting even part of a scene for timing, meant that the entire scene had to be taken out, animation and all.', u'A list of the classic cartoon cameos in the film (which is supposed to be set in 1947, though quite a few post-1947 characters appear), grouped by studio: Disney: Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Pluto, Donald Duck, Goofy, Pegleg Pete, Horace Horsecollar, Clarabell Cow, the merry dwarfs from The Merry Dwarfs (1929), the flowers and trees from Flowers and Trees (1932), the Three Little Pigs and the Big Bad Wolf from Three Little Pigs (1933), Peter Pig from The Wise Little Hen (1934), Toby Tortoise, Max Hare, and the girl bunnies from The Tortoise and the Hare (1935), Mickey\'s orphans from Orphan\'s Benefit (1934), Little Red Riding Hood from The Big Bad Wolf (1934), Jenny Wren from Who Killed Cock Robin?

Chuck Jones, in particular, who worked on the film, ended up loathing the final product. He called it an obnoxious, witless misunderstanding of the old cartoons it set out to honor, and he even accused Robert Zemeckis of robbing Richard Williams of any creative input, and for apparently ruining the piano sequence that he and Williams had planned together. Cartoon historian Michael Barrier derided the animation direction as ""disastrous"", and Frank Thomas of Disney\'s Nine Old Men was strongly disappointed in Richard Williams\' failure to have any actual pathos come from the main character himself. John Kricfalusi has also not spoken highly of it, thinking that it had ""great animators"" but was ""misdirected"", ""filled with takes and zany movement, but no character or wit.""', u'Unusual for an optical effects-heavy production of the 1980s, this film used no matte paintings.

The castle in ""Hamlet"" was Elsinore. The heir to Elsinore\'s father was murdered by her uncle, who then comes to her as a ghost. In Hamlet, the uncle\'s name was Claudius, and in the movie he is named Claude.', u'Among many others, the ""If I didn\'t have puke breath, I\'d kiss you."" line was improvised.', u'The role of Brewmeister Smith was written with Max von Sydow in mind. But Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas thought actually enlisting him would be impossible. It turns out that Freddie Fields, then-president of MGM had just produced Victory (1981), which starred von Sydow. So he sent the esteemed actor the script. Instead of hashing it out with Fields, von Sydow ran it by his son, who was a huge SCTV (1976) fan and encouraged his father to take the role.', u'Before filming, all of the major breweries wanted the McKenzie brothers to appear in beer advertisements. The filmmakers had the promise of Molson\'s Brewery, but once the brewery found out that there was a joke in the film about putting a mouse in a beer bottle so that a complaint can be made in order to get free beer, they distanced themselves from the film. The filmmakers were also banned from filming in a Brewers Retail store, and from using the name ""Brewers Retail"". They ended up building a replica of the store at a cost of more than $45,000, and calling it ""The Beer Store"". Ironically, Brewers Retail later changed the name of its stores to ""The Beer Store"", and they continue to operate under that name.', u'At one point, Bob says, ""He saw Jedi 17 times, eh!"" What isn\'t obvious now, is that Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983) opened in May 1983, while production of ""Strange Brew"" had wrapped five months earlier, in December 1982 despite the film taking place in 1984. The McKenzie couldn\'t refer to it by its full title, since the ""Revenge""/""Return"" issue was still up in the air while they were filming.', u""Rick Moranis' feature film debut."", u'A sequel to the film, entitled Home Brew, was planned for production in 1999 when financing fell through at the last minute. Co-written by Dave Thomas and Paul Flaherty, Flaherty was also going to direct, and Dan Aykroyd was on board to play the part of friend Rick Ripple. Principal photography was to begin on July 19, 1999 in Toronto. At one point, Todd McFarlane was to step in as executive producer to revive financing for the film, but never followed through.The plot, according to a Maple Palm release, would feature Bob and Doug, now working as garbage men, being convinced by a fast talking insurance salesman (Aykroyd) to get into the microbrewing business.', u'While not a direct novelization, a book shaped like Bob and Doug\'s ubiquitous beer bottles was published as a promotional tie-in for the movie. The book touted its ""ingredients"" as ""A mellow blend of choice cartoon tidbits and the finest photo-snippets aged in goatskin bags."" It also featured a fake library card insert with the signatures of famous Canadians who had allegedly checked the book out, including hockey player Bobby Hull and author Margaret Atwood. Being only available for a short time, the book is currently out of print.', u'The film was made following the success of the Bob and Doug comedy album The Great White North and fellow SCTV (1976) castmember John Candy starring in Berserk - raivop\xe4\xe4 (1983).', u'Mel Blanc did the voice of Barney Rubble in The Flintstones (1960) and Rick Moranis played him in the live-action film The Flintstones (1994). They both star together in this film.', u'Originally, Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas were not going to direct or write the film but ended up doing both with the guidance of executive producer Jack Grossberg, who had produced films by Mel Brooks and Woody Allen. They were subsequently given a budget of $5 million.', u'The name of the brewery in this film is Elsinore Brewery. Max von Sydow, who played the Brewmeister in this movie, was also in the film The Seventh Seal (1957). In that film he and his squire were heading towards the village of Elsinore, but decided not to because the plague was there.', u'Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas hired Steve De Jarnatt to write the first draft. Initially, Thomas told De Jarnatt that he wanted to base the film\'s story on Hamlet but he ended up being too faithful to the play and was told be more creative with the parallels to it. Moranis and Thomas\' agents sent the script to various Hollywood studios and a few days later they had a deal with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer based not on the script but on record sales, ""the breakout potential, and the fact that it was being advertised on a television show"", Thomas remembers. They were unhappy with the script because Bob and Doug were improvised characters done in their ""comic voices"" and they felt that nobody but themselves could write for these characters. Thomas began rewriting the script without Moranis who was now uncertain about doing the film. After working on the first 50 pages, Moranis took a look at what Thomas had done and they worked together rewriting it. However, they were not sure just how much they could legally change and did most of the changes in the first third of the script, including the addition of Bob and Doug\'s science fiction film, Mutants of 2051 A.D., Bob and Doug watching it in a movie theater, and causing a riot. Thomas remembers that the script was ""far more bizarre and conceptual in the beginning ... if we had been able to rewrite the whole thing, we would have made the whole thing like that"".', u'The emergency vehicles used during filming were all real Metropolitan Toronto Police squad cars.

The first season was based on Earth and the second was based aboard a deep space exploration vessel. The primary villains in the first season, the Draconians, are never seen in the second season and neither is Buck\'s friend and mentor Dr. Huer, and Hawk (a ""Mr. Spock"" type character) is added as Buck\'s sidekick.', u'Was originally intended to air as a series of two-hour television movies but NBC opted for a weekly series instead. This accounts for the number of two-part episodes that aired during the first season.', u""In the United Kingdom, the series was shown by ITV beginning on 30 August 1980, the same date that the BBC began screening season 18 of their long-running series Doctor Who (1963). With both series in the same Saturday early evening slot, Buck Rogers trounced Doctor Who which saw its ratings fall from a series high of 16.1 million viewers the season before to a low of 3.7 million viewers in November 1980, the lowest ratings in the programme's history at that time. As a similar effect had occurred three years earlier when ITV screened Man from Atlantis (1977), this prompted the BBC to move Doctor Who to a weekday evening slot for its following season, even though Buck Rogers had already been canceled by that time."", u'While working on this series, Mel Blanc provided voices for the parody Duck Dodgers and the Return of the 24\xbdth Century (1980).', u'The Earth Starfighter seen on the series was designed by Ralph McQuarrie and was actually one of his original designs for the Colonial Viper on Battlestar Galactica (1978). When Galactica producers went with another design for the Viper, this design resurfaced on Buck Rogers as the Starfighter.', u""Buck's full name is William Anthony Rogers."", u'Buster Crabbe, who played Brigadier Gordon (aka Flash Gordon) in a first-season episode, originated the character of Buck Rogers onscreen. As they fly into battle, Gordon tells Rogers ""I\'ve been doing this since before you were born"". When Buck, at 500-plus years old, asks ""You think so?"", Gordon\'s answer is a confident ""Young man, I *know* so"".', u'Written on the side of the spaceship Searcher (from Season Two) is ""Per adua ad astra"" , which is a misspelling of ""Per ardua ad astra"" (Through adversity to the stars), the motto for the British Royal Air Force (\'ardua\' is the plural of \'arduus\', meaning \'the steep place\', so the phrase could also mean ""Past the summit to the stars"").', u'Buck\'s space shuttle is called ""Ranger 3"" by the narrator. In real life, NASA\'s Ranger Program ended in the 1960s, and Ranger 3 was a 1962 lunar probe which missed the moon and was lost in space.', u'Henry Silva played Kane in the two-hour pilot episode ""Awakening"", which was released theatrically. However, Silva was unavailable to take part in the weekly series and so Michael Ansara was cast in the role of Kane for subsequent episodes. The change had a subtle effect on Kane\'s relationship with Princess Ardala. In ""Awakening"", there is a flirtatious quality to some of Ardala\'s banter with Kane, such as when she asks if Kane desires ""Me, or my throne?"" and when she pointedly tells Kane that Buck Rogers ""wouldn\'t have been necessary if you were more of a man."" However, this flirtatious banter disappears when Ansara assumed the role, as the relationship between the two becomes more businesslike, notably in the episode ""Ardala Returns"" where Ardala repeatedly expresses doubt about Kane\'s Zygot robot duplicates of Buck Rogers and at one point she angrily orders Kane to sit down.', u""The series used footage of the British and French pavilions at Expo '67 in Canada to represent the futuristic buildings such as Dr. Huer's office tower and Buck's apartment building."", u'Before Erin Gray agreed to return to play the role of Wilma Deering from the film, Juanin Clay was considered to play the role. She later guest starred as Marla Landers, a character very similar to Wilma Deering.', u'The series was revamped for the second season to give it a more serious tone, a move largely pushed by Gil Gerard. Despite the series rating success during the first season, Gerard was displeased with its light, tongue-in-cheek tone, and frequently clashed with producers over content. Gerard was so disappointed that in an interview with Starlog magazine, he confessed he hoped the series would be canceled after the first season.', u'Johnny Harris arranged the opening theme music which was composed by Stu Phillips. The first 45 seconds where Buck is spinning is an original Johnny Harris composition up until Phillips main theme starts.', u'The robot Crichton is named after the American Sci-Fi author Michael Crichton.', u'Food in the 25th century were food disks of protein nutrients as told in the storyline that food is grown on vistula would be plausable as if nuclear war did indeed destroyed cities and countries, the soil and land would be irradiated for centuries making for an accurate portrayel of real life nuclear war aftermath', u""Paul Peters designed the two-hour NBC film pilot, and is credited as Production Designer. MCA-Universal released the pilot as a summer film event anticipating popular (young to mid age male) audience reception; expecting the film to build a television viewing audience when the production started airing on NBC's Fall 1979 TV schedule. Universal art department's policy was to assign alternating design teams to Universal Studio TV episodic series production schedules. After the completion of the two-hour pilot, Paul Peters functioned as the supervising Production Designer over two alternating Art Director/Assistant Art Director/Set Decorator/Special Effects Supervisors/and Prop Master teams. Paul supervised the following four filmed episodes. Bill DeCinces (Universal Art Department Director) moved Paul Peters to another film project. Fred Luff had been team one's Art Director with Bill Talifero as his Assistant A.D. Bill Camden was team two's Art Director with Bonnie Scott as his Assistant A.D. With Paul Peters departure, Fred Luff became the Supervising Art Director, adding Hub Braden to head his team with Bill Talifaro as Braden's Assistant A.D. With the exception of Bill Talifaro, all of these art directors had worked together previously at NBC Burbank Color Television Tape Studios, associated with each other on shared and related television specials, game shows, syndicated programming, dramatic daily series, commercials, and network holiday events (Pasadena Rose Parade, sporting event and news specials).""]","[u'Mexico::16 August 1979', u'USA::20 September 1979', u'UK::30 August 1980', u'Sweden::25 June 1983', u'France::7 July 1984', u'Netherlands::5 October 1985', u'Netherlands::12 October 1985', u'West Germany::4 September 1990 (part 1)', u'West Germany::11 September 1990 (part 2)']",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

A speedometer was temporarily attached to the wheelchair to check its ""top speed"". The top speed was apparently never determined, due in part to the chair\'s incredible acceleration and due to the ""apprehension"" of stunt men on the set to drive the special wheelchair at full throttle, because it ""reportedly"" reached 60 miles per hour and was still accelerating.']",[u'USA::21 May 1980'],0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The film made over $21 million in North America alone.', u'Originally, Twiki was just going to make unintelligible electronic noises (the ""biddi-biddi-biddi"" sound) and Dr. Theopolis was to act as his translator. However, this was deemed to be too similar to R2-D2 and C-3PO from Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977) and so Twiki was given a voice of his own.', u'Why there are two different Tigermen in the original film? According to costume designer Jean-Pierre Dorleac, it\'s because the fight scene between Tigerman and Buck was added later, after the original production had already wrapped. When they tried to call the actor who had played Tigerman earlier in the film back (he had been ""discovered"" for the role on the Universal Studios back lot tour), they could not find him! So they had to replace him with a lookalike (frankly, who did not).', u""To cut costs, some footage and various props were used from Glen A. Larson's series Battlestar Galactica (1978). Even some of the concept designs from Galactica were used. The Terran starfighters on Buck Rogers were originally designed as the Colonial Vipers for Galactica, but Larson had opted for a design closer the X-Wing fighters from Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977). Larson then employed the unused designs for Buck Rogers."", u'The Buck Rogers theme features lyrics that were not used for the television series. This has been noted that these lyrics seem to parallel plot developments in the later Buck Rogers-inspired series Farscape (1999).', u'To make Buck appear frozen in his space shuttle, he was sprayed all over with an ordinary dry shampoo. Because of this, he could not open his eyes or move, so while he was waiting for them to shoot the scene, he supposedly fell asleep.', u'The space dogfights were choreographed with the aid of a Hewlett-Packard ""45"" computer', u'Catherine Bach was considered for the role of Princess Ardala.', u'Kane\'s backstory was that he was a former student of Doctor Huer\'s who defected to the Draconians and to act as consort/advisor for Princess Ardala, the chief antagonist of the series. In the original movie serial Buck Rogers (1939), ""Killer Kane"" (as he was known) is actually a powerful gangster from Earth and is the chief antagonist of the story. Princess Ardala was not featured in the 1939 movie serial.', u""The British and French pavilions from Expo '67 in Canada, and the Westin Bonaventure Hotel in downtown Los Angeles were all part of the New Chicago skyline."", u""Originally, Buck was to have been put on trial, found guilty and banished to Anarchia, along with Twiki and Theo, until Wilma comes looking for him with an idea that might prove his innocence. In the finished film, after reshoots, the story was restructured so that Buck chooses to explore Anarchia (with Twiki and Theo tagging along), until Wilma arrives to bring him back, then he's put on trial, found guilty and sentenced to be terminated, until Wilma presents him with the opportunity to prove his innocence. Since these changes came late in production, there were several tie-in publications released (including the novelization and comic adaptation) which followed the original sequence of events."", u""Buck's full name is William Anthony Rogers, as revealed on Buck Rogers in the 25th Century: Happy Birthday, Buck (1980)."", u'Douglas Rain (the voice of HAL in 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)) was the first choice to do the voice of Dr. Theopolis.', u'The ruined City of Chicago called Anarchia was shot on the back lot of MGM Studios.', u""The original script contained a subplot in which Counselor Apol - the chief prosecuting computer at Buck's trial - is discovered to be in league with Princess Ardala."", u'In the original ending for this film, Buck and Wilma celebrate the victory over Ardala and Kane by dancing to the tune of ""Chicago, Chicago, that toddling town"".

Wright painted all of the paintings used to introduce each story.', u'Conceived as an updating of the ""Twilight Zone"" concept, Serling reportedly began planning the series soon after ""Twilight Zone"" was canceled in 1964.', u'John Astin appeared in three separate episodes of Night Gallery (1969). During each episode, his character was killed, and during two episodes, his character found himself in Hell. Also directed three episodes of the show.', u'Two segments, and possibly a third, were directed by a young Steven Spielberg. According to the book, ""Rod Serling\'s Night Gallery: An After Hours Tour"", Spielberg was scheduled to direct the 1971 vignette ""A Matter of Semantics"" starring Cesar Romero. Those involved with the production are unclear in their memory as to whether Spielberg actually directed the piece, which was ultimately credited to Jack Laird. At least one actor involved in the 2-minute mini-episode recalls a director who more closely fits Spielberg\'s description than Laird\'s. Beginning with the second season, and despite Rod Serling\'s objections, the producers began to insert brief 1-3 minute ""blackout comedy"" sketches in between main segments of some episodes, usually when an episode was running short. The merits of these brief vignettes remain controversial among Night Gallery (1969) fans to this day.', u'Sculptors Logan Elston and Phil Vanderlei did all of the Night Gallery (1969) sculptures.', u'One year before the debut of the TV series Kung Fu (1972), David Carradine and Radames Pera, who each played the ""Kung Fu"" character of Kwai Chang Caine at different ages throughout that series, appeared in the same episode of ""Night Gallery"", though in different segments. Carradine appeared in ""Phantom Farmhouse"" (episode 2.16) and Pera appeared in ""Silent Snow, Secret Snow"" (episode 2.17).', u'Episodes from the hour long The Sixth Sense (1972), starring Gary Collins, were edited down into half-hours, and added to the Night Gallery syndication package. Studios find it easier to sell programs in syndication when they have more episodes in the package, as local stations know audiences are more likely to grow tired of a program is the same episodes are repeated over and over again within a short period of time. Adding the edited Sixth Sense programs made syndicating the program easier.', u'The syndication version of the series took individual segments from the original hour long program and worked them into half-hour episodes. This sometimes meant editing out footage from original episodes that ran longer than a half hour, or adding footage to those that originally were shorter than a half hour.', u""The set used by Rod Serling to introduce each story contained both paintings and sculptures. Only paintings were used, however, to illustrate a story's title."", u""Rod Serling had originally conceived of a show like Night Gallery when he was still working on The Twilight Zone. He had originally wanted to change the stories to be shown during the final season from fantasy to horror (the genre he preferred), but CBS adamantly refused to agree to it. Unfortunately for Serling, on Night Gallery he did not have the same kind of control over the program like he did on Twilight Zone, as he was just the host and occasional story contributor). Serling frequently clashed with the show's producer of the quality of stories shown on the program."", u""The 1970-1971 television series, Four-In-One (1970), rotated four separate shows: Night Gallery (1969), McCloud (1970), San Francisco International Airport (1970) and The Psychiatrist (1970). The last two programs were canceled after that season; McCloud became part of the new Mystery Movie series (along with Columbo, and McMillan & Wife) and Night Gallery was given it's own time slot.""]","[u'USA::8 November 1969', u'Sweden::24 July 1970', u'USA::16 December 1970', u'UK::18 April 1973']",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The mother, Wilma & daughter, Pebbles, are 100% redheads for sure. Their son to-be, appeared in an early press release book, and in a Little Golden Book, ""The Flintstones"". However, this was changed from the cast before the series went into production.

When the series went into syndication, a standardized set of opening and closing credits was used for most episodes in order to remove references to first season sponsor Winston cigarettes, thus all episodes now begin with ""Meet the Flintstones"", in the Opening Credits. Although ""Meet the Flintstones"" was not used as the show\'s theme until season three\'s debut, The Flintstones: Dino Goes Hollyrock (1962), it was the theme song for the final 106 episodes, of the series\' run.

Jackie Gleason was heavily tempted to sue the Hanna & Barbera studio, over The Flintstones (1960)\'s resemblances, (in animation) to The Honeymooners (1955) until friends pointed out to him that it might be bad for his current acting career image and heavily tarnish his acting career (from then on), if he became known as ""the man who killed Fred Flintstone"" & deeply weaken his popularity & acting career, with a negative note. If Gleason did go through,with his extremely heavy thought & temptation of suing Hanna & Barbera, he most likely would have been given the role of Sheriff, Buford T. Justice, in 1977\'s top theatrical comedy role in theatrical movies, Smokey and the Bandit (1977) & its sequel Smokey and the Bandit II (1980). A Warner Brothers cartoon, Wild Wild World (1960) was also been cited as an additional influence, as a ""trouble maker"".', u'The Flintstones (1960) was at one time the longest-running prime-time animation cartoon weekly series. The Simpsons (1989) took their record over, in 1997. However, it is still the longest Hanna & Barbera studio production held, their studio record lasted for 30 years & has been in second place, for 18+ years. 30 years at first place & 18+ years at second place = 48 years, at-least.', u'Pebbles Flintstone was born at the Rockville Hospital on February 22nd, 10,000 B.

(Pebble + s = Pebbles). Pebbles\' first name originated from phrase, ""Chip off the old Block"" & 1 s was added to former maiden & damsel, Wilma Pebble\'s name as her birth occurred, before the series started. There is no doubt, that their red-headed daughter\'s seven locks of dark red hair, was from Wilma\'s dark red hair genes & her family side, (before maiden, Wilma met and married bachelor, Fred Flintstone).

This was because co-directors, William Hanna and Joseph Barbera felt that Fred and Barney\'s quarreling throughout a majority of their 167 episodes and would not a good way to begin their new series. Therefore, the third episode of the series The Flintstones: The Flintstone Flyer (1960) was the first one to air, following The Flintstones: The Flagstones (1960).

The contest was to pick Pebbles\' birth weight, and indeed the winner, a Florida butcher, did receive a round the world trip plus $2,000 spending cash.

Kennedy, shortly before the shot was filmed.', u'The ship\'s name, S.S. Minnow, was not named for the fish but rather for Newton Minow, head of the Federal Communications Commission in 1961. Minow was the one who called television ""America\'s vast wasteland"". Sherwood Schwartz did not care for Minow so he named the soon-to-be shipwrecked ship after him, though he later said that Minow actually enjoyed the joke and that the two eventually exchanged regular friendly correspondence.', u'Alan Hale Jr. had a tendency to address people as ""little buddy"". Because of this, ""little buddy"" became the Skipper\'s signature term of affection for Gilligan. It is now widely used by fans as a nickname for Bob Denver.', u'Alan Hale Jr. was on location in Utah filming a movie when he got a call to come back to Los Angeles to do a test for the series. He rode a horse to a nearby highway, hitchhiked to Las Vegas and flew to L.A. to test with Bob Denver.', u'Sherwood Schwartz said he had a first name for Gilligan if the need to use it ever arose: Willie. This name is never spoken on screen, so it seems as if Gilligan only has one name as with celebrities such as Homer or Cher.', u'In the backstory, The Professor had taken the three-hour tour to relax before he began writing a book, ""Fun with Ferns"".', u'In the first-season credits, Russell Johnson and Dawn Wells were relegated to being simply ""the rest"". That changed in the second season when Bob Denver demanded that they be given an equal share in the credits, thus changing the lyrics to ""The Professor and Mary Ann"". Sherwood Schwartz, who composed both themes, has said it didn\'t occur to him the Professor and Mary Ann would turn into prominent characters.', u'The first season had the cast using cups that were made from real coconuts. However, they found that the cups were porous and soaked through like they were sweating. Thus in the later seasons, the coconut cups were ceramic replicas.', u'""The radio"" seen in virtually every episode was a Packard-Bell AM Radio, Model AR-851. The small silver handle and telescoping antenna were added by the prop department (despite the fact that AM radios do not use telescoping antennas). The antenna was likely added to lend credence to the castaways\' ability to pick up radio signals so far from civilization.', u'The three-man folk singing group The Wellingtons sang the theme song for the first season, but were replaced by a similar sounding group, The Eligibles, for the following seasons. The Wellingtons (plus one) also portrayed ""The Mosquitoes"" in a classic episode of the series: Gilligan\'s Island: Don\'t Bug the Mosquitoes (1965).', u""As the show progressed, producers planned to introduce a new character--a pet dinosaur--but decided against it because of the cost of special effects. The character, however, was incorporated into the animated Gilligan's Planet (1982)."", u'The lagoon set was the same one used to make Creature from the Black Lagoon (1954).', u'Four vessels were used as the SS Minnow. One was towed to Kauai, Hawaii, for beach scenes, one was rented in Honolulu for the original opening credits and one was built at CBS Studios in the second season. The fourth one was used in the second-season opening credits. A subsequent owner was sailing it south from Alaska when it ran aground on a reef off the coast of British Columbia. It was purchased for salvage and restored. It was offered for sale in B.C. for $99,000. It was listed as a 37-foot twin-diesel, mahogany Wheeler Express Cruiser which sleeps five.', u'The theme song is the winner of the 2013 Yahoo TV Best TV Theme Song Ever. The 12th seed in a bracketed competition, it beat the theme from Cheers (1982) in the finals.', u'Raquel Welch auditioned for the role of Mary Ann.', u'Dawn Wells, who played Mary Ann, was terribly tone deaf. Whenever she sang, even if it was just a song like ""For He\'s a Jolly Good Fellow"", her off-key singing would throw everyone else off. Singer/songwriter Jackie DeShannon dubbed Mary Ann\'s singing voice for most of the times the character had to sing (an exception was Gilligan\'s Island: The Second Ginger Grant (1967), where Mary Ann\'s inability to sing was part of the plot).', u""Natalie Schafer's contract stipulated that there be no close-ups of her in the show. The reason was producers knew her real age, which was 13 years older than Jim Backus, who played her character's husband. It was not until years after the series ended that her co-stars found out her actual age."", u'The premise required that the characters use various devices that had to be constructed from only the various materials found on a tropical island. Thus the props had to be specially made and the prop department enjoyed the challenge, which was a change of pace from simply bringing in the standard props from storage. The bamboo foot pedal-powered car used in one episode was a particular favorite, with the cast lining up to try it out.', u'The show was originally slated to return for the 1967-68 season along with another new comedy show to replace the canceled ""Gunsmoke"" (1955)_. However, CBS reversed its decision and canceled ""Gilligan"" and kept ""Gunsmoke"", which ran for another eight seasons.', u""At one point during development, producers considered including a young nephew of the Professor's among the castaways. However, it was determined that given the child-like nature of Gilligan, a child among the castaways would be redundant."", u'The island shown in the opening and closing credits is actually located in Kaneohe Bay, about a mile offshore from the island of Oahu, in Hawaii.', u'Natalie Schafer said she initially did ""Marooned"" (1962), for the free trip to Hawaii. Afterwards, Schafer was in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, on holiday when she got a telegram from the US. She read it and burst into tears. Everyone had thought Schafer\'s mother (who was ill at the time) had died, and offered their condolences, but Schaefer said her mother hadn\'t died; the reason she was crying was because the pilot for ""Gilligan\'s Island"" sold, and she had to stay in Los Angeles, and could not move back to New York City.', u""Jayne Mansfield turned down the role of Ginger; Carroll O'Connor tested for the role of The Skipper; Dabney Coleman tested for the role of The Professor."", u'Jerry Van Dyke turned down the role of Gilligan.', u'With the show ready to go to air, Sherwood Schwartz had yet to come up with a theme song. When it came time for him to submit one, he decided to make the theme a story of how the characters got shipwrecked. It was then titled ""The Ballad of Gilligan\'s Island"".', u'Partly inspired by the 1939 film Five Came Back (1939) starring Lucille Ball. The characters in that film included a wayward pilot and co-pilot, a botanist and his wife, a sultry woman with a shady past, and a rich playboy and his homespun wife.', u'Phil Silvers was cast as a producer in an episode partly because his production company was actually producing the show.', u'The name ""Ginger Grant"" is believed to be taken from two stars of Hollywood\'s ""Golden Era"", Ginger Rogers and Cary Grant; the latter is frequently spoken of in this series. ""Ginger"" is a nickname in many places (including England) for someone with red hair.', u""Although it is a widespread belief that American television in the 1960s was not allowed to show women's navels, such anatomy is seen frequently in this series. Mary Ann's navel in particular is most commonly shown, but also occasionally that of Ginger, and some bit player guest stars and extras. Supposedly the producers discovered a loophole in the rules to allow this. In fact, the prohibition against showing a woman's navel was over by 1966."", u""The original series pilot Gilligan's Island: Marooned (1992) had different actors in the role of the Professor and two female castaways, Ginger and Bunny, both secretaries. Because of the cast changes, the original pilot was unairable until it was broadcast by TBS in 1992."", u'The character of the Professor was supposedly a graduate from SMU, TCU and UCLA,', u""The Professor's actual name in the series was Roy Hinkley Jr."", u'The lagoon set was located at the CBS lot in Studio City, CA. If sequences there were filmed too early or too late in the day, microphones would record rush hour traffic noise from a nearby freeway.', u'Sherwood Schwartz claimed that, contrary to popular belief, ""Robinson Crusoe"" was not the inspiration for the series, even though it was one of his favorite books and was referenced in the closing song.', u'The producer and main cast all lived to advance ages. Sherwood Schwartz lived to be 94 and Natalie Schafer (Lovey Howell) lived to 90. The shortest longevity was from Alan Hale Jr. (the Skipper), who died at 68. Bob Denver (Gilligan) died at 70, Russell Johnson (the Professor) died at 89. At the 50th anniversary on September 26, 2014, only two cast members still survived, Tina Louise (Ginger Grant) and Dawn Wells (Mary Ann). The two ladies were 80 and 75 years old, respectively. Also, three of the cast members died within 21 months of each other. Jim Backus (Mr. Howell) died in July 1989 at 76, the first of the cast to pass away. Six months later Alan Hale Jr. passed away, followed by Natalie Schafer 15 months later. Another actor would not die for more than 14 years later: Bob Denver.', u'One of the most burning questions among male viewers of the show has always been, ""Ginger or Mary Ann?"". Though there is no real answer to that question, the consensus seems to be that Dawn Wells got more fan mail from young boys, while Tina Louise got more fan mail from grown men. The difference is attributed to the fact that Mary Ann was the pretty and sweetly sexy girl next door that every teenage boy would love to go out with, while Ginger was the gorgeous, smoking-hot sex bomb that is every adult male\'s fantasy.', u""The Skipper's real name, Jonas Grumby, is mentioned in Gilligan's Island: Two on a Raft (1964), but never again in the series."", u'Jim Backus\' name of Thurston Howell III was named after ""Hubart Updyke III"", a character on ""The Alan Young Show"" on radio, written by this series\' producer, Sherwood Schwartz--and also played by Backus..', u'The song playing on Gilligan\'s radio is called ""Coconut Boogie"", performed by Jim Shipman and the Shipwrecks.', u'Of the seven castaways, the Skipper is known for breaking the fourth wall, i.e. looking directly into the camera and making a face. However, Ginger would occasionally do this as well, in particular, right after she tries to kiss Gilligan and he resists, usually knocking himself out. She then looks at the camera and shrugs.', u""It is revealed in Gilligan's Island: Two on a Raft (1964), (the second pilot) that the name of Mary-Ann's hometown was Winfield, Kansas. It is sometimes misreported as Horner's Corners, but that was the home of her boyfriend, Horace Higgenbotham."", u'Each of the three actresses on the show were married only once and their marriages were fairly short term. Natalie Schafer (Mrs. Howell) was married nine years, Dawn Wells was married five years, and Tina Louise was married four years.', u""Lovey Howell's maiden name is Eunice Wentworth. It was mentioned one time."", u'Ginger is the only castaway not to have a dream sequence.', u""The original script had Ginger as a more seductive character, willing to use her sex appeal to get what she wanted, and Mary Ann as a naive country girl. When 'Tina Louise' (qv was cast as Ginger she played the character as a more sweet-natured, innocent individual who seldom used her sex appeal for her own gains. Because they felt it was too similar to the original version of Mary Ann, that character was rewritten to be more level-headed and logical."", u'When Alan Hale Jr. played the part of ""the Skipper"", he referred to Gilligan as "" little buddy"" on a regular basis. Hale also played a guest role on+""The Andy Griffith Show"" (1957)_ as farmer ""Big Jeff Pruitt"" in Season 2 episode 13: ""The Farmer Takes a Wife"", prior to this series. In that episode, he refers to Don Knotts\' character Barney Fife, as ""little buddy"" on several occasions as well. According to producer Sherwood Schwartz, Hale had a habit of calling everyone ""little buddy"", so Schwartz incorporated that habit into the Skipper\'s character.', u""There has long been a rumor that Alan Young was originally supposed to be Gilligan, due to the fact that series creator Sherwood Schwartz had produced Young's comedy series on the radio, whose character was similar to that of Gilligan, and also because Jim Backus' character of Thurston Howell III was based on the same kind of character--also played by Backus--on Young's show. However, in an interview, Schwartz said that Young was never considered for the role. It came down to Bob Denver and another actor, who had an opportunity to make either this pilot or one for another series and chose the other pilot, which resulted in Denver being cast as Gilligan."", u'Alan Hale Jr. was 43 years old when the show started.', u'If you notice the Skipper\'s (Alan Hale, Jr\'s) left hand, he wears a green emerald ring. He wore this ring in homage to his father, Alan Hale, Sr. It is referenced in the first season episode ""Waiting for Watubi"" where the Skipper thinks he is dying, and wants to give it to Gilligan.', u'In January 2016, shortly after the deaths of musicians David Bowie and Glenn Frey, an obituary from CBS News began getting attention. The hashtag #RIPBobDenver began trending along with #RIP tags for Frey and Bowie, so many users of social media thought Denver had passed away along with Bowie and Frey, when in fact Denver had died in 2005.', u'Before playing the skipper of the Minnow, Alan Hale Jr. played the engineer of the Cannon Ball Express in the series Casey Jones (1957). Russell Johnson (The Professor) appeared as a guest in that series.', u""Sherwood Schwartz wrote the theme song to Gilligan's Island in just one night."", u""Sherwood Schwartz pitched the idea for the show to CBS executives multiple times and kept getting turned down because they thought it would be a huge failure. Finally, after much persistence he was given the green light to film the pilot episode in 1963. Throughout the show's first season run, the ratings from critics remained consistenly poor but ironically very high from TV audiences. Eventually, the show grew to be a huge success and lasted for 3 seasons."", u'It has often been observed that although they were on ""a three-hour tour,"" the castaways have an awful lot of supplies. The Professor has an extensive library, the Howells have myriad luxury items, etc.    It has also been said that although the Professor could build all sorts of intricate, complicated machinery from the few resources available on the island, he apparently never thought to just patch up the hole in the side of the Minnow so everyone could just sail off the island.    However, that is a mistaken rumor. The Professor and the rest of the castaways attempted to repair the boat multiple times.     For example, in one episode the Professor\'s homemade nails were used, but they shattered when hit with a hammer.    In another episode, a tree resin found by Gilligan was boiled down into a sort of superglue. But the glue failed after a few days, which resulted in the entire ship bursting apart down to its frame.']","[u'USA::26 September 1964', u'West Germany::15 August 1967', u'USA::16 October 1992']",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Buddy Ebsen later joked after the ""Beverly Hillbillies"" family members had ended how could anyone could believe such a naive thing.', u""Buddy Ebsen was offered the role of Jed Clampett on the strength of his playing a similar role in Breakfast at Tiffany's (1961)."", u""The show's opening theme song, sung by Jerry Scoggins, was #44 on the charts in 1962. Jerry's name appears as Jethro Scoggins during the closing credits."", u'Series creator Paul Henning got the idea for the show while on a trip through the South in 1959, visiting Civil War sites with his mother-in-law. He wondered what it would be like to take someone from the rural South in the Civil War era and put them down in the middle of a modern, sophisticated community. Originally it was to have been set in New York, but because of cost considerations the setting was changed to Beverly Hills.', u""The Clampett's truck was a 1921 Oldsmobile. It was lent by Cousin Pearl when the family moved to California."", u'Buddy Ebsen had seriously considered retiring from show business permanently, before filming and production began on their debuting together of The Beverly Hillbillies: The Clampetts Strike Oil (1962), in December of 1961.', u'(Saturday, June 13th, 2015) The Beverly Hillbillies (1962) has 13 episodes that were ranked in the Top 100 Nielsen Rated Shows of all time according to web site Zap2it.com.', u'Veteran character actress and voice artist Bea Benaderet was first considered for the role of Granny. Revisions in the character were made so that she would be more like ""Mammy Yokum"" in Al Capp\'s ""Li\'l Abner"" cartoon strip. Benaderet was too large and ""busty"" to fit that image. It was reportedly that Bea Benaderet, herself suggested Irene Ryan for the role, who by all accounts came in and ""blew everyone away"" with a wonderful screen test, which still survives today and is included as an extra on the DVD set.', u'The 1971 cancellation of the series Fred Silverman resulted from CBS\' desire to erase its image of being referred to as ""The Country Broadcasting System"" or ""The Rural Network."" The first rural themed sitcom to be cancelled was Petticoat Junction, which was replaced by the Mary Tyler Moore Show in the Fall of 1970. Then the following year, The Beverly Hillibilles and Green Acres were both canceled along with other similarly themed programs on the schedule by then CBS President, Fred Silverman. Even though the shows were still popular overall with viewers and drawing decent ratings in their timeslots, they didn\'t appeal to the younger urban demographic that advertisers wanted. Actor Pat Buttram who had played ""Mr. Haney"" on Green Acres was quoted as saying that ""CBS canceled every show with a tree in it, ...including Lassie!"".', u'The mansion in Beverly Hills where the Clampetts lived was actually the Kirkeby mansion in Bel Air. It was offered for sale in 2007 with an asking price of $30 million.', u'Louis Nye, he had character role ""Sonny"", Mrs. Drysdale\'s son, was only eight years younger than actress, Harriet E.

With the absence of the Internet, facts like these were hard to verify by the viewers. From 1973 to 1974 the NCRV aired the unaired episodes in the Netherlands.', u""When the show debuted on Wednesday, September 26th, 1962, Jed Clampett's fortune was given as $25,000,000. After adjusting for inflation, this amount would be equivalent to $195,000,000 in 2014. At the end of the show's run the fortune had climbed to $100,000,000, which would now be equivalent to $583,000,000."", u'Jed Clampett was originally written as an extremely naive hick, but Buddy Ebsen would only agree to take the role if it was re-written; Jed might be uneducated, but he wasn\'t foolish. The character of Jethro was written as someone to give a majority of the ""dumb"" lines.', u'An agreement was made between Filmways Productions and Arnold Kirkeby to film the exterior of the Kirkeby mansion. The agreement stipulated that the grounds had to be cleaned up after filming, and the address of the Kirkeby mansion was never to be divulged to the public.', u""Sonny's real name was Adonis."", u'After Donna Douglas aka ""Elly May Clampett"" passed away on Thursday, January 1st, 2015, Max Baer Jr. is the last surviving main cast member who played the role of ""Jethro Bodine"" (and his twin sister, ""Jethrine Bodine"", in season one.)', u""Just before the fourth season got underway, Mrs. Kirkeby apparently broke the agreement her late husband had made with Filmways Productions because the mansion's address was leaked. It caused an endless stream of tourists to come to the mansion, looking for Jed and Granny. Filmways was not allowed to film the mansion's exterior or any long shots of the mansion grounds after that."", u""During season one, Max Baer Jr. occasionally played a double role, of Jethro and his twin sister, Jethrine Bodine. Actress, Linda Henning, daughter of series creator, Paul Henning, supplied Jethrine Bodine's voice."", u'At the end of the opening credits you can see Jed start to point out something to the others towards camera left. In the network broadcasts, the camera changes to show that Jed is pointing to a billboard for Kellogg\'s Corn Flakes, the sponsor of the show. As the car drives past it, the theme song continues, changing to the then current slogan ""K-E-Double L-O-Double Good. Kellogg\'s best to you"". In other openings they drive by a Winston Cigarette truck. With the theme Winston tastes good as a cigarette should.', u'During the last six seasons, as the current weekly episode concluded, and Jerry Scoggins sang the closing tune, ""Elly May Clampett"", actress, Donna Douglas friendly spoke off screen, saying ""Thanks, and we\'ll be back, next week at this same time and same channel."", just as the Closing Credits were nearing the final ten seconds, and just before a commercial break started, of the next show.', u'The Beverly Hillbillies (1962)\'s pilot episode release date debut of _""The Beverly Hillbillies"" (1962) {The Clampetts Strike Oil (#1.1)_, by sheerest coincidence, was also actress, Donna Douglas\'s 29th birthday. Donna Douglas\'s popularity and fame rose with her character role of ""Elly May Clampett"" and wearing blue jeans a majority of the time, at home.', u'As well as serving as animal trainer, Frank Inn actually provided the animals used on the show as Elly May Clampett\'s ""critters"".', u'After the first season aired, a Levi-Strauss executive was quoted as saying that ""Donna Douglas had done more for the sale of blue jeans in one year than cowboys have done in a hundred.""', u'The mansion is located at 750 Bel Air Drive in Los Angeles.

Bushman a few times during the nine season run. He mentioned late western cowboy, Tom Mix's name in the series' debut, The Beverly Hillbillies: The Clampetts Strike Oil (1962)."", u'During the first two seasons, the show was the #1 top rated TV show in the country according to the Nielsen ratings. The third season was ranked #12. The fourth and fifth seasons were ranked #7. The sixth season ranked #12. The seventh season: #10. The eighth season: #18. Ninth season: #33.', u""Jethro Bodine, and his twin sister Jethrine father's name (in season 1 only) is Fred Bodine."", u""Sonny was Margaret Drysdale's son from a previous marriage. His actual last name was never revealed and he was always known as Sonny Drysdale."", u""When Nancy Kulp (who was a Democrat) was running for a political office in her home state back in the 1980's, Buddy Ebsen (who was a Republican) endorsed her running opponent publicly by appearing in a political ad that ran against her."", u""Raymond Bailey was already starting to suffer from the effects of Alzheimer's disease when the show was nearing the end of its run, it's apparent in some of his final scenes that he was not 100% healthy."", u'Season 9\'s episode, The Beverly Hillbillies: The Clampetts Meet Robert Audubon Getty Crockett (1971) revealed that the Clampett\'s hail from Limestone, Tennessee, and not the Ozarks as previously assumed. Granny is an ardent admirer of Daniel Boone; and comes from ""Boone country"",  which is basically the same area as WW1 hero, Sergeant Alvin C. York.', u'During its nine year run, Buddy Ebsen, Irene Ryan and Donna Douglas were the three actors to have appeared and/or acted in every episode of the series.', u'Off- the set, Buddy Ebsen and Nancy Kulp both had a political argument. He even supported her Republican opponent, incumbent Representative Bud Shuster, going so far as to tape an ad for Shuster that labeled Kulp as ""too liberal"". Ebsen claimed she was exploiting her celebrity status and did not know the issues.', u'Irene Ryan (who played Granny) once stated in an interview that she really enjoyed ""hitting"" Jethro. She said that anytime the script called for her to hit him, ""she let him have it""', u""The Clampetts' bloodhound name was Duke."", u""The names of Elly May Clampett's two pet chimpanzees were Skipper and Bessie."", u""Margaret Drysdale's father's name is Lowell Fahrquar."", u'The original title of the show was supposed to be ""The Hillbillies of Beverly Hills"". This was only seen in the original pilot episode ""The Clampetts Strike Oil"". It was changed to ""The Beverly Hillbillies"" in the second episode.   The theme song ""The Ballad of Jed Clampett"" originally debuted in episode two as well. In the pilot episode the song used was ""Banjo Signal"". The original name and theme is difficult to find today since in syndication, it\'s been changed to match the rest of the series.   The original name and theme song used in the pilot episode can be found on the official complete season one release along with an expanded pilot episode as well as the shows original sponsor endorsements.', u""Long before the series started, Buddy Ebsen became friends with Max Baer Jr.'s family. Ebsen met Baer's father at one of his boxing matches."", u'Buddy Ebsen\'s character of Jed Clampett was intended to be wise if not educated. In order to share his wisdom after Jetro demonstrated incredible ignorance, he had a quip that he was ""going to have a long talk with that boy"".

Peet saw them both as argumentative, cantankerous, but playful and very intelligent. Peet also gave Merlin Walt's nose. This was the second instance in which Walt unknowingly served as model for a wizard, the first being the wizard Yensid from the Sorcerer's Apprentice in Fantasia (1940). This explains why the character was given the name Yensid. This read backwards is Disney."", u""The last film in which Bill Peet served as a writer.

Sherman and Robert B. Sherman.

Previous features were directed either by three or four directors, or by a team of sequence directors under a supervising director. The man hired for the job was veteran animator Wolfgang Reitherman (one of the fabled Nine Old Men), who would direct all of the Disney features up until the 1980's."", u'Two songs written for the film but scrapped before production began were ""The Blue Oak Tree"" and ""The Magic Key"". ""The Blue Oak Tree"" was sung by Sir Ector and Sir Pelinore when they celebrated Kay\'s knighthood and ""The Magic Key"" was to be Merlin\'s lecture to Arthur about the value of an education. It was replaced with the more amusing ""Higitus Figitus"".', u'Many elements of Sleeping Beauty (1959) have been recycled into films such as The Sword in the Stone (1963), which reuses opening credit backgrounds and various animation sequences. The two most noticeable are the owl from the forest scene, who would inspire Archemedes, and Malificent in dragon form, which led to Madam Mim in dragon form.', u'In the Squirrel scene, Merlin tells Wart that when a ""girl squirrel chooses her man, it is for life!"". In reality, however, the male and the female squirrel spend only a couple of nights together in the female\'s nest during a mating season (usually twice a year, one between December-February and the other between June-August), after which the male leaves the nest forgetting all about his family. It is the female then who is responsible for raising the baby squirrels.', u'In the Squirrel scene, Merlin transforms himself into a gray squirrel, while Wart turns into a red. In reality, gray squirrels where imported into England (from their native north America) no sooner than 1870s, after which they gradually dominated all of the forests and made the red squirrel almost extinct on the British Islands. The story, however, takes place apparently during the Middle Ages, long before that time. It might be a deliberate feature in the movie, as Merlin is capable of seeing deep in the future.', u'Kay references the Cain and Abel story from Genesis with his ""I am not the Wart\'s keeper"" remark.', u'Arthur was voiced by three different boys - Rickie Sorensen, Richard Reitherman and Robert Reitherman. The changes in voice are very noticeable in the film because of the way Arthur\'s voice keeps going from broken to unbroken, sometimes in the same scene. One of the easiest noticed is in the last scene in the throne room when Arthur asks in his ""changed voice"", ""Oh, Archimedes, I wish Merlin was here!"" Then, the camera cuts farther back and Arthur shouts in his ""unchanged voice,"" ""Merlin!

These monologues were typically used as framing devices at the beginning and end of each episode and during scene transitions. In the earliest produced episodes, Dobie would be seen sitting in the same pose as the statue.', u'The occupation of Dobie\'s father was different in each of the short stories upon which the series was based.

Pomfritt, as in ""Pomme Frites"" is another name for ""Chips"", as in the beloved teacher in the film Goodbye, Mr. Chips (1939).', u""Actors William Schallert and Jean Byron, who often appeared on the series playing various teachers of Dobie in high school and college, went on to play Patty Duke's parents in the later sitcom, The Patty Duke Show (1963)."", u'Dwayne Hickman later reported not being fond of his on-screen love interest, Tuesday Weld, who left the series after the first season (save for two return appearances in later seasons) to pursue other roles.', u""Warren Beatty, cast as Dobie's nemesis Milton Armitage, did not enjoy working on the series. He left the series midway through the first season to return to stage work, and Steve Franken was cast as Chatsworth Osbourne Jr., a replacement character who appeared throughout the remainder of the series. Doris Packer, who had played Milton's mother Mrs. Armitage, was retained, with her character becoming Mrs. Chatsworth Osbourne Sr."", u'Bob Denver was drafted during the production of the series\' fourth produced episode, ""The Big Sandwich"". Maynard was therefore written out of the series with the episode ""Maynard\'s Farewell to the Troops"", and Michael J. Pollard was cast as Maynard\'s cousin Jerome Krebs, who would assume Maynard\'s role in future episodes. However, Denver failed his Army physical and was rejected ""4F"" by the draft board. After shooting two episodes with Pollard, this was decided to rehire Denver and write Maynard back into the series. Pollard had signed a ""play or pay"" contract, and was paid for all 30 episodes he had been signed for upon his dismissal.', u'To differentiate Dobie Gillis from Chuck McDonald, the character Dwayne Hickman played on The Bob Cummings Show (1955), Max Shulman and Fox required Hickman to dye his dark brown hair blond. Their concern was that the sponsors would feel audiences would confuse Dobie with Chuck, a character on a different series with different sponsors. Continually bleaching his hair caused Hickman to suffer hair loss and blisters on his scalp, and after appealing to the producers, he was allowed to stop bleaching his hair after the first season.', u'Zelda knew Dobie loved her because she wrinkled up her nose and Dobie involuntarily did this back in spite of himself.', u'Max Shulman and his writers had little knowledge of beatniks, a term used by outsiders to refer to devotees of the Beat Generation philosophy, so Bob Denver visited Los Angeles area coffee shops and hipster hangouts in order to help create Maynard G. Krebs.', u'Despite being cast as teens, Dwayne Hickman was 24 and Bob Denver was 23 when they filmed the pilot in mid-1958.', u'During Season One and the first half of Season Two, the ""Thinker"" set is also an actual location in the context of the show, a section of the Central City park. After Dobie joins the Army in season two, the park set is replaced with a ""void"" set featuring only Dobie and the statue of ""The Thinker"". In seasons three and four, Dobie would employ props, usually large photos of the principal players, in his monologues.', u'Cashing in on the series\' popularity, a line of young men\'s leisure apparel, ""Dobie Gillis Originals"", was launched. The tags featured humorous annotations such as ""Like, lifted from Maynard"".', u""The role of Davey Gillis, Dobie Gillis' older brother in three Season One episodes, was played by Darryl Hickman, Dwayne Hickman's real-life older brother."", u'The song ""Love is a Many Splendored Thing"" is often used as background music when Dobie is feeling romantic because 20th Century Fox, the producers of the series, owned the rights to the song and did not have to pay for its use.', u'Whenever Maynard hears the word ""work"", this startles him and he responds by saying ""work!"" in a frightened high-pitched voice, while jumping slightly.

Even Patricia Neal, with whom Peppard had been friendly in the past, noticed a change in the actor -- and not for the better. Peppard, she felt, had been ""spoiled."" Peppard felt from the outset that Neal\'s character was too dominant. ""He wanted things as he wanted them,"" she later said of Peppard. ""I dominated him a lot more in the script and he didn\'t want to be seen in that condition...

Phyllis (Cloris Leachman) tries to correct him by saying just ""E"". Ted then says ""oh yeah, Truman E. Capot.""', u'In his audio commentary for the DVD release, producer Richard Shepherd said that, at the time of production as well as in retrospect, he wanted to recast Mickey Rooney ""not because he [Rooney] didn\'t play the part well"" but because Shepherd thought the part of Mr. Yunioshi should be performed by an actor of Japanese ethnicity. It was Blake Edwards\' decision to keep Rooney. In a ""making-of"" for the 45th anniversary edition DVD release, Shepherd repeatedly apologizes, saying, ""If we could just change Mickey Rooney, I\'d be thrilled with the movie."" Edwards stated, ""Looking back, I wish I had never done it... and I would give anything to be able to recast it, but it\'s there, and onward and upward.""', u""John Frankenheimer was hired to shoot the film with Marilyn Monroe. When the producers suddenly moved to Switzerland and Audrey Hepburn replaced Monroe, she said she had never heard of Frankenheimer and insisted that he be paid off and another director be hired. Frankenheomer's sudden freedom resulted in his directing The Manchurian Candidate (1962)."", u'It was Blake Edwards who brought Henry Mancini into the project, after Mancini had scored a hit with the theme from Peter Gunn (1958), though the producers were initially keen on a Broadway composer to fit the New York City milieu of the film. Mancini brought in Johnny Mercer as his lyricist, and so ""Moon River"" was born. Early titles for the song included ""I\'m Holly"" and ""Blue River"".', u'Audrey Hepburn moved to New York from Switzerland for the location shoot with husband Mel Ferrer and new baby Sean in tow.', u""Holly's couch is really an old-fashioned bathtub split in half.

They hired me to do this overboard, and we had fun doing it.... Never in all the more than 40 years after we made it -- not one complaint. Every place I\'ve gone in the world people say, \'God, you were so funny.\' Asians and Chinese come up to me and say, \'Mickey you were out of this world.\'"" Rooney also said that if he\'d known people would be so offended, ""I wouldn\'t have done it. Those that didn\'t like it, I forgive them and God bless America, God bless the universe, God bless Japanese, Chinese, Indians, all of them and let\'s have peace.""', u'According to the screenplay, 2-E\'s real name is Emily Eustace, hence the nickname ""2-E.""', u'Truman Capote maintained that he based Holly Golightly on Carol Grace (the former wife of William Saroyan and future wife of Walter Matthau), who had been a friend of his while living in New York.', u'The location shots for the exterior of the apartment building where Holly Golightly and Paul Varjak reside is 167 East 71st Street, between Third & Lexington Avenues in Manhattan. The building is unchanged as of 2016. Look for it on the TCM On Location Tours in NYC.', u'The movie\'s poster was as #18 of ""The 25 Best Movie Posters Ever"" by Premiere.', u'The lines of dialog ""How do I look?"", ""Very good. I must say, I\'m amazed"" and ""I am a very stylish girl"" were sampled in the Dimitri From Paris song ""Une Very Stylish Fille"".', u'Audrey Hepburn supposedly exclaimed ""over my dead body"" when it was suggested that ""Moon River"" be removed from the film. However, there\'s an alternative recollection of this event. On the DVD of ""Breakfast at Tiffany\'s Anniversary Edition,"" co-producer Richard Shepherd says in his commentary that after a premiere in San Francisco, Paramount\'s Head of Production desired to have ""Moon River"" removed from the film but co-producer Martin Jurow ""and I both said \'over our dead bodies.\'""', u'Steve McQueen was offered the co-starring role. However, he was still under contract for the show Wanted: Dead or Alive (1958), which prevented him from appearing. The role eventually went to George Peppard.', u'Although the story in the movie occurs in 1960, the story in the novella is penned as occuring in 1943.', u'All of the interiors, except for portions of the scene inside Tiffany & Company, were filmed on the Paramount Studios lot in Hollywood.', u'For his portrayal of I.Y. Yunioshi, Mickey Rooney wore makeup and a prosthetic mouthpiece to change his features to a caricatured approximation of a Japanese person. Since the 1990s, his portrayal has been subject to increasing protest by Asian-Americans, among others.', u'The film\'s song, ""Moon River,"" was to be called ""Blue River"" until lyricist Johnny Mercer remembered that there had already been an earlier song by that name written by a friend of his. So as not to alter the meter of his lyrics, he substituted ""moon"" for ""blue,"" though he later regretted not replacing the adjective in the passage ""my huckleberry friend"" with one more relevant (deep blue-hued huckleberries being appropriately descriptive of a Blue River, but not a Moon River).', u'Alan Reed, who plays Sally Tomato, was the voice of Fred Flintstone of The Flintstones (1960), a Hanna-Barbera cartoon. The Huckleberry Hound Show (1958) - a mask that Holly picks up in the store - is also a Hanna-Barbera cartoon.', u'Contrary to popular belief, the movie follows Truman Capote\'s original novel quite closely. The character of Mag Wildwood, the Amazon-like model who crashes Holly\'s party in the film, is a major character in the novel. Capote describes her as having a stutter. In the film, Mag does indeed stutter though this isn\'t explained. During the shoplifting sequence, Holly briefly dons a The Huckleberry Hound Show (1958) mask, mirroring the line ""my Huckleberry friend"" in her song, ""Moon River."" Although Audrey Hepburn\'s performance of ""Moon River"" is unsurpassed, it would not be officially released until after her death. Holly\'s ""bad date"" prior to her first visit to Paul\'s apartment is only heard behind a door. The man who provides this voice is uncredited, but he sounds a lot like Mel Blanc, who at the time was working with film co-star Alan Reed on The Flintstones (1960).', u""Both Fred Flinstone (Alan Reed as Sally Tomato) and Barney Rubble (Mel Blanc as Holly's Drunk Visitor) appear in this film."", u'Kim Novak turned down the role of Holly Golightly.', u'The perfume Holly is spraying in the apartment hallway during her drunken scenes is Makila by Jean Patou.', u'""Moon River"" has since been recorded more than 500 times.', u'Holly\'s real name is Lullamae, which means ""Famous Warrior born in the Month of May"". The name she chooses for herself is Holiday, Holiday meaning ""Born on a Holy Day"". In real life, Audrey Hepburn\'s birthday happens to be May 4th.', u""The interior of Holly's apartment is much larger than it could have been in the actual New York City brownstone used for exteriors."", u'Several exterior scenes had to be reshot after the processing lab accidentally damaged one of the film reels. Cinematographer Franz Planer was no longer available for the reshoots however, and Blake Edwards brought in Philip H. Lathrop to take his place.', u'Included among the ""1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die"", edited by Steven Schneider.', u'Jean Seberg was considered to play Holly.', u'When 2-E says ""Love Finds Andy Hardy"" to Paul, it is likely a nod to the fact Mickey Rooney played Andy Hardy and is also in this film.', u'Premiered at the famed Radio City Music Hall in New York City.', u'Known in France as ""Diamonds on Toast"".', u'The film is referenced by the song ""Breakfast at Tiffany\'s"" by Deep Blue Something, which was a big international hit in the 1990s.', u'When played on the piano, ""Moon River"" doesn\'t require the use of any black keys.', u""Rusty Trawler's full name is Rutherford Trawler."", u'Michael Zaslow appears uncredited as a party guest.', u""The wild party scene in this film later served as the inspiration for a 1968 episode of That Girl in which Ann Marie (Marlo Thomas) throws a New Year's Eve party that spins out of control when everyone in the neighborhood decides to crash the festvities."", u'Truman Capote sold the film rights for $650,000. He was later profoundly annoyed to discover later on that the man who adapted his novel - George Axelrod - earned more than he did.', u""Included among the American Film Institute's 1998 list of the 400 movies nominated for the Top 100 Greatest American Movies."", u'Two different Halloween masks of Huckleberry Hound are seen in the 5 & 10 cent store. The lyric in the title song Moon River references ""my huckleberry friend"". The implication of the ""true blue"" friend, a blue cartoon dog and a cerulean body of water are neatly packaged theme of the film.', u""In September 2017, Tiffany & Co. bought the original 1961 working script (with deleted scenes and notes in Hepburn's handwriting) for \xa3632,750 ($846,619) at Christie's auction house in London. Selling for more than the second and third highest items sold in the auction that day combined; it's the most expensive film script ever bought at auction."", u'In the French post-synchronized version of the film, the actors are dubbed by: Jacqueline Carrel (Audrey Hepburn); Roland M\xe9nard (George Peppard); Sylvie Deniau (Patricia Neal); Georges Hubert (Buddy Ebsen); Michel Gudin (Martin Balsam); Georges Riquier (John McGiver); Andr\xe9 Valmy (Alan Reed) and Pierre Trabaud (Mickey Rooney).', u'In the Italian post-synchronized version of the film, the actors are dubbed by: Maria Pia Di Meo (Audrey Hepburn); Pino Locchi (George Peppard); Nino Pavese (Buddy Ebsen); Nando Gazzolo (Martin Balsam) and Luigi Pavese (John McGiver).', u'Queen used the film\'s title in the lyrics of the song ""Let me entertain you"" from their 1979 album Jazz.', u'Mel Blanc: Holly\'s ""Over-eager Date"" was played by none other than the legendary voice actor.', u""Blake Edwards: [cat] The slapstick business with Cat presages Edwards' smash-hit franchise of The Pink Panther (1963) which was jam packed with feline imagery."", u'Audrey Hepburn said the scene where she throws Cat into the rainy street was the most distasteful thing she ever had to do on film.', u'Emily ""2E"" Eustace does not appear in the source novella. The subplot of Paul serving as 2E\'s ""kept man"" was apparently added to the movie to establish the heterosexual credentials of George Peppard\'s character. This then allowed for the movie\'s boy-gets-girl climax, something also not found in the novella. It also gave Peppard a chance to appear bare-chested in a bedroom setting, the very best ""beefcake"" scene in his entire movie career.', u'Most of the exteriors were filmed in New York City, except the fire escape scenes and the alley scene at the end in the rain where Holly puts Cat out of the cab and then Paul and Holly look for Cat.']","[u'USA::5 October 1961', u'USA::17 October 1961 (Los Angeles, California)\n (premiere)', u'UK::19 October 1961 (London)\n (premiere)', u'Italy::November 1961 (Rome)\n (premiere)', u'Japan::4 November 1961', u'Brazil::13 November 1961', u'France::6 December 1961', u'UK::15 December 1961', u'Netherlands::21 December 1961', u'Greece::22 December 1961', u'Sweden::26 December 1961', u'Austria::5 January 1962', u'Finland::12 January 1962', u'West Germany::12 January 1962', u'Italy::23 January 1962', u'Portugal::31 January 1962', u'Denmark::16 March 1962', u'Argentina::17 April 1962', u'Mexico::26 April 1962', u'Hong Kong::7 June 1962', u'Turkey::5 February 1963', u'Spain::12 November 1963', u'Hungary::20 September 1973', u'France::25 April 2007 (re-release)', u'Greece::19 June 2008 (re-release)', u'Philippines::11 February 2009 (Audrey Hepburn Film Festival)', u'UK::21 January 2011 (re-release)', u'France::9 January 2013 (re-release)', u'Japan::28 September 2013 (re-release) (digitally re-mastered version)', u'Italy::13 February 2014 (re-release)', u'China::22 April 2015 (Beijing International Film Festival)']",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Later, he can be seen reading an issue of TV Guide, with the stars of Maverick (1957), James Garner and Jack Kelly, on the cover. Both of those shows were produced by Warner Brothers, as was this one.', u'The character of Stu Bailey originally appeared in one novel and three short stories written by Series Creator Roy Huggins.', u'Sponsors included Anacin aspirin, Certs antacid tablets, and Salem Cigarettes.', u'The ""Dino\'s Lodge"", that featured performances in numerous episodes, often includes the Frankie Ortega Trio. The trio were a Los Angeles-based three-piece jazz band signed with Warner Brothers Records, and that often headlined at the real-life Dino\'s during their heyday of the 1950s and 60s.', u""The building in which the detectives' offices were located was, in real-life, the home of the Mary Webb Davis modelling agency. The front of the building, the Dino's Lodge driveway, and part of Dino's, were reproduced on a Warner Brothers soundstage, which is where most of the scenes that took place in that area were filmed. The doorknob on the real door was on the left, and that's where it was on the mock-up in the earliest episodes. Later, for some reason, they moved the knob on the soundstage version to the right. The Mary Webb Davis office was eventually replaced by the Tiffany Theatre. The building has since been torn down."", u""This was the first of Warner Brothers' formulaic detective series.

Alas, Perry is still able to clear the defendant. Mason\'s most famous ""loss"" occurred in Perry Mason: The Case of the Deadly Verdict (1963). The show uncharacteristically opens in the courtroom. A decision is being handed down. Perry\'s client is found guilty of murdering her aunt for money. To pump up interest in this particular case, which ran in October 1963, teasers were released to the press that in September, the official beginning of the 1963-64 season, Will Perry lose his biggest case ever?

She was awarded $2.3m, but not without a lengthy legal battle with the studio which was finally settled in 1991.', u""The film's setting was partly inspired by Walt Disney's boyhood hometown of Marceline, Missouri."", u'Verna Felton, who voices Aunt Sarah, is the mother of actor Lee Millar, who provided the voice of Jim Dear.', u'In early script versions, Tramp was first called Homer, then Rags and Bozo. A 1940 script introduced the twin Siamese cats. Eventually known as Si and Am, they were then named Nip and Tuck.', u""The first feature-length animated movie to be made in widescreen (2.55:1). Made simultaneously in both a widescreen CinemaScope version and a standard Academy ratio version. It's also the widest film the company has ever created."", u""In 1937, story man Joe Grant approached Walt Disney with some sketches he had made of his Springer spaniel called Lady. Disney really liked the sketches and told Grant to put them into a storyboard. However, Disney ultimately didn't think much of the finished storyboard. Six years later, he read a short story in Cosmopolitan by Ward Greene called 'Happy Dan the Whistling Dog'. He was sufficiently interested in the story to buy the rights to it. Then in 1949, after Joe Grant had left the studio, his spaniel drawings were unearthed and a solid story using his designs started to take shape. Grant never received any acknowledgement for his contribution to the film until the Platinum Edition DVD in 2006."", u'The original story was created by Joe Grant while Lumikki ja seitsem\xe4n k\xe4\xe4pi\xf6t\xe4 (1937) was nearing post-production. Ward Greene used Joe Grant\'s original version as the basis for his novel. Greene\'s novel was still being written while the film was still in production. Grant\'s wife was said to have been angry over the story being ""stolen"" but Walt Disney maintained all legal rights to the story.', u""The studio's first officially self-penned story since Dumbo (1941)."", u'In the 1999 video release, some scenes had pieces of dialogue missing that had been part of the original theatrical release. This was believed to be caused by the studio restoration process that incorporated both US and international formats of the film, which inadvertently created a hybrid version. Disney often produces different international and foreign versions of their films to make the foreign dialogue fit.', u""When Lady and the Tramp have a night on the town they put their paw prints in a heart with an arrow through it with the initials J.M. and E.B. Tramps paw prints appear under the J.M. while Lady's appear under E.B."", u'In early versions of the script The Rat was named Herman.', u'As the story was being developed at the studio, Ward Greene wrote a novelization. Walt Disney insisted that this be released some two years before the film itself to give audiences time to familiarize themselves with the plot.', u""Disney's 15th animated feature."", u'CinemaScope presented some new problems for the animators. The wider canvas space made it difficult for a single character to dominate the screen, and groups had to be spread out to keep the screen from appearing too sparse.', u""The background artists made models of the interiors of Jim Dear and Darling's house and shot photos from a deliberately low angle to simulate a dog's eye view of their world."", u'As the release date neared, Walt Disney was dismayed to learn that not all theaters were equipped to show a film in CinemaScope. Consequently, another version of the film had to be made, this time in original aspect ratio.', u'The decision to film in Cinemascope was made when the film was already in production, so many background paintings had to be extended to fit the new format. Overlays were often added to cover up the seams of the extensions.', u'Walt Disney read Ward Greene\'s story, ""Happy Dan, the Whistling Dog"" in Cosmopolitan magazine in 1943 and eventually hired Greene to include the Dan character in the film during the pre-production stage. But Greene wrote and published an entirely new story ""Lady and the Tramp; the Story of Two Dogs,"" which became the source of the film.', u'The song howled by the dogs in the pound is ""Home Sweet Home"" and was performed by The Mellomen. It is the only song to be in the film that was not written by Peggy Lee and Sonny Burke.', u'Lady\'s first appearance in the film was inspired by an event in Walt Disney\'s personal life. In the late 1920s Disney put a Chow puppy in a hat box and gave it to his wife Lillian as a surprise Christmas present. This gesture was reproduced in ""Lady and the Tramp.""', u'Peggy Lee helped promote the film on the Disney TV series, explaining her work with the score and singing a few numbers.', u'When we are in the ""December"" month of Darling\'s pregnancy, we see her writing down some girl names. The names are Betty Ann, Betty Lou, Betty Ann Lou, Betty Lou Ann, Mary, and Mary Lou. Betty Ann Lou and Mary Lou get crossed off the list.', u'This was the last Disney film Wolfgang Reitherman worked on as an animator. He would move on to directing after this film.', u""The 1962 re-release of this film was shown on a double bill with the first release of Disney's Almost Angels (1962)."", u'There is a conspiracy theory that there was a subliminal message to kids when they were sliding down the side of the apartments there is clearly seen a couple making love.', u'The last Disney animated feature co-directed by Wilfred Jackson. During production of ""Lady and the Tramp"" in 1953, Jackson suffered a heart attack and was never able to resume full-time duties at the studio. After working sporadically on Disney\'s TV shows he took an extended leave of absence in 1959, and officially retired two years later.', u""Included among the American Film Institute's 1998 list of the 400 movies nominated for the Top 100 Greatest American Movies."", u'In the climax of the picture, Trusty was originally killed when hit by the wagon. That is why Jock nudges him and he does not rouse. When Walt Disney viewed this scene, he was shocked, not wanting a repeat of the traumatic scene in Bambi (1942), thinking that it was too intense. Walt then made the animators put Trusty into the end Christmas scene with a Broken Leg to reassure the audience that Trusty was simply knocked out and injured in the previous scene.', u'The mischievous young puppy at the end of the film (the one who resembles his father, Tramp) is called ""Scamp"". He was featured in a children\'s book, a syndicated daily comic strip, and comic books, before starring in Lady and the Tramp 2: Scamp\'s Adventure (2001).', u'Nearly every trailer for the movie spoils the plot point of Lady and Tramp having puppies at the end of the film.', u""The filmmakers felt that the two fight scenes in the film should both have distinctly different approaches. For the scene of Tramp fighting the Strays they treated it as a schoolyard scuffle, one that the Tramp doesn't take seriously while the fight with the Rat was treated as a battle to the death. The differences are made more clear with the Tramp being visibly hurt in one and snorting at his opponents in the other."", u'In order to make the climactic fight between the rat and the Tramp more exciting Wolfgang Reitherman animated from the point of view of the loser and then attempted to avoid that particular outcome.', u'One of the few Disney films in which there is no clear villain although Aunt Sarah could be considered one. The Rat is not generally classified as a villain as his actions are not malicious but are rather purely instinctive.', u'Jock appears again in 101 Dalmatians (1961)']","[u'USA::16 June 1955 (Chicago, Illinois)\n (premiere)', u'USA::22 June 1955', u'Argentina::11 August 1955', u'UK::16 August 1955', u'Portugal::28 September 1955', u'Italy::15 December 1955', u'Sweden::19 December 1955', u'Belgium::23 December 1955', u'Finland::23 December 1955', u'France::23 December 1955', u'Ireland::23 December 1955', u'Netherlands::23 December 1955', u'Denmark::26 December 1955', u'Norway::26 December 1955', u'Australia::23 February 1956', u'Japan::10 August 1956', u'Hong Kong::20 September 1956', u'West Germany::14 December 1956', u'Mexico::19 December 1956', u'Brazil::24 December 1956', u'Turkey::26 December 1956', u'Uruguay::1 January 1957 (Montevideo)', u'Austria::11 January 1957', u'Spain::21 April 1957 (Madrid)', u'Philippines::5 December 1959 (Davao)', u'Israel::21 December 1960', u'Poland::1962', u'USA::26 September 1962 (re-release)', u'Peru::13 September 1964', u'Japan::24 July 1965 (re-release)', u'France::13 November 1966 (re-release)', u'Italy::9 December 1966 (re-release)', u'Sweden::10 December 1966 (re-release)', u'Belgium::23 December 1966 (Gent) (re-release)', u'Russia::1969', u'USA::17 December 1971 (re-release)', u'Czechoslovakia::1 December 1974', u'Italy::7 March 1975 (re-release)', u'West Germany::28 March 1975 (re-release)', u'UK::9 April 1975 (re-release)', u'Finland::19 December 1975 (re-release)', u'Japan::24 July 1976 (re-release)', u'France::8 December 1976 (re-release)', u'Netherlands::5 April 1979 (re-release)', u'USA::7 March 1980 (re-release)', u'West Germany::24 September 1981 (re-release)', u'Italy::13 April 1982 (re-release)', u'Japan::17 July 1982 (re-release)', u'Australia::13 December 1984 (re-release)', u'France::20 March 1985 (re-release)', u'USA::19 December 1986 (re-release)', u'Brazil::7 October 1988 (re-release)', u'Sweden::24 February 1989 (re-release)', u'West Germany::16 March 1989 (re-release)', u'France::22 March 1989 (re-release)', u'Australia::23 March 1989 (re-release)', u'Brazil::29 June 1989 (re-release)', u'Japan::22 July 1989 (re-release)', u'Brazil::7 March 1997 (re-release) (redubbed)', u'Poland::30 May 1997 (re-release)', u'Australia::19 June 1997 (re-release)', u'Spain::20 June 1997 (re-release)', u'France::25 June 1997 (re-release)', u'Netherlands::26 June 1997 (re-release)', u'Italy::27 June 1997 (re-release)', u'Portugal::27 June 1997 (re-release)', u'Germany::3 July 1997 (re-release)', u'Estonia::11 July 1997', u'Hungary::17 July 1997 (re-release)', u'UK::18 July 1997 (re-release)', u'Ireland::18 July 1997 (re-release)', u'Denmark::25 July 1997 (re-release)', u'Sweden::25 July 1997 (re-release)', u'Finland::15 August 1997 (re-release)', u'Czech Republic::28 August 1997 (re-release)', u'Turkey::24 October 1997 (re-release)', u'Kuwait::24 November 1997', u""Norway::30 April 2002 (Kristiansand International Children's Film Festival)"", u'Norway::4 November 2005 (re-release)']",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

An athlete in his youth, he was actually a stuntman in Hollywood for a time back in the silent era before he teamed up with partner Bud Abbott, and was renowned for taking spectacular pratfalls in his films and on stage. Stuntmen were used for the more potentially dangerous stunts--being knocked through walls, getting hit by cars, etc.--but most of the falls you see Costello take were actually done by him. For example, in the episode ""The Tax Return"", there\'s a scene in which two crooks break into Bud & Lou\'s apartment, and a rather knock-down, drag-out brawl erupts. Although it looks like a stuntman is doubling for Lou in the fight scene, at one point the ""stuntman"" turns around and it is very clear that it actually is Costello doing the fighting.', u""In the first season, Bud Abbott and Lou Costello had a pet chimp named Bingo the Chimp. Costello didn't particularly like Bingo and apparently Bingo sensed it, because while they were filming a scene one day, Bingo turned and bit him. Costello demanded that Bingo be fired, and since his company was producing the show, Bingo was gone the next week and was never mentioned in the series again."", u'During filming, one camera was always kept on Lou Costello because he was constantly improvising. The funniest bits of business were then edited into the episode whether they had anything to do with the storyline or not.', u'Although Hillary Brooke appears a lot taller than Lou Costello in the show she is in reality only one inch taller. She wore high heels to make it appear she was taller.', u'Stinky Davis (Joe Besser) is portrayed as being less than ten years old.

Bud Abbott chose to work on salary.', u'Although other characters on the show called Lou Costello by either his first or last name, Hillary Brooke always called him ""Louis"", a name no other character ever used for him. Similarly, she always referred to Bud Abbott as ""Mr. Abbott"", even when speaking to him directly, though other characters called him by either his first or last name.']","[u'USA::5 December 1952 (New York City, New York)', u'UK::14 September 1957']",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The animators objected. ""We can\'t use that. There are too many background noises on the film."" Disney smiled, and told them, ""That\'s *your* problem,"" then walked out of the room. Eventually, with much labor, the Disney sound technicians managed to re-record Wynn\'s dialogue and erase all the background noises, so that Wynn\'s ad-libs were used in the final animated film.

This would not occur again until The Jungle Book (1967).', u'Continuing the pattern of film versions of ""Alice\'s Adventures in Wonderland"" not being commercially successful, this movie was a huge box office failure. However, it did become something of a cult film during the 1960s, where it was viewed as a ""head film"". Several years later it became the Disney studio\'s most requested 16mm film rental title for colleges and private individuals. In 1974, the studio took note of this fact, withdrew the rental prints, and reissued the film nationally themselves', u'Originally, Alice was to sing a song different from ""In a World of My Own"". It would be a slow ballad entitled ""Beyond the Laughing Sky"", and it was a song about Alice dreaming of a new world, a world better than her own, very much in the spirit of Dorothy Gale in The Wizard of Oz (1939). However, Kathryn Beaumont had difficulty singing, and it was decided that starting the film off with a slow ballad would be a little risky on audiences. The song we hear today, ""In a World of My Own"", is livelier, and was easier for Beaumont to sing.', u'Early drafts of the script had The Cheshire Cat\'s recitation of the opening lines of ""Jabberwocky"" give way to an actual encounter with the Jabberwock itself (to have been voiced by Stan Freberg), from Lewis Carroll\'s poem ""Jabberwocky"". The sequence was rejected, either because it slowed the story down, or because of concerns that it would be too frightening. Elements of ""Jabberwocky"" remain in the film, however: aside from the Cheshire Cat\'s song ""T\'was Brillig"" consisting of the opening stanza, the Tulgey Wood sequence includes at least one of the creatures mentioned in the poem, ""The Mome Raths"". Concept art was made of the Jabberwock, the Bandersnatch, and the Jub Jub Bird. The Jabberwock had fiery eyes, the Bandersnatch had a long neck and a net for a tail, and one of many concepts for the Jub Jub Bird survives as the vulture-like ""umbrella birds"" that gave Alice a mean look when she interrupted their bath. Another concept for the Jub Jub Bird was a large eagle-like creature.', u""The English novelist Aldous Huxley worked with Walt Disney on early scripts for this project in late 1945. The original idea was for a cartoon version of Alice embedded in a flesh-and-blood episode from Lewis Carroll's life. Huxley's mother, Julia Arnold, was one of the little girls that Carroll used to enjoy photographing, and to whom he told the Alice stories. The project was close to Huxley's heart, but Disney found his work too intellectual, and it was not used. Huxley received no credit on the finished picture."", u""This was the first Disney theatrical film to be shown on television, in 1954. It was shown as the second installment of the Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color (1954) TV show, edited to fit into a one-hour time slot. It is also the only Disney feature-length cartoon film to have its first theatrical re-release after it had already been shown on television (although the film had been televised only in an edited, one-hour version)."", u'Walt Disney toyed with the idea of having a live-action Alice explore an animated Wonderland, similar to the Alice Comedies starring Virginia Davis, Margie Gay, and Lois Hardwick. Color screen tests of Mary Pickford as Alice were made for a proposed live-action/animation version of the story.', u'An earlier adaptation was planned for the 1930s. The storyboards were done by the talented British artist David Hall. It was a bit closer to the book, but it was rejected for being too scary. Amongst the concepts from this version was the Mad Hatter and March Hare chasing Alice with a knife and scissors, the Cheshire Cat with hundreds of sharp teeth, and Alice nearly beheaded by a grinding gear.', u'The only Disney animated film that had to wait more than 20 years for its first theatrical re-release.', u'The Mad Hatter is apparently based on the phrase ""mad as a hatter"" which has a historical basis. In the hat industry of the 19th century there was extensive use of mercury. Liquid mercury is one of the causes of mercury poisoning, which (among other things) causes brain damage. Among the symptoms are slurred speech, memory loss, and tremors, behavior that can be seen as insane.', u'""Lux Radio Theater"" broadcast a 60-minute radio adaptation of the Walt Disney version on December 24, 1951, with Kathryn Beaumont, Jerry Colonna, and Ed Wynn reprising their film roles.', u'Besides Alice, Kathryn Beaumont is also known for voicing Wendy Darling in Peter Pan (1953). She was asked to continue voicing the two characters in later Disney projects until her retirement in 2005.

She also appears as a Princess of Heart in the Disney-related video game franchise Kingdom Hearts (2002).', u""This was the first feature film for which Walt Disney was able to use television for cross-promotion. Disney's very first television program, One Hour in Wonderland (1950), which was broadcast on Christmas evening of 1950, was devoted to the production of this film. Naturally, the entire program, including the clips from the movie, was in black and white."", u""Dink Trout's final movie.

It is a rare moment of violence from Alice. It is omitted from the film."", u'The Dormouse is a lazy and sleepy character in both the original novel and the Disney film. His role however is slightly different. In the novel he narrates a tale about three young girls. In the film he recites the poem ""Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Bat"", a parody of ""Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star"". In the novel the one who recites the poem is the Mad Hatter.', u'The King of Hearts in the original novel is a force of moderation in the reign of his wife. He quietly pardons many of the subjects the Queen has ordered to be beheaded when the Queen is not looking. This guarantees few people are actually beheaded.', u'The film omits the character of Puppy, a playful dog from the original novel. Puppy is also omitted from many adaptations of the novel, though he is given an expanded role in Alice in Wonderland (2010) by Tim Burton. He is also given a proper name in this film, Bayard.', u'In an interview with gossip-columnist Hedda Hopper, Walt Disney explained that the Queen of Hearts was somewhat based on rival gossip-columnist Louella Parsons, who was similarly ill-tempered and wore her dark hair in a bun.', u'There was a ton of cut songs composed for this film (over 30 according to some sources). A few were reworked into songs for other projects. For example, ""Second Star to the Right"" and ""Never Smile At a Crocodile"" from Peter Pan (1953) were going to be ""Beyond the Laughing Sky"", sung by Alice, and ""Lobster Quadriddle"", the latter which made it into Alice in Wonderland (1937). There were also a couple of cut songs for Mr. Cattarpillar and the Cheshire Cat - the Caterpillar got ""Dream Caravan"", the Cheshire Cat got ""I\'m Odd"". On the 2004 Masterpiece Edition DVD, Jim Cummings does sing ""I\'m Odd"" as the Cheshire Cat.', u'In the 1960s, the Alice novels and their adaptations became associated with the counterculture movement and drug culture. The most notable reference to this association was the hit song ""White Rabbit"" (1967) by Jefferson Airplane. It interpreted surreal moments from the novels as effects of sensory distortions experienced with hallucinogens.', u'In the original Alice novel, Bill the Lizard has no profession. His most notable scene involves him climbing a chimney. The Disney film depicts him as a chimney sweep.', u""Despite its popularity in the late 20th and 21st centuries, the Cheshire Cat appears to have failed to capture readers and artists' imaginations in the original era of publication. It rarely appeared in art and literature until the 1950s. The Disney version of the character is considered a likely source for its popularization."", u'The Mad Hatter is called simply ""The Hatter"" in the original novel. The Cheshire Cat describes him as mad but does not name him. He appears in both Alice novels.', u'In the chapter ""A Mad Tea Party"", the Hatter asks a much-noted riddle ""why is a raven like a writing desk?"" When Alice gives up trying to figure out why, the Hatter admits ""I haven\'t the slightest idea!"".This turned out to be one of the most discussed sections of the original novel.', u""The Mad Hatter from Disney's film made semi-regular appearances in the television series Bonkers (1993)."", u'The film omits the character Knave of Hearts whose trial is prominently depicted in the original novel. Instead a trial of Alice herself is depicted in the film.', u'The March Hare appears in both Alice novels. In the second he is called Haigha.', u'When Walt Disney started working to create his film version of Alice in the 1940s, his original choice for the role was Ginger Rogers. He instead settled on child actress Kathryn Beaumont.', u'The phrase Tweedledum and Tweedledee is used to describe rivals who look and act in identical ways. The phrase is attributed to poet John Byrom (1692-1763), who used it to describe rival Baroque composers Giovanni Bononcini (1670-1747) and George Frideric Handel (1685-1759). Some theories suggest that the phrase precedes him and Byrom was merely the first to use it in writing.', u'The character March Hare is based on the phrase ""Mad as a March hare"", which itself is based on the observed behavior of the male European Hare during its breeding period. This odd behavior includes boxing at other hares, jumping vertically for seemingly no reason and generally displaying abnormal behavior. The phrase is quite old, used by several English writers in the 16th century.', u'The character of Alice, as created by Lewis Carroll, had no last name. In adaptations, pastiche works, and parodies Alice is often named ""Alice Liddel"" or variations of the name. This is based on the belief that she is a fictionalized version of Alice Pleasance Liddel (1852-1934).', u'The Disney version of Alice wears a blue balloon-shaped gown with a white pinafore apron over-top, white stockings, black Mary Jane shoes, white bloomers, and a blue hair bow. The costume has become strongly associated with the character and has influenced other depictions.', u'Besides voice acting for Alice, Kathryn Beaumont served as reference material for the Disney animators. Her acting was recorded and used by them to animate the Alice character.', u'While recording the voice of Alice, actress Kathryn Beaumont dressed as Alice to better aid her with ""getting into character"".', u""The film never received a sequel, but the Alice character was a regular in the television series House of Mouse (2001). She appears in the direct-to-video releases Mickey's Magical Christmas: Snowed in at the House of Mouse (2001) and Mickey's House of Villains (2001)."", u'While Lewis Carroll never explained who the Queen of Hearts is based on, several commentators see her as a caricature of then-reigning Queen Victoria (reigned 1837-1901). This connection has made it to some of the adaptations.', u""Already during Lewis Carrol's lifetime the character of the Queen of Hearts was confused and conflated with the Red Queen, a chess queen depicted in the second novel. The author tried to clarify their differences but several adaptations of his works chose to combine the characters into one. The Disney version of the Queen of Hearts uses some of the dialogue of the Red Queen."", u'Besides the fact that they are both fat little men, Tweedledum and Tweedledee are not described by Lewis Carroll. It was artist John Tenniel who decided to depict them as identical twins. His version has influenced most later depictions.', u'The minor character of the Executioner from the original novel is omitted in the film. Instead there are multiple card soldiers acting as executioners, all of them spades.', u""The original Alice novel names an unseen character as Mary Ann. She is the White Rabbit's housemaid and the Rabbit mistakes Alice for her."", u'Some literary critics believe that the character of the Carpenter, who seduces and eats young oysters, is a caricature of Jesus Christ. Jesus is often depicted as a carpenter, though his profession is not defined in the Gospels. However, it is unlikely creator Lewiss Carroll placed much significance in the character\'s profession. While working in writing ""The Walrus and the Carpenter"" narrative poem, Carroll was undecided whether the character would be a carpenter, a butterfly, or a baronet. He let artist John Tenniel decide which of the three would be used, and Tenniel chose the carpenter.', u'Author Lewis Carroll started working on the original Alice novel in 1862. That year, Carroll was asked to entertain the three young daughters of Henry Liddell, Vice-Chancellor of Oxford University and Dean of Christ Church). The trio consisted of 13-year-old Lorina Charlotte Liddell, 10-year-old Alice Pleasance Liddell, and 8-year-old Edith Mary Liddell. He told them a tale about a bored little girl named Alice who goes looking for an adventure. The girls loved it, and Alice Liddell asked Dodgson to write it down for her. He started working on a written version and eventually developed an entire novel.', u'The sexuality of author Lewis Carroll and how (or if) it affected his Alice novels has been a much discussed topic. Carroll enjoyed spending time with young girls, photographed them in various poses (sometimes involving partial nudity), and was generally interested in juvenile feminine beauty. Some of his biographers have suggested his interest was sexual in nature, though there is no way to confirm it.', u'The character Alice is considered to be named after Alice Pleasance Liddel (1852-1934), one of the girls that Lewis Carroll spend time with and photographed.', u'The character of Alice from the novels has been variously seen as a representation of the children of the British upper class, the British middle class, and the bourgeoisie.', u'The Hookah-Smoking Caterpillar is considered one of the most memorable characters from the original novel. He speaks in short, rather rude sentences, and asks difficult questions.', u'The Cheshire Cat from the Alice novels turns invisible and disappears at will. It inspired a Marvel Comics super villain by the codename of ""Cheshire Cat"". He can turn invisible, intangible, teleports at will and has a memorable grin.', u'The Gryphon from the novel is actually a griffin, a legendary creature with the head, talons, and wings of an eagle and the body of a lion. It is a common theme in ancient art, depicted in artifacts from Egypt, Persia, Anatolia, and Minoan Crete.', u'The minor character Pat the gardener is omitted from the film and his role is taken up by the Dodo. Pat seems to be a stereotypical Irishman in the novel as implied by his dialogue. The name is short for ""Patrick"", a Latin-derived name popular in Ireland.', u'While Walt Disney released his version of Alice in the 1950s, it was not his first inspiration from the Lewis Carrol novels. Already in the 1920s, Disney had created the Alice Comedies. In the series a live-action little girl named Alice and an animated cat named Julius have adventures in an animated landscape. The series lasted from 1923 to 1927, for a total of 57 films.', u'A scene from the original novel and its adaptations involves painting white roses with red paint to please the Queen of Hearts. Some literary critics have suggested this is a subtle reference to the Wars of the Roses (1455-1487), a series of dynastic wars for the throne of England. The red rose was a symbol of the House of Lancaster and the white rose a symbol of the rival House of York.', u'Tweedledum and Tweedledee appear in the Disney film, though they are not Wonderland characters. They appeared in the second Alice novel, ""Through the Looking-Glass"" (1871).', u'While working on his novel, Lewis Carroll developed illustrations of it. His version of Alice drew inspiration from the female figures used in paintings of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, particularly those by Dante Gabriel Rossetti and Arthur Hughes. His drawings were not used for publication.', u'Prior to the release of the Disney adaptation, the visual look most associated with the Alice character was created by artist John Tenniel. Tenniel illustrated both of the original Alice novels, with his depiction of characters based on the instructions of Lewis Carroll.', u'The original novel is called ""Alice\'s Adventures in Wonderland"" (1861). The title ""Alice in Wonderland"" derives from the original theatrical adaptation, which appeared in 1876.', u'While many actresses have played Alice since the late 19th century, only one was closely connected to creator Lewis Carroll. She was Isa Bowman (1874-1958) who started playing Alice in 1888 and befriended Carroll.', u""The minor character Bill the Lizard appears in the film. He appears twice in the original Alice novel, once using a ladder to investigate the White Rabbit's house and once as a juror in the trial of The Knave of Hearts."", u'The Dodo is a minor character in the original Alice novel. His role is expanded in the film, where he is depicted as a sea captain and appears in multiple scenes. This is partly because he takes on roles associated with other characters in the novels.', u'The Duchess, Cheshire Cat\'s apparent owner in the novel, is omitted from the Disney film. She is a relatively minor but memorable character from the novel, appearing twice in much different circumstances. Artist John Tenniel depicted her as a particularly ugly woman, though the novel does not actually describe her. Tenniel is thought to have based her looks on the painting ""The Ugly Duchess"" (c. 1513) by Quentin Matsys. It depicts a a grotesque old woman with wrinkled skin and withered breasts.', u'The character of the Gryphon from the original novel was intended to appear in the Disney film. He is depicted in some of the surviving production art, but he is omitted from the film.', u'The Mad Hatter is the most prominent human male character in the original novel. He appears in many adaptations of the Alice novels, often as the male lead.', u'The film omits the character Mock Turtle from the original novel. However, there were plans to use the character and it did appear in a Disney commercial.', u'In the early 1930s, Walt Disney had the idea of a film adaptation of the original Alice novel. There were ""storyboards and sketches"" about it but the project was shelved in 1931.', u'When Walt Disney returned to the concept following World War II, his original idea was to combine live-action and animation. He dropped the live-action idea by 1946.', u'In both the novel and the Disney adaptation, the Queen of Hearts is depicted playing croquet. However it is a Wonderland version of croquet, where the balls are live hedgehogs and the mallets are flamingos.', u'Despite her obsession with decapitations, the Queen of Hearts is not depicted as a villain in the original novel. She is however depicted as the lead villain in many of the adaptations.', u""The Disney version of the Queen of Hearts is the closest thing the film has to a villain. She appears in several media associated with the Disney Villains franchise, such as the video game Villains' Revenge (1999) where she does manage to decapitate Alice."", u'The White Rabbit is the first Wonderland character depicted in the novel and its Disney adaptation.', u'On commentary to his work, Lewis Carroll described the character of the White Rabbit as elderly, timid, feeble, and nervous. A contrast to Alice and her youth, audacity, vigor and directness.', u'In the original novel the White Rabbit seems to occupy a middle position in the Wonderland social hierarchy. He ranks below the royalty and the Duchess, treating them with excessive deference. He is a servant to royalty but has servants of his own, treating them with contempt. He tends to be pompous when dealing with characters socially inferior to him.', u'In the Disney film, the White Rabbit seems to be the least eccentric of the Wonderland characters. He has been described as the straight man, a serious character in an otherwise comedy ensemble.', u'The White Rabbit appeared in the television show House of Mouse (2001) in crossovers with many other Disney characters. His most memorable line is this confession: ""I\'m not really late, and I don\'t really have a date. I\'m a fraud!""', u'In the Disney film, the Cheshire Cat recites verses from ""Jabberwocky"", a poem by Lewis Carroll. The poem is one of Carroll\'s most popular works and precedes the Alice novels, written c. 1855. It was incorporated in the second Alice novel, ""Through the Looking-Glass"" (1871).', u'Walt Disney originally planned for the film to include a song called ""Beware the Jabberwock"", a musical rendition of the ""Jabberwocky"" verse. It was written by Don Raye and Gene de Paul, and was to be sung by Stan Freberg and Daws Butler. It was not included in the film but a demo recording survived. It has been included in Disney DVD releases since 2004.', u'The film depicts the characters the Walrus and the Carpenter, who are not Wonderland characters. They appear in the second Alice novel, ""Through the Looking-Glass"" (1871) as characters in a story within a story.', u'In the Disney version the Walrus and the Carpenter duo are reinterpreted. The Walrus is depicted as the leader of the two, an intelligent conman. The Carpenter is depicted as a dimwitted sidekick.', u'The Walrus\' seduction of the oysters in the film involves leading them ashore with a flute. This is not based on the original depiction of the character. It is likely derived from the ""Pied Piper of Hamelin"", a tale about a musician who lures children away with his magic pipe.', u'Tweedledum and Tweedledee are not creations of Lewis Carroll. They are traditional nursery rhyme characters. They first appeared in print c. 1805, though the work they appeared in is attributed to by then-long deceased poet John Byrom (1692-1763).', u'The characters most associated with the Queen of Hearts are a large group of unnamed playing cards who act as her gardeners, servants, soldiers, and guards. They appear in the Disney film and many other adaptations.', u""Dinah, Alice's pet cat, is the mother of kittens Kitty and Snowdrop in the second Alice novel. Kitty is identified with the Red Queen and Snowdrop with the White Queen."", u'The live flowers appear in the film though they are not Wonderland characters. They appeared in the second Alice novel, ""Through the Looking-Glass"" (1871). They are voiced by Lucille Bliss, Queenie Leonard, Doris Lloyd, Marni Nixon, and Norma Zimmer.', u'The Bread-and-Butterfly is a minor character from ""Through the Looking-Glass"" (1871). It is an insect with wings made of bread and butter. It is depicted in the film.', u'The Rocking-Horse-Fly is a minor character from ""Through the Looking-Glass"" (1871). It is an insect with the body of a rocking-horse. It is depicted in the film.', u'Despite the popularity and commercial success of the two Alice novels, author Lewis Carroll never worked on a third one. He continued his literary work with narrative poem ""The Hunting of the Snark"" (1876), the shortened version ""The Nursery ""Alice"" "" (1890), and two-volume fantasy novel ""Sylvie and Bruno"" (1889, 1893). While some of them have a fan following of their own, none matched the success or influence of the Alice novels.', u""In the early 1930s, Walt Disney first worked on an Alice in Wonderland film adaptation. At the time he purchased the rights to John Tenniel's original illustrations of the novels. His choice of a protagonist for the aborted film project was Mary Pickford."", u'In 1938, Walt Disney decided to revive the Alice in Wonderland film project. He registered the title ""Alice in Wonderland"" with Motion Picture Association of America and hired storyboard artist Al Perkins and art director David S. Hall to develop the story and concept art for the film. The project was aborted because it run into several problems. The art designs of Perkins closely followed John Tenniel\'s original illustrations of the novels, but proved difficult to animate. The script of Hall turned out to be too grotesque and dark for use in a children\'s film. Finally, the amount of work needed to produce the film and the associated financial cost were deemed too high.', u""The concept art of the film was provided by artist Mary Blair (1911-1978) who also worked in several other Disney animated films of the 1940s and 1950s. Her art for the film used bold and unreal colors, and was much different than John Tenniel's original illustrations. Walt liked the concept and used it. Art and animation historians have credited Blair with introducing Modernist art to the Disney films."", u'Before settling on Kathryn Beaumont as the lead actress for Alice, Walt Disney considered hiring Lisa Davis and Luana Patten. Both actresses worked with Disney in other film projects.', u""The script of the film initially included a scene set in the Duchess' household and would feature all the associated characters. The scene was scrapped for pacing reasons."", u'The character of the White Knight from the second Alice novel was intended to have his own scene in the film. He would be a source of advice for Alice, but Walt Disney felt the character needed to learn her lessons by her own.', u'The songwriters for the film created over 30 songs for use in the film, their duration varying from a few minutes to a few seconds. Several were left unused but the film still contained more songs than any previous Disney film.', u'In Star Trek\'s ""Shore Leave"", Dr. McCoy encounters a White Rabbit and an Alice on an amusement park planet where one\'s thoughts are brought to life. Both characters are dressed as they appear in the Disney animated feature.', u'The species of the character Pat the gardener is not clearly identified. Various readers and scholars identify him with either of two otherwise unnamed characters of the novel, a guinea pig and an ape. Pat is depicted as an Irishman and the Irish were often depicted as apes or ape-like in Victorian art. The implication is racist.', u'The novel ""Alice\'s Adventures in Wonderland"" (1861) has been in the public domain since 1907. This has allowed for multiple unrelated depictions of the characters in art, literature, and film.', u'While the phrase ""grinning like a Cheshire cat"" was not recorded prior to the 18th century, its origin is possibly older. Carvings of grinning cats appear in churches of both Cheshire and Yorkshire. Some date to the Tudor period (1485-1603).', u'The Dodo is named after the dodo (Raphus cucullatus), a species of flightless birds native to the island of Mauritius. The species went extinct in the 17th century and remains one of the most famous extinct species known. It is the first species whose extinction is blamed on humans. When humans moved to the island they brought cats with them and rats escaped from their ships. The animals killed the young birds and ate the eggs.', u'The character of the Mad Hatter in its various incarnations tends to wear a top hat.', u'The King of Hearts seems to be a king consort, husband to the reigning queen.', u'The figure of the King of Hearts derives from the playing card King of Hearts. The card derives from French playing decks and was apparently based on Charlemagne.', u'The character Knave of Hearts is based on an alternative name for the playing card Jack of Hearts. The ""knave"" is an English term for a male servant of royalty. In French decks this card is named after \xc9tienne de Vignolles (1390-1443), a French military commander of the Hundred Years\' War.', u'The film omits the character Mouse from the original novel. He is most notable in the novel for telling the story of the Fury, famous for the phrase: ""I\'ll be judge, I\'ll be jury,"" Said cunning old Fury: ""I\'ll try the whole cause, and condemn you to death.""\'', u""Kathryn Beaumont was approached to play Alice after 'Walt Disney' (I) (qv was impressed with her performance as Penelope Peabody in On an Island with You (1948)."", u'The Queen of Hearts is the apparent ruler of Wonderland. She appears in the original novel and many adaptations. She is a personification of blind fury who decrees death sentences at the slightest offense. Her favorite execution method is decapitation.', u'The Queen of Hearts is based on the playing card Queen of Hearts. The card derives from French playing decks and is named after Judith, a non-royal Biblical figure. Judith is the heroine of the Book of Judith, which is included in the Septuagint version of the Bible and its translations. She is best known for decapitating enemy general Holofernes, a scene often appearing in art.', u'The White Rabbit is best remembered for repeatedly exclaiming that he is late, though it is never clarified to what date, event or activity he is late for.', u'Some of the earliest works by Lewis Carroll, including the poem ""Jabberwocky"", were introduced in the self-published periodical Mischmasch (1855-1862). The entire work has been collected and reprinted since the 1930s.', u'The original novel was called ""Alice\'s Adventures in Wonderland"" (1865) but that was not always the intended name. The title used by Lewis Carroll in his unprinted manuscript ""Alice\'s Adventures Under Ground"". Prior to publication other titles were considered but rejected, including the misleading ""Alice Among the Fairies"" (though no fairies appear in the novel) and the vague ""Alice\'s Golden Hour"".', u'Multiple scenes and characters from the novels were considered for inclusion. They were kept out to shorten the duration of the film and improve the pacing.', u'The character of Jabberwock/Jabberwock was originally going to be used in the film and the production crew had to decide what the monster looked like. The character was a comical looking dragon-like beast with bells and factory whistles on his head. The scene involving it was scrapped and the character never appeared.', u""The film underperformed at the box office and was considered among Disney's flops. Various reasons have been cited, with Walt Disney himself blaming the failure on the character of Alice herself who was not sympathetic enough. The film later became a cult classic, a box office hit in theatrical re-releases, and was critically re-evaluated. It is often ranked among the best animated films."", u'The song ""Beyond the Laughing Sky"" was intended to serve as the first song for Alice. It was one of the ones dropped from the final version of the film. It was later reworked into ""The Second Star to the Right"" and served as the title song for Peter Pan (1953).', u'The title song ""Alice in Wonderland"" was composed by Sammy Fain, with its lyrics written by Bob Hilliard. It was later used by jazz pianist Dave Brubeck and has went on to become a jazz standard.', u'For the Japanese release of the film, a new theme song was composed. It was sung by singer Izumi Yukimura.', u'The film was received negatively by Lewis Carroll fans, British film and literary critics who accused Disney of ""Americanizing"" a great work of English literature.', u'Along with other Disney animated film characters, the Alice characters have been adapted to the Disney comics. They were rarely protagonists themselves but have had crossovers with multiple other characters and at times play individual roles in non-Alice related stories. For example, the Mad Hatter has a part in the Mickey Mouse story ""The Blot\'s Double Mystery"" (1955) and the Cheshire Cat appears in the crossover story ""Paperin Fracassa"" (1967) whose lead character is Donald Duck.', u'In addition to providing the voice, Kathryn Beaumont also served as the Disney animators\' live-action model for Alice. The live-action reference scenes were filmed on a Disney Studios soundstage, with Beaumont wearing an ""Alice"" dress. For the scene where the giant Alice is stuck in the White Rabbit\'s house, the stage technicians at Disney built a scale model house, and had Beaumont sit inside it. But animator Eric Larson said they needed to see how Alice\'s body moved when she was inside the house, in order to animate her properly. So the stage technicians rebuilt the house as a ""frame house"" with transparent walls, so the animators could study how Beaumont moved while inside it.', u'As of 2016, Kathryn Beaumont is the only credited actor in this film who is still living.', u'Sterling Holloway (The Cheshire Cat) previously played the Frog in Alice in Wonderland (1933).', u'The character Queen of Hearts is pictured on one of ten USA nondenominated commemorative postage stamps celebrating ""Disney Villains"", issued as a pane of 20 stamps on 15 July 2017. The set was issued in a single sheet of 20 stamps. The price of each stamp on day of issue was 49\xa2. The other villains depicted in this issue are: The Evil Queen from Lumikki ja seitsem\xe4n k\xe4\xe4pi\xf6t\xe4 (1937), Honest John (Pinocchio (1940)), Lady Tremaine (Tuhkimo (1950)), Captain Hook (Peter Pan (1953)), Maleficient (Sleeping Beauty (1959)), Cruella De Ville (101 Dalmatians (1961)), Ursula (The Little Mermaid (1989)), Gaston (Beauty and the Beast (1991)), and Scar (The Lion King (1994)).', u'The minor character ""Mad Hatterbot"" from the television series Futurama (1999) is based on the Mad Hatter.', u'The Alice character and the Disney version often appear in pornography. An adult Alice is notably featured in erotic graphic novel ""Lost Girls"" (1991-1992) by Alan Moore. She is featured alongside Wendy Darling and Dorothy Gale, though these characters debuted in the 1900s, not the 1860s.', u'The Alice novels by Lewis Carroll leave the family and social class background of Alice uncertain. Her parents are not mentioned. Known member of her household include a significantly older sister, an elderly nurse, and a governess who serves as her main teacher. Based on these few details, on her educated speech, dress, and surroundings, various scholars have tried to deduce which social class she represents.', u'The comic book character Agamotto from Marvel Comics, a magical entity in the Doctor Strange series, has been depicted in the form of the Hookah-Smoking Caterpillar from the Alice novels.', u'The grinning Cheshire Cat is one of the most memorable characters in the original Alice novel and its adaptation. Actually the cat is not an original creation of Lewis Carroll. It is based on the idiomatic phrase he/she ""grins like a Cheshire cat"" which was recorded in print by a 1788 dictionary.', u'The Hookah depicted in the original Alice novel and its adaptations is a device for vaporizing and smoking flavored tobacco. It is Iranian in origin and from there spread to India and the Ottoman Empire. The Ottomans called it ""nargile"".', u'Lewis Carroll possibly based certain characteristics and phrased of the Cheshire Cat on theologian Edward Bouverie Pusey (1800-1882), whose last name suggests the term ""pussy"". Pusey was a family friend of Carroll and one of his teachers.', u'The Cheshire Cat and derived characters appear relatively often in Japanese manga and anime. For example the Pok\xe9mon characters Gengar, a type of ghost Pok\xe9mon, have a grin reminiscent of the Chesire Cat, and similar mischief making abilities.', u""The Cheshire Cat's name derives from the traditional county of Cheshire in England. The name of the county is Anglo-Saxon in origin. Lewis Carroll himself was born in Cheshire and spend most of his childhood there."", u'A theory suggests that that the phrase ""mad as a hatter"" may precede the 19th century. It associates the phrase with Roger Crab (1621-1680), an English eccentric whose various professions probably included creating hats.', u'The character Mock Turtle from the original novel is a chimera-like creature with parts from multiple animals.

Joyce was captured by British troops after the war. Despite never being granted British citizenship the British exploited a technicality (Joyce had previously been incorrectly issued a British passport) in order to try him for the crime of high treason.

In particular, the cartoon begins with a publicized non-aggression pact between two enemy factions. While members play at being friends, most continue the feud in covert ways. Frierson suggests this was a reference to the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact (August 1939), the non-aggression pact between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. Contemporaries were already suspecting it would not last.', u'The cartoon features a brief scene featuring a white rabbit, wearing a gas mask, shaking hands with a skunk.
