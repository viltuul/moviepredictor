Renowned stage actor Mark Rylance, was playing convicted Soviet spy Rudolf Abel, a character far removed from that of the sweet, but simple giant depicted in the film. While Spielberg was aware of Rylance\'s profound range as an actor, and in fact had been following his career for some time, something else clicked that day. ""Mark would go into complete character transformation when the camera was rolling,"" said Spielberg, ""and while he is one of the greatest stage actors ever, it was the Mark in between takes that really touched my heart. It was then that I knew he could do anything."" Spielberg continued, ""I could have made \'The BFG\' with actors on oversized sets using a digital blend, but I wanted the giants to look beyond human. The only way I could capture magic with the giants was to animate them based on the performances of the actors I was casting and have the animation be super-photo-realistic.""', u'Halfway through the movie, there is a scene which transitions from the eye of the giant, to a sunset, with the BFG walking towards it. This scene is actually a scene from the animated The BFG (1987) which has been unedited.', u""In 2009, DreamWorks Pictures entered into a long term, 30-picture negotiation with The Walt Disney Company, which the films will be released through Disney's Touchstone Pictures banner. While The BFG was originally going to be distributed through Touchstone, Disney decided to join production as a co-producer and co-financier, and switched the film to a Walt Disney Pictures release instead, citing on the original story's magic and heartwarming appeal. DreamWorks Pictures is not to be confused with the more well-known DreamWorks Animation; the two were formerly sister companies until they split in 2004 while retaining the rights to share the name and logo. As such, to avoid viewer confusion, the DreamWorks name and logo will not be credited on release prints and on ads; instead they will be replaced by those of Steven Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment."", u""Rather than capturing the bones of the performances separately and then merging the human and digital performances in post-production, the filmmakers chose to enlist the support of Weta Digital's Joe Letteri and his talented team of artists to devise an entirely new process that would be as close to live-action shooting as possible. As a result, production was a hybrid style of filmmaking using a blend of live action and performance capture techniques to bring the story's fantastical characters to life, all on real sets that were built specifically for the film."", u'A children\'s promotional leaflet for the movie suggests ""whenever any member of your family has a dream, encourage him or her to write it down and put it in the Dream Jar. Then at the end of each month, read the dreams aloud with the whole family"".', u""This movie marks the first produced cinema movie screenplay written by Melissa Mathison in almost twenty years. Mathison's last filmed script had been for Martin Scorsese's Kundun (1997) around nineteen years earlier. In between, Mathison is credited for the character of E.T. [See: E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982)] in the video-game Universal Studios Theme Parks Adventure (2001)."", u'For the film, director Steven Spielberg relied on Simulcam, an idea originally created by director James Cameron for Avatar (2009). Simulcam is the process of combining real world actors and sets with actors and sets that are computer-generated. Weta Digital\'s Joe Letteri explains: ""With Simulcam, we can pre-record a performance and then play it back through the camera monitor so that the camera operators could actually see the virtual performance unfolding in real time as they\'re photographing the live-action scene. By combining the two, they\'re able to make decisions and frame and actually even cue actions based on what\'s happening in the virtual world."" This new process afforded director Spielberg the opportunity to film actors in performance capture suits acting on the same set with the film\'s human characters, and it was especially important to Spielberg that actress Ruby Barnhill and actor Mark Rylance have interaction with one another.', u'The movie\'s source novel ""The BFG"" is dedicated to the book\'s author Roald Dahl\'s late daughter, Olivia, who passed away due to measles encephalitis at the age seven in 1962, twenty years before the book was first published in 1982.', u'Two of the BFG\'s dream jars are labeled ""I is naked at work"" and ""I is naked at wedding"", respectively.', u'According to The New Yorker magazine: ""During principal photography, in Vancouver, in the spring of 2015, Melissa Mathison was on the set every day, handing cards to the director with the day\'s scene on it - a practice carried over from E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982) that encouraged Steven Spielberg to detach from the script in its entirety.

While the author passed away in 1990 at the age of 74, the producers forged a relationship with his widow and had many conversations about how important the book was to Dahl and whether or not a movie was even realistic. Producer Kathleen Kennedy said: ""We talked a lot about whether it would be better as animation or live action, because at the time, none of the technology that we were talking about using even existed.""', u'When Roald Dahl wrote ""The BFG"", he named the lead child character Sophie after his granddaughter, actress and model Sophie Dahl.

So I\'ve been very fortunate to bookend our relationship with two stories that came from her heart."" Spielberg continues: ""I have not had a chance to mourn Melissa, because she\'s been so vibrant and real to me, in the cutting room, on the scoring stage, in the dubbing room - she\'s just always been there with me, so because of that, it\'s going to be hard when I have to let The BFG go, because then I have to let Melissa go, too.""', u'According to the Wonderful World of Roald Dahl website, ""Gobblefunk"" can be defined as""Roald Dahl\'s own language"".

Dahl created stories to tell his children and grandchildren, but was always hesitant to write any of them down, something with which the director could relate.

As a result, Carter and his co-production designer Rob Stromberg went to great lengths to accommodate three different worlds for three different-sized beings, in some cases duplicating sets three times over. There was a set for the 50-foot tall giants, for the 24-foot tall BFG, and a huge, over-scale set with big over-scale props for Sophie to make her look small. Fortunately, actor Mark Rylance had a tremendous amount of faith in the story and, actress Ruby Barnhill, a tremendous amount of faith in her imagination. Carter added: ""Between Mark\'s belief in story and how to perform the story, and Ruby\'s belief that everything is possible, both of those actors made this world of evolved technology disappear so that they could give each other the most authentic performances.""', u'The first Disney film directed by Steven Spielberg.

The height range of the giants in Giant Country ranged between twenty-four and fifty-two-feet with the BFG\'s brothers all standing between thirty-nine and fifty-two feet. The height of source novelist Roald Dahl at his peak stood six feet six inches-tall, Dahl being somewhat of a giant in real life himself. Moreover, publicity for The BFG (2016) declares that its lead actor Mark Rylance is ""a giant himself"".

Weta Digital\'s Joe Letteri explains: ""When [actor] Mark Rylance is on set and performing, he\'s performing in a facsimile of his real world, in his cave with his fireplace and table, his chair and the boat in which he sleeps.""', u'One of the roles of production design is to create environments and places that evoke something about, not only the story-line and the characters, but the themes of the film as well. As such, the production crafted worlds within worlds where director Steven Spielberg could create his vision for Roald Dahl\'s source story. Production Designer Rick Carter said: ""Steven started off with a very intimate process, just a computer and a few people in a room. And then we came to a big space and expanded it while still trying to keep it as intimate as possible.""', u'For Executive Producer Kathleen Kennedy, the sets conveyed a sense of timelessness, which was very much in synch with Roald Dahl\'s original story. Kennedy said: ""Dahl was telling a universal story, and, one of the key reasons that we built these sets is to give the film that slightly other worldly quality. You might recognize a street corner or a building or notice an architectural style that feel familiar, but you can\'t quite pinpoint it, and that\'s what allows you to escape into this kind of fairy-tale world.""', u'Production Designer Rick Carter said of the film\'s director Steven Spielberg: ""With The BFG, Steven is able to return to the innocence he had explored earlier in his career. He\'s a grandfather now . . . he\'s both the BFG and the innocent young person. But this is a story that taps into everybody\'s childhood experience of things that come out of the dark and what those things are about.""', u'Just as the filmmakers anticipated, screenwriter Melissa Mathison took a personal approach to the material, maintaining the relationship between the scrappy orphan and the word-jumbly giant as they took on their big adventure from Roald Dahl\'s source novel. Mathison said: ""My imagination was invested in the two of them. Everything needed to be centered on their relationship."" Director Steven Spielberg said: ""Melissa took Dahl\'s book and did the most extraordinary but faithful translation, with a magic only Melissa possesses.""', u""Both of the movie's writers, screenwriter Melissa Mathison and source novelist Roald Dahl, had passed away when the movie debuted in cinemas in 2016, Dahl in 1990 and Mathison towards the end of the production period of this film during late 2015."", u'Of the props and prop-work in the film, director Steven Spielberg said: ""There was so much love put into every prop. So much thought put into something as simple as the BFG\'s bag, which [production designer] Rick Carter created to resemble a big doctor\'s bag. Of course the bag carries his dreams, but the dreams are kind of like medicine for the kids who are in need of them, and the bag was stitched together in a Frankensteinian way to almost resemble a patchwork quilt.""', u'Producers Frank Marshall and Kathleen Kennedy were familiar with many of source author Roald Dahl\'s other books like ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,"" ""James and the Giant Peach"" and ""Matilda"" which have sold over 200 million copies worldwide, but neither had read ""The BFG.""

It wasn\'t until a chance encounter on the set of Milk Money (1994) in 1993 that Kennedy read ""The BFG"" (1982) novel for herself and realized that Steven Spielberg, their longtime friend, colleague and collaborator, was just the person to appreciate the scope, playfulness and sheer invention of the book.', u'On the casting of Sophie, director Steven Spielberg said that they ""have discovered a wonderful Sophie in Ruby Barnhill"".', u""Fifteenth of sixteen cinema movie collaborations of features films directed by Steven Spielberg and lensed by cinematographer Janusz Kaminski who is also shooting one of Spielberg's next films, Ready Player One (2018)."", u'Crew personnel who worked on both The BFG and E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982) include director Steven Spielberg, screenwriter Melissa Mathison, composer John Williams, music and sound scoring mixer and recordist Shawn Murphy who worked on the 2002 re-recording of ""E.T."", vfx plate supervisor Ryan Cook who worked as a development CG artist for ILM on the 2002 special version of ""E.T."", as well as producers Frank Marshall and Kathleen Kennedy.', u'A tagline for the film states ""From the human beans that created E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982)"". ""Human beans"" is BFG source novelist Roald Dahl-speak that pretty obviously means ""human beings"" as defined also in the BFG Glossary in a children\'s promotional pamphlet for the picture. Five personnel who worked on The BFG worked on E.T. when it was filming during late 1981. They were director Steven Spielberg, screenwriter Melissa Mathison, composer John Williams, and producers Frank Marshall and Kathleen Kennedy.', u'The age of London orphan girl Sophie was ten years old.', u'""The BFG"" is enormously popular around the world, and to date has been published in 41 languages. It was also Roald Dahl\'s own favorite of all his stories. While the author passed away in 1990 at the age of 74, the producers forged a relationship with his widow and) had many conversations about how important the book was to Dahl and whether or not a movie was even realistic. ""We talked a lot about whether it would be better as animation or live action, because at the time, none of the technology that we were talking about using even existed,"" explains Kennedy.', u'First cinema movie version of Roald Dahl\'s source novel ""The BFG"" (1982). The first and earlier version, The BFG (1987), was made for video and television.', u'Producer Kathleen Kennedy first acquired the rights to the literary property of Roald Dahl\'s source novel ""The BFG"" (1982) in 1991. This was about two years after the animated version The BFG (1987) of the story had been first broadcast and about nine years after Dahl\'s book ""The BFG"" had been first published in 1982.', u'First live-action 3D feature film of director Steven Spielberg, whose previous only other feature film available in 3D, his first ever in 3D, The Adventures of Tintin (2011), was a CGI animated animation feature film.', u'The 24-foot-tall BFG (Big Friendly Giant) character played by Mark Rylance also appears in another Roald Dahl novel - Danny, the Champion of the World (1975) - which has also been filmed [See: Roald Dahl\'s Danny the Champion of the World (1989)]. Dahl\'s novel ""The BFG"" was then first published around seven years later in 1982.', u'Publicity for this picture states that the film brings together ""the talents of three of the world\'s greatest storytellers"". They are Roald Dahl, Steven Spielberg, and Walt Disney [the latter who is the creator of the film\'s studio that produced The BFG].', u""Rather than capturing the bones of the performances separately and then merging the human and digital performances in post-production, the filmmakers chose to enlist the support of Weta Digital's Joe Letteri and his talented team of artists to devise an entirely new process that would be as close to live-action shooting as possible. As a result, production on The BFG (2016) was a hybrid style of filmmaking using a blend of live action and performance capture techniques to bring the story's fantastical characters to life, all on real sets that were built specifically for the film."", u'The producers needed a screenwriter to spin Roald Dahl\'s 1982 novel of ""The BFG"" into a full-length screenplay-someone with a special skill and instinct for children\'s stories, and for that they turned to friend and colleague Melissa Mathison, who had penned E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982) for director Steven Spielberg. Executive Producer Kathleen Kennedy said: ""Melissa was the first and only writer we thought of. Her gifts as a writer and her particular sensibility were essential to bringing Dahl\'s visionary tale to life.""', u'The meaning of this major motion picture\'s title ""The BFG"" is that it is an acronym for ""The Big Friendly Giant"" who is portrayed in the movie by English actor Mark Rylance.', u'Roald Dahl\'s ""The BFG"" (The Big Friendly Giant) was first published in 1982 and has been enchanting readers of all ages ever since. Dahl\'s books, which also include ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,"" ""James and the Giant Peach"", and ""Matilda,"" are currently available in fifty-eight languages and have sold over two hundred million copies worldwide. Originally created as a bedtime story, ""The BFG"" (1982) was Dahl\'s own favorite of all his stories. Director Steven Spielberg said: ""It was very important for us to be loyal to the language and the great writer Melissa Mathison, who also wrote E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982), wrote The BFG.', u'The producers needed a screenwriter to spin Roald Dahl\'s book into a full-length screenplay-someone with a special skill and instinct for children\'s stories, and for that they turned to friend and colleague Melissa Mathison.

So they were thrilled when the studio green lit the film in the spring of 2015, making it the first Walt Disney Studio film ever to be directed by Steven Spielberg. Kathleen Kennedy said: ""There\'s a level of expectation that fans and audiences of Walt Disney movies expect. And we\'re proud to have the film attached to such a studio.""', u'Director Steven Spielberg said of Mark Rylance\'s being cast in the movie at the time of casting: ""Mark Rylance is a transformational actor. I am excited and thrilled that Mark will be making this journey with us to Giant Country. Everything about his career so far is about making the courageous choice and I\'m honoured he has chosen The BFG as his next big screen performance.""', u'On D.O.P (director of photography) Janusz Kaminski, producer Frank Marshall said: ""Working with Janusz has been great because there\'s a real richness to his photography, and that really comes out in what you see on screen. He helped guide a lot of what we were doing to create this world and to really marry the two so it becomes one world as you photographically move between the two.""', u""This film's screenwriter Melissa Mathison, who wrote E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982) for Steven Spielberg, also wrote uncredited the first draft screenplay for Spielberg's family / childrens' film The Adventures of Tintin (2011)."", u""The announcement of most of the movie's cast was announced on 13th April 2015.

It's Spielberg's twelfth if one counts War of the Worlds (2005), his two Jurassic Park films, and his five Indiana Jones movies."", u""This represents the third time Steven Spielberg has directed a film that is also an acronym.

Sophie is a strong girl who does not take no for an answer and is not intimidated by someone who is six-times bigger than her, and the character is similar to strong females who are at the center of many Walt Disney films. A strong young female protagonist has appeared in two of director Steven Spielberg\'s earlier family / childrens\' movies, Dakota Fanning in War of the Worlds (2005) and Drew Barrymore in E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982).', u'The filmmakers envisioned an entirely new approach to expand the horizons of storytelling by bridging the gap between the fullness and life of live action and the limitless possibilities of contemporary digital technologies. It was a process that would be engineered solely through the lens of exactly what Steven Spielberg needed to tell the story.', u""Fourth family / children's feature film directed by director Steven Spielberg following Hook (1991), The Adventures of Tintin (2011), and E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982)."", u'Director Steven Spielberg said that screenwriter Melissa Mathison\'s earliest drafts for ""The BFG were ""experiential"". Spielberg told The New Yorker: ""It was very poetic, and the poetry of Melissa\'s writing, and the poetry of Roald Dahl\'s words, were kind of propelled forward just by Sophie becoming less afraid of BFG and BFG becoming more respectful of Sophie, but there wasn\'t really a plot engine.""', u""First family / children's film directed by Steven Spielberg to have an acronym title since E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982). A.I. Artificial Intelligence (2001) was a film made for a more adult and mature audiences, as reflected in many of the movie's classification certifications, though it did receive PG ratings in some territories, as has The BFG."", u'Once the film\'s screenplay script was completed, screenwriter Melissa Mathison would remain involved with the film throughout principal photography. Director Steven Spielberg occasionally needs to make changes to the script while filming and wants the writer\'s voice there to bring the characters alive. Spielberg said: ""Melissa was there on the \'E.T.\' [E.T._] set every day, and every day on The BFG (2016). So I\'ve been very fortunate to bookend our relationship with two stories that came from her heart."" Spielberg continues: ""I have not had a chance to mourn Melissa, because she\'s been so vibrant and real to me, in the cutting room, on the scoring stage, in the dubbing room - she\'s just always been there with me, so because of that, it\'s going to be hard when I have to let The BFG (2016) go, because then I have to let Melissa go, too.""', u'On D.O.P (director of photography\' Janusz Kaminski, producer Frank Marshall said: ""Working with Janusz has been great because there\'s a real richness to his photography, and that really comes out in what you see on screen.

Renowned stage actor Mark Rylance, was playing convicted Soviet spy Rudolf Ivanovich Abel, a character far removed from that of the sweet, but simple giant depicted in The BFG. While Spielberg was aware of Rylance\'s profound range as an actor, and in fact had been following his career for some time, something else clicked that day. ""Mark would go into complete character transformation when the camera was rolling,"" said Spielberg, ""and while he is one of the greatest stage actors ever, it was the Mark in between takes that really touched my heart. It was then that I knew he could do anything."" Spielberg continued, ""I could have made \'The BFG\' with actors on oversized sets using a digital blend, but I wanted the giants to look beyond human. The only way I could capture magic with the giants was to animate them based on the performances of the actors I was casting and have the animation be super-photo-realistic.""', u'The filmmakers were all in agreement that The BFG felt like a hybrid between a classic Disney film and a movie from Amblin Entertainment, the latter being the production company that Steven Spielberg, Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall founded in 1981.

Donovan makes arguments to the Supreme Court about Rudolf Ivanovich Abel, the actual words used in the dialogue for this movie were the same as the arguments presented to the U.S. Supreme Court.', u""Rudolf Ivanovich Abel's seemingly incongruous accent was accurate. Abel was born in Newcastle-upon-Tyne to Russian parents and spent some of his early years in Scotland. He returned to Moscow in his late teens, but never lost his accent when speaking English."", u'Soviet agent Rudolf Ivanovich Abel received coded messages from his KGB handlers that were hidden inside a hollow U.S. nickel. The FBI first became aware of Abel\'s activities in 1953, when a Soviet agent mistakenly used one of the hollow nickels to buy a newspaper. The Brooklyn newsboy who got the nickel thought it felt too light. He dropped the nickel on the sidewalk, and it popped open, revealing a piece of microfilm with a coded message inside. FBI cryptologists were unable to crack the code until 1957, when a KGB defector, Reino H\xe4yh\xe4nen, gave them the key to deciphering the code, and gave up Rudolph Abel. The ""Hollow Nickel Case"" was also dramatized in The FBI Story (1959).', u'Director Steven Spielberg had a good laugh when he read the line in the screenplay of a policeman taunting Donovan that he had been in ""the third wave on Normandy."" Spielberg joked to Tom Hanks that he ought to answer: ""I was in the first"", a reference to Saving Private Ryan (1998), also directed by Spielberg.', u'For the scene outside the courtroom, the photographers were initially instructed to put their used flashbulbs, which are extremely hot to the touch, in their pockets. One of the background actors happened to be the historian of the New York Press Photographers Association. He told Executive Producer and 1st Assistant Director Adam Somner that, at the time, photographers would have ejected the bulbs onto the floor. After several takes, noticing the bulbs strewn across the floor, Steven Spielberg decided to shoot the low-angle view of the principals walking through them.', u'According to Steven Spielberg in a press release for the movie, Gregory Peck came after the story in 1965. Alec Guinness agreed to play Rudolf Ivanovich Abel, Peck would play James B. Donovan, and Stirling Silliphant would write the script. MGM declined to make the movie at the time. It was 1965, Cold War tensions were high, and MGM was reluctant to get into the politics of the story.', u'For six days of shooting on the Glienicke Bridge and surrounding streets, the production firm had to pay 10,552.13 EUR (about $11,428.96 U.S.) to the local district, the city of Potsdam, and the German government. It took one person five months to get the all the necessary permits from 23 different agencies.', u'Arnold Spielberg, the father of Steven Spielberg, actually went on a foreign exchange to Russia as an engineer during the cold war, right after Francis Gary Powers was shot down, when there was tremendous fear and hostility between the two nations. Arnold Spielberg recalled seeing Russian citizens line up to look at Powers\' crashed gear and ""see what America did."" When they saw the American engineers, they pointed at them and said, ""Look what your country is doing to us,"" demonstrating the fear and rage the nations felt towards each other.', u'In an interview with the International Spy Museum, the son of Francis Gary Powers, Francis Gary Powers, Jr., indicated that his father was not told to commit suicide if shot down, unlike the depiction in the movie. Instead, it was given as an option in case physical torture had been involved, allowing the pilots to use a poison pin if the pilots chose to commit suicide. He also indicated that the Soviets found the pin on a third strip search, but Powers warned them not to touch it. The Soviets tried the pin on a dog and the dog died a few moments later.', u'Principal photography on ""Bridge of Spies"" began in September 2014, and shot for twelve weeks on locations in Germany, Poland, and New York City, including many of the places where the events in the story took place. European production kicked off in Berlin where the prisoner exchange of Rudolf Ivanovich Abel and Francis Gary Powers took place. To film the crucial Berlin Wall sequences, production also traveled to Wroclaw, Poland, which more accurately resembles the East Berlin of 1961, than Berlin itself.', u'Tom Hanks was 59 when he played James B. Donovan in this movie. The real Donovan was in his 40s when the events of the film took place, and later passed away from a heart attack at age 53.', u'When James B. Donovan and CIA Agent Hoffman are in West Berlin, they walk past a German cinema where one of the movies playing is ""Eins, Zwei, Drei."" It\'s the German title of the American Cold War comedy One, Two, Three (1961), which was directed by Billy Wilder. In the film, James Cagney plays an American business executive working in West Berlin who, like Donovan, must cross over into East Berlin and negotiate with Soviet officials for the release of a political prisoner.', u""The first Steven Spielberg film not to be scored by John Williams since The Color Purple (1985). In March 2015, after Williams' schedule was interrupted by a minor health issue which reportedly has since been corrected, Thomas Newman stepped in to replace him as composer, and Williams went on to score Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens (2015). Both Williams and Newman received Academy Award nominations for Best Musical Score that year."", u""Steven Spielberg cast Mark Rylance in the movie after watching his Tony Award-winning performance in Twelfth Night which was Rylance's third Tony Award."", u'Fourth theatrical feature film collaboration of Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg as director. The pair previously worked together on (in chronological order): Saving Private Ryan (1998), Catch Me If You Can (2002), and The Terminal (2004).', u""In an interview with the International Spy Museum, Francis Gary Powers, Jr. recounted how, when he heard about the making of the movie, he reached out to the producers, about concerns on getting the details of his father's history correct, given the information that has been revealed, subsequent to the 1980s. He was invited to meet Steven Spielberg, Tom Hanks, and actor Austin Stowell, the latter of whom plays his father Francis Gary Powers in the movie. He then introduced them to Joe Murphy, his father's co-pilot, who also helped identify him on the bridge, where the spy trade occurred."", u'The Russian phrase ""stoikiy muzhik"" literally translates to ""persistent peasant;"" ""stoikiy"" means persistent, rigid, or uncompromising, and ""muzhik"" is a slang term for peasant. Abel\'s translation of the phrase as ""standing man"" is appropriate on a metaphorical level.', u'Just before the U-2 takes off, its auxiliary landing gear falls off the right wing. The U-2 was designed to be as light as possible to give it maximum range and altitude capability. Its auxiliary landing gear, or ""pogos"", were designed to fall away from its wings on takeoff to minimize weight. The plane lands with its nose and tail gear in an inline ""bicycle"" configuration, and its wingtips are equipped with titanium skid plates to prevent damage.', u'At the beginning of the film, Rudolf Ivanovich Abel is painting a self-portrait, the scene is based on Norman Rockwell\'s ""Triple Self-portrait"". Steven Spielberg and George Lucas are both big collectors of Rockwell\'s work.', u'During the scene at dinner, James B. Donovan uses the line, ""Every man deserves a defense"". This line was also used in another Tom Hanks movie, The Green Mile (1999).', u'London-based playwright and television writer Matt Charman stumbled upon a footnote in a biography of John F. Kennedy that referenced an American lawyer who Kennedy had sent to Cuba to negotiate the release of 1,113 prisoners. Some quick research led to James Donovan, a successful insurance claims lawyer from Brooklyn. Several years earlier, Donovan had defended a Soviet agent accused of espionage during the Cold War. Even though he specialized in insurance law, and had not practiced criminal law for some time, he was asked to negotiate one of the most high-profile prisoner exchanges in history. With little knowledge of the inner-workings of the film industry, Charman flew to Hollywood in the hopes of convincing a studio to green-light a film based on Donovan\'s story. While Donovan\'s role was not well-known in the annals of Cold War history, Charman pitched to DreamWorks Pictures a gripping tale of an idealistic man navigating the world of national security and espionage. ""When I heard the story, it knocked my socks off,"" says producer Kristie Macosko Krieger, who was a co-producer on Steven Spielberg\'s Lincoln (2012), and is based at DreamWorks. Krieger said, ""Not many people know the story of James Donovan, and what he accomplished during this period of U.S. history, but it sounded like something that was right up Steven\'s alley.""', u'The subway Donovan rides home is the only remaining N.Y.C. Transit R11 subway car that was part of an order of ten built in 1949. It was called the ""million dollar train"" because each of the ten cars cost over $100,000. The interior in the film is from a 1964/65 rebuild of the car, not the one it had when the story took place in 1961.', u""This is the second collaboration between Steven Spielberg, Joel Coen and Ethan Coen. Spielberg was the Executive Producer for the Coen Brothers' remake True Grit (2010)."", u""The rock band U2 took their name from the U-2 plane which is featured in this movie. Lead singer Bono's daughter Eve Hewson plays Carol Donovan."", u'Rudolf Ivanovich Abel, whose real name was Vilyam Fisher, died in 1971, and was rarely photographed or interviewed while alive. According to Mark Rylance, ""We don\'t really know all that much about him, other than the fact that he received and passed on messages at various drop sites throughout New York City using a hollow coin. He was, what you call, a sleeper spy. Abel had been in the United States for several years before he began these clandestine activities, and he wasn\'t the chief organizer of the spy-ring, he just carried out the mission. But when he was caught, the U.S. government made him out to be a little more important than he actually was.""', u'The car used by the East German negotiator is a Volvo P1800 early production model, from 1961-1963 called the ""cow-horn"" bumper and similar to the one used by Roger Moore in The Saint (1962). Even the speedometer that is shown, is correct.', u'The French debut was scheduled for November 15, 2015. After several terrorist attacks hit Paris on November 13th, leaving more than 120 people dead, the premiere was cancelled.', u'In 1964, James B. Donovan wrote an account of the classic Cold War spy incident, of which this film is the subject. It was entitled: ""Strangers on a Bridge: The Case of Colonel Abel (Rudolf Ivanovich Abel) and Francis Gary Powers"".', u'The CIA offered crack fighter pilot Francis Gary Powers $30,000 a year ($265,758.43 in 2017 dollars) to fly its top-secret bird.', u'The movie was filmed under the working title of ""St. James Place"".', u'The crash of Francis Gary Powers\'s U-2 spy plane was shot via a large screen at Flughafen Tempelhof Airport, where production designer Adam Stockhausen and his team built a replica of the U-2\'s cockpit on a motion base which was used for all the close-ups of Powers in his aircraft. According to producer Kristie Macosko Krieger, ""it was amazing to be able to shoot with these old airplanes at beautiful locations like Tempelhof where the events in the story actually took place . . . you can\'t re-create stuff like that.""', u'When lawyer James B. Donovan and CIA Agent Hoffman meet over breakfast to discuss including Frederic L. Pryor in the prisoner swap, an instrumental version of Nat \'King\' Cole\'s ""Unforgettable"" plays in the background. Donovan is try to convince Hoffman that Pryor should not be forgotten.', u'The film cast includes two Oscar winners: Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance ; and two Oscar nominees: Alan Alda and Amy Ryan.', u'Co-screenwriters, Joel Coen and Ethan Coen, immediately dove in after Matt Charman\'s first couple of screenplay drafts, immersing themselves in the language of the period and incorporating Tom Hanks\' persona into the character of James Donovan, expertly interweaving this remarkable experience in his life into a powerful story that captured the essence of the man. Steven Spielberg said: ""Joel and Ethan got us very, very deep into the characters. They really instilled a sense of irony and a little bit of absurd humor, not absurd in the sense that movies can take license and be absurd, but that real life is absurd. They are great observers of real life, as we all know from their great august body of work, and were able to bring that to the story."" One theme woven throughout the texture and framework of the Coen Brothers\' screenplay, which struck a chord with Spielberg, was the notion that spies looked like everyone else. Spielberg explained: ""It wasn\'t just shadows and light and spies in a stereotypical way, but it was spies as people that we wouldn\'t even think twice about, we wouldn\'t even notice them to begin with, let alone figure out that they\'re here to do a mission against our national security. Between Matt Charman and Joel (Coen) and Ethan Coen, I was in the hands of three wonderful storytellers.""', u'Costume Designer Kasia Walicka-Maimone\'s research showed that, for the most part, people dressed up in the late 1950s and 1960s. She said: ""Men and women were more formally-attired, meaning suits and hats for men and dresses, suits and skirts for women. But the men\'s suits were not at all like those worn today. They were constructed in another manner, an older tradition, with a different body shape, a different sleeve, a different fit to the trousers and a thicker weave in the fabric.""', u'The movie was partially filmed at Beale Air Force Base in California.', u'Finding a place to shoot the train scene in contemporary Berlin, Germany had initially presented a challenge for the filmmakers, as the Friedrichstrasse Station standing today is more modern than the one that existed during the Cold War. But Adam Stockhausen came up with a solution, and re-created the station using a hulking, rusty overpass of S-Bahn tracks near another S-Bahn station that ran along a crumbling brick wall.', u'27th theatrical film directed by Steven Spielberg.', u'To film crucial scenes in the story which took place at the Berlin Wall, the production moved to Wroclaw, Poland. Wroclaw (pronounced Vrotzwuav) was in a state of disrepair, the result of economic hardship and years of neglect, but similar in look to that of a city ravaged by war. The city had been part of Germany, before the borders were redrawn, and was called Breslau at the time, so all the architecture was German in style. According to producer Marc Platt, ""many of the buildings had not been touched since the war. . . There were literally bullet holes in some of the buildings.""', u'Steven Spielberg said of regular collaborator John Williams not being able to score this movie: ""It was devastating to me, because John was having this medical thing, and he\'s okay now, thank God, but we have always worked together, and after forty-two years of collaboration, not to work with him was almost incomprehensible. At one point, my response was not to have any music at all . . . it would just come out of record players and radios and those kinds of things. But then I knew that there were parts of this film that really would benefit from a score, and I didn\'t think twice when I knew it wasn\'t going to be John . . . the first person I thought of was Tom Newman.""', u'Steven Spielberg has often tackled seminal historical events throughout his career. A history enthusiast, his knowledge of the Cold War dates back to childhood, when his father told stories of the deep-seated feelings of animosity and distrust that existed between the U.S. and Soviet Union, stories he still remembers today. ""My father had gone to Russia, during the Cold War, on a foreign exchange, right after Francis Gary Powers was shot down,"" remembered Spielberg. ""My dad and three other associates from General Electric stood in line because they were putting Powers\' flight suit, helmet and the remains of the U-2 on display for everybody in Russia to see what America had done. He was about an hour away from the front of the line when a couple of Russian military officials approached my dad and asked for their passports, saw they were Americans, and got them to the head of the line, not to convenience them, because after they got to the head of the line, this Russian pointed to the U-2 and then pointed to my dad and his friends and said, \'Look what your country is doing to us,\' which he repeated angrily several times before handing back their passports."" ""I never forgot that story,"" he says, ""and because of that, I never forgot what happened to Francis Gary Powers.""', u'Based on the caliber of filmmakers already in place, Tom Hanks was inclined to come on board without even reading the script. Once he did, he knew it had the potential to become one of the most exciting projects in his career. Hanks said, ""This subject matter has always fascinated me, because of the area, and because of the time. I knew that Francis Gary Powers was a U-2 pilot who was shot down by the Soviet Union, that it was a huge international incident and that there was a trade that got him back, but I didn\'t know any of the details or who James Donovan was."" Hanks continued, ""I love reading history and finding out something brand new, particularly about a subject that I think I\'m well versed in, and when that happens, man, it\'s like winning the lottery.""', u""As of November 2015, this is (unadjusted for inflation) Steven Spielberg's lowest-grossing film since M\xfcnchen (2005) ."", u'Mark Rylance is the second of two actors to win an Academy Award for acting in a film by Steven Spielberg. The first was Daniel Day-Lewis for Lincoln (2012).', u'Producer Marc Platt, was familiar with James Donovan\'s story and was also aware of director Steven Spielberg\'s interest in the Cold War and history in general, and felt it was ideally suited for the director\'s sensibilities. Platt said: ""As a filmmaker, Steven has studied some great iconic characters and can re-create history in an extraordinarily cinematic way. He\'s the perfect filmmaker to tell a story like this."" And they were both right. The story was part legal drama, part thriller and part historical epic, and Spielberg was riveted. But it was the character of James Donovan that he found most appealing. The story of a well-respected lawyer living the life of a typical family man in the \'50s who took on a dangerous assignment and prevailed through sheer instinct and conviction of principle, had enormous cinematic potential.', u'Scenes of James B. Donovan trying to talk his way past East German guards at the Friedrichstrasse Checkpoint, so he won\'t miss his appointment at the Soviet Embassy with Wolfgang Vogel, were filmed at Berlin\'s City Center. Friedrichstrasse, better known as Checkpoint Charlie, is the best-known border crossing point between East Berlin and West Berlin. ""Everyone assumes the only way into East Berlin was through Checkpoint Charlie, but that wasn\'t the case,"" production designer Adam Stockhausen pointed out. ""You could actually take the S-Bahn past the border and get off at the Friedrichstrasse Station, but when you got off you\'d still have to go through a checkpoint to enter the East.""', u'The end result on-screen conveys not only the terror of the Berlin Wall, but the confusion as well. Steven Spielberg said: ""The Berlin Wall was really symbolic, but it didn\'t look like San Quentin, or Alcatraz, or some other huge federal penitentiary. The walls were actually fairly easy to scale, you just didn\'t dare do it. When we shot those scenes, I looked at the Wall and thought to myself, \'Did this really happen? Was Berlin really divided like this?\' It brought back a time in my life when walls started to go up all over the world, most of them invisible walls, but walls nonetheless."" Tom Hanks added: ""It was terrifying, and it felt so permanent, too. What production designer Adam Stockhausen was able to do with the wall, finding that perfect crossroads in the city of Breslau in Poland that matched up so well to the architecture of the time, was truly amazing.""', u'After the Donovan household is shot up, a disgruntled police officer confronts James B. Donovan and says, ""I was in the third wave on Omaha Beach."" In Saving Private Ryan (1998), Tom Hanks\'s character landed on Omaha Beach.', u'The film was nominated for six Academy Award nominations including Best Picture, Best Achievement in Sound Mixing, Best Original Screenplay, Best Achievement in Production Design, and Best Achievement in Music Written for Motion Pictures - Original Score, and won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for Mark Rylance.', u""The historic Glienicke Bridge in Berlin, Germany, where the actual exchange of Rudolf Ivanovich Abel for Francis Gary Powers took place, was the setting of the story's historic climax. The Bridge spans the Havel River and is near Wannsee, where the Wannsee Conference with Adolf Eichmann and the other architects of the Holocaust took place (See: Conspiracy (2001), The Final Solution: The Wannsee Conference (1984), and The Wannsee Conference (1992)). During the war, the Glienicke Bridge separated East Berlin and West Berlin. At the time Bridge of Spies (2015) was made, it connects the Brandenburg section of Berlin to the suburb of Potsdam."", u'One incident in particular which stood out for the cast involved the inadvertent smashing on the ground of used flashbulbs from the press photographers. It was after the reading of Rudolf Ivanovich Abel\'s (Mark Rylance\'s) verdict in court, when the media were surging around James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks), his wife Mary Donovan (Amy Ryan), and Thomas Watters, Jr. (Alan Alda). Mark Rylance explained: ""Steven came up with the idea of using these discarded bulbs littering the floor as a way to heighten the drama when Mary, who\'s being overwhelmed by the media, steps back, and her high heel crunches one of the bulbs."" Amy Ryan added: ""Steven had this idea in an instant. I saw him get down onto the floor at the level of the camera so he could see exactly what the shot, the smashing of the bulbs, would look like. We learn a great deal about Mary, because of the way Steven filmed this scene, me included."" Tom Hanks added: ""It ends up making a comment on the waste. It wasn\'t even in the script, it wasn\'t even a cool shot, but it actually added to the tapestry of the moment, and Steven comes up with stuff like that because that\'s the way he thinks. Steven thinks in cinematic terms. His ability to tell important story moments just by what he does with the camera, is the reason he\'s Steven Spielberg. He\'s done it again and again and again, and all you can do is stand back and watch.""', u'Steven Spielberg had been very much interested in directing a James Bond spy film in his earlier years, and did have talks with then Bond franchise producer Albert R. Broccoli about directing For Your Eyes Only (1981), but Broccoli told him he only wanted British directors to helm the Bond series. Shortly afterwards, George Lucas offered Spielberg an iconic hero of his own, in the form of Indiana Jones and Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981).', u""Tom Hanks' character James B. Donovan makes a clumsy, but valiant attempt to speak German. In reality, Hanks has some German ancestry on his father's side of the family."", u'Steven Spielberg said: ""As a youngster growing up in the 50s and 60s, I had a tremendous amount of awareness of what was happening during the Cold War, but I didn\'t know anything about the exchange of Rudolf Ivanovich Abel for Francis Gary Powers. I knew about Powers, because, growing up, everyone had heard that his U-2 spy plane had been shot down, and that he had been put on public display at a very public trial, but the story kind of ended with a spectacular shoot down. I didn\'t realize that something had happened subsequent to his capture, which was this very backroom exchange, this spy swap between Abel, a Soviet spy, and Powers, the American spy pilot. So there was a lot to this story that really pulled me in.""', u'Steven Spielberg was clear with Thomas Newman, in that he was not expecting him to deliver a John Williams score. Newman said: ""Steven has a very fundamental, almost primal, relationship with John Williams, and a very successful one at that, but he encouraged me to write music that reflected my aesthetic as opposed to trying to match John\'s. I\'ve known John forever through my family, but I always knew I didn\'t want to end up being a third-rate John Williams, because his style has been such a defining part of what movie music is."" While John Williams was unavailable to score the film, due to a minor health issue, which was corrected, Williams did go on to write the score for Spielberg\'s next film, The BFG (2016).""', u'It was important for Steven Spielberg that James B. Donovan (played by Tom Hanks) remained the story\'s focus, and the fact that there was no music at the beginning of the film, helped to reinforce the story, and accentuate the dialogue. Editor Michael Kahn explained: ""By not having music there, it allowed us to really get a sense for what Donovan\'s life is like, and it worked out beautifully, because we got to know him quickly, because we were able to hear all the dialogue so clearly.""', u'The real Rudolf Ivanovich Abel was, in fact, a very-skilled artist, something Steven Spielberg chose to focus on in the film\'s opening scene. Spielberg explained: ""How we see ourselves and how other people see us, what we hide in order for others to discover something hidden . . . that was all part of this idea I had to start the film on Mark Rylance\'s face playing Rudolf Abel, then to pull back and discover that he\'s actually studying his face because he\'s doing a self-portrait."" Spielberg continued: ""It gave me a kind of stylistic theme to continue to think about, like how do we see ourselves . . . is that actually who we are when we paint what we look like, or is that our idea of somebody we want others to see, which is what spies do. They have to go into disguise, and blend in, and actually disappear, to be successful. I just thought that was a good way of starting the story on the right thematic note.""', u'The U-2 spy plane was nicknamed ""The Dragon Lady"".', u'Reunites Tom Hanks and Peter McRobbie after their appearance in Big (1988).', u""John Williams returned to score Steven Spielberg's next film The BFG (2016).

Donovan (Tom Hanks) works. Alda said: ""My character sort of edges Donovan out of his job in order to protect the firm. Watters just wants to protect the firm and prevent Donovan from becoming too idealistic, which was a clever way for the screenwriters to show what Donovan was up against when he agreed to take the case.""', u'Portions of the Friedrichstrasse Checkpoint were re-created in Wroclaw, Poland by production designer Adam Stockhausen and his team as well, including its iconic sign in three languages which read, ""You Are Now Leaving the American Sector"". The set was used to film the climatic sequence where Frederic L. Pryor (Will Rogers) is being escorted to the Checkpoint by Wolfgang Vogel (Sebastian Koch), among others. Marc Platt said: ""Everything about the Checkpoint Charlie set was remarkable. You felt as though you were living in that moment in time, in history."" Tom Hanks added: ""These people do work that I can\'t even begin to fathom. It all just looks like homework to me, and they always seem to be just barely operating in time to get it all done. But when you see the end result and it is so evocative that even someone like me, who knows that it is a set, still lingers on it as long as possible, that is a special talent."" Mark Rylance agreed, saying, ""the sets were all incredibly beautiful with an amazing amount of detail. As an actor, we are working among craftspeople, and just being surrounded by these people with such skill and love for what they do, is very inspiring. It is the combination of all these crafts which make a great film, and Steven leads so creatively.""', u'James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks) believes that Rudolf Ivanovich Abel (Mark Rylance) was acting honorably, but when he comes across some technicalities in the search and seizure of Abel\'s art studio and apartment, he begins to question whether Abel received due process at the time of his arrest. Producer Marc Platt explained: ""This is basically a guy from the CIA who believes that the most important thing should always be protecting the security of the country, and Donovan has a different set of principles that have to do more with his take on the Constitution . . . sort of a constitutional viewpoint versus a national security viewpoint.""', u'During the Cold War, the need to gather strategic military information from our adversaries led to the development of the U-2 spy plane by the U.S. It was a reconnaissance aircraft that flew at heights of 70,000 feet, twice the altitude of a commercial jet while the aircraft was undetectable by Soviet radar.', u""In the scene in which Tom Hanks calls his wife from a pay phone in West Berlin, one of the films shown on the marquee is Spartacus. Spartacus and Exodus were the first films to acknowledge Dalton Trumbo as screenwriter since he was blacklisted in 1947 after testifying before HUAAC. While historically accurate that Spartacus would have been released around the same time as James Donovan's negotiations in Berlin, the inclusion of the film on the marquee is a subtle nod toward the Hollywood blacklist, and American anti-communist efforts in Hollywood."", u'Fletcher Prouty, an Intelligence Community insider, has said that President Eisenhower was planning on going to Russia for peace talks, the CIA gave the Russians inside information on the U2 so the Russians could shoot it down and ruin the talks.

The project was eventually cancelled.', u'Tom Hanks was fascinated by the strong bond that develops between his character James B. Donovan and Russian spy Rudolf Ivanovich Abel. Hanks explains: ""What he developed with Rudolf Abel was, first, a very completely professional relationship as an advocate. He even says, \'I am your advocate, my job is to represent you, and bring you the best version of American justice that I can surmise, and here\'s what I think that justice needs to be,\' and he was dogged in his pursuit of that. He also developed a great personal relationship with Abel because he felt as though he was fighting for a good guy, both personally and in terms of what he stood for.""', u'The nickname of the Glienicke Bridge in Berlin in Germany is ""The Bridge of Spies"".', u'The movie was released on the thirtieth anniversary of the romantic cold war thriller White Nights (1985). One person, George Doering, is billed for both movies, both as a musician in the music department, credited as a musician for White Nights (1985) and an instrumental soloist for Bridge of Spies (2015). Both pictures also both won an Academy Award, but in different categories, Best Song for White Nights (1985) and Best Supporting Actor for Mark Rylance, for Bridge of Spies (2015).', u'Adam Stockhausen explained the film\'s production design: ""We had to work fast in \'blitz-style,\' which meant swapping out posters and signage, changing lighting fixtures and redressing everything from top to bottom.

Kristie Macosko Krieger said: ""When I stepped onto the set of Donovan\'s home for the very first time, it was like I had gone back in time to the late 50s and I was having dinner with someone\'s family. Adam Stockhausen got every little detail perfect in that house.""', u'The characters of James B. Donovan and Wolfgang Vogel share their last names with villains in an earlier Steven Spielberg film, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989).', u'As a child, the 8mm war movies Steven Spielberg made in his backyard, were often set in World War II, a recurring subject in numerous films he would one day direct. Titles ranging from Schindler\'s List (1993), Saving Private Ryan (1998), and Empire of the Sun (1987), to 1941 (1979) and the ""Indiana Jones"" films, but until now, none were set in the world of international espionage. ""I love spy movies,"" said Spielberg. ""I love John le Carr\xe9, the James Bond movies, Mad Magazine and the infamous \'Spy vs. Spy\' column that I grew up with, so spying has always been on my mind.""', u'With this film, the characters truly are the story, and James B. Donovan, an insurance lawyer who is lured into the powerful corridors of the FBI and CIA, is the heart of the story. When it came to casting the crucial role, the choice had always been obvious: one of the most iconic actors working at the time, Tom Hanks. Kristie Macosko Krieger said: ""There is no one better suited for this role than Tom Hanks. James Donovan is just an ordinary guy . . . he is like my best friend\'s dad. He was a guy who did his job and then gets thrown into this incredible international story. That just doesn\'t happen, but people think of Tom Hanks as everyman, and that\'s why he is so brilliant as James Donovan.""', u'Steven Spielberg, James B. Donovan represents the ideals of a genuinely altruistic person, someone who had the tenacity to put Rudolf Ivanovich Abel\'s defense ahead of his own comfort and safety because he truly believed that the law needed to be respected. Spielberg said: ""It brought a lot of tension to Donovan\'s family, the same kind of tension that I imagine my own dad went through when he told people he spent three weeks in the Soviet Union at a time when if you even mentioned the Soviet Union in the wrong way, you could be accused of complicity.""', u'In Brooklyn, where Rudolf Ivanovich Abel had created a simple existence for himself as a painter, Abel is captured, and doesn\'t try to hide his past. He remains tight-lipped and reveals no information about his activities in the U.S. or connections to anyone in Moscow, frustrating the FBI to no end. Says Tom Hanks: ""Abel was just a guy doing his job. He\'s a spy, and we have guys over there doing the same thing for our country. I believe that Abel was surprised to hear this argument from a man who was his advocate . . . it was not just some sort of legalistic ploy on his part, it was what he believed. It was an irrefutable fact, and that played itself out through the relationship.""', u'According to Steven Spielberg, some of the best moments in his films are accidents, either accidents of interpretation or something audiences read into, on their own. He said: ""Other times they are determined choices for which I cross my fingers that people will discover as they watch the movie, and that\'s the most satisfying thing: when you intend something and people understand what your intention was, and they\'re getting it, and they\'re liking what they\'re getting. That\'s the best reward.""', u'Rudolf Ivanovich Abel states his wife is a musician. Mark Rylance, who plays Abel, has a wife who is also a musician.', u'In the early scene of the Donovan family eating dinner together, a dish of peas and carrots is clearly visible in the same shot as James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks). ""Like peas and carrots"" is a favorite catchphrase of Hanks\' title character in Forrest Gump (1994).', u'Back in 1962, Roger Corman hired Robert Towne to write a quick screenplay based on the Francis Gary Powers incident. However, ""I Flew a Spy Plane Over Russia"" never got to be filmed.', u'Sometimes truth is stranger than fiction, and with ""this film, the incredible story of an ordinary man placed in extraordinary circumstances, it is all the more compelling because the character at the heart of the story is a real person. Because of his association with Rudolf Ivanovich Abel, James B. Donovan was subjected to a great deal of scrutiny from the media and the general public, and a source of fascination in the story for director Steven Spielberg is the notion that people often jump to conclusions and make snap judgments, which ended up helping him determine the best way to approach the story. Spielberg explained: ""We have to find the villain and find the hero in real-life stories, and so by quickly targeting and earmarking a villain, we immediately stop being mindful, or even empathetic, about the person that we deem a villain. We give all our empathy to the hero, and we give no credit and no currency to the villain. By doing that, we become very one-sided and all our tolerance goes out the window."" Spielberg continued: ""One of the things I loved about this story was that everyone you think should be wearing a black hat isn\'t necessarily wearing that hat, nor did they intend to. It doesn\'t make it easy to root for someone who is a spy against the national security of our nation . . . how could we possibly come out on the other end of this experience caring about this person in the least? But in this case we do, and that was something that made me want to get involved with the project.""', u""Abel's real name was William August Fisher. His real name was used in all court proceedings and later. The film used Abel throughout as he was known to the American public by that name."", u'Mark Rylance had nothing but praise for Tom Hanks. Rylance said: ""Tom saw me in \'Twelfth Night\' in Los Angeles in 2003 before the production was famous, and he was one of the first actors to come to it, and to come backstage afterward and talk to the cast, which was very exciting for everyone. But what surprised me the most about Tom, is that he loves to make people laugh and has this very goofy sense of humor, which immediately puts people at ease.""', u'Before filming began, Amy Ryan, who portrays Mary Donovan, had the opportunity to meet Mary\'s real-life grand-daughter. Ryan explained: ""I saw her family\'s wedding albums and vacation photos and heard firsthand stories, where I found out that Mary was born in Bay Ridge, raised in a strong Irish Catholic family, graduated from Marymount College and eventually settled down in Park Slope. Mary was proud of what her husband was doing, but she didn\'t like the attention it drew to her family, and worried that their children might be in danger.""', u'The actual Francis Gary Powers died in 1977. His son, Francis Gary Powers, Jr., was a consultant to the production, and also has a cameo in Bridge of Spies (2015) as a CIA Agent who is involved with the training of U-2 pilots, or ""DRIVERS"" as they were commonly referred to at the time.', u'Cinematographer Janusz Kaminski\'s first film with Steven Spielberg was Schindler\'s List (1993), and since that time they have worked on more than a dozen films together. According to Marc Platt: ""One can start a sentence and the other can finish it, and the result for us, as moviegoers, is to watch the film come to life, and to watch the beauty of it, the look and the feel of it, and that lies in whatever miraculously occurs between Janusz and Steven.""', u""In New York City, Manhattan's Metro Station at Broad Street was the setting for scenes of Rudolf Ivanovich Abel being tailed by the FBI, and of James B.

The movie's distribution was split between two studios and was distributed worldwide by Disney Pictures and 20th Century Fox, depending on the territory.

Donovan (Tom Hanks) must discuss Abel\'s exchange. Vogel works for the Communist government of the German Democratic Republic (GDR), which was not recognized by the American government of the U.S., but was desperately trying to become its own country. Steven Spielberg explained: ""Nationalist East Germany was actually shaking their fists at the Soviets, saying, \'I know you feed and clothe us, and provide for us, but we are not your puppets."" Donovan ends up trading Abel to two different parties: Vogel and the GDR for Frederic L. Pryor at Checkpoint Charlie and Ivan Schischkin and the Soviets for Francis Gary Powers at the Glienicke Bridge.', u'Tom Hanks said of his co-star Mark Rylance: ""What Mark brings to the role is a completely-realized self-assuredness. Mark will not take a moment and throw it completely out, and come in and completely redo it. What Mark will do instead, is construct the character in the scene that slow little motions of feint, either one way or the next, will bring a new jolt of energy to, but is still the same character he built.""', u'A challenge for Michael Kahn for this film, was determining the best way to effectively combine multiple stories involving four different characters - James B. Donovan, Francis Gary Powers, Rudolf Ivanovich Abel, and Frederic L. Pryor - and showing how they were all connected, even though they were all quite different. Kristie Macosko Krieger said: ""That\'s part of the magic of Michael Kahn and Steven\'s collaboration . . . that they are able to put those things together so that they feel seamless when you see it finished.""', u'The set for the famous cold war German crossing point of ""Checkpoint Charlie"" was created for the movie in Poland.', u'This theatrical film covers various elements and some of the same subject matter as the earlier television movie called Francis Gary Powers: The True Story of the U-2 Spy Incident (1976).', u'The last day of filming for Tom Hanks during principal photography was the integral pinnacle spy trade exchange sequence on the Glienicke Bridge set.', u'The movie\'s title shares its name with a non-fiction book by Giles Whittell, which was first published in 2010. It is titled ""Bridge of Spies: A True Story of the Cold War"".', u'Structurally the story is a study in shifting moods and environments, opening in Brooklyn in 1957 with the action eventually moving to East Berlin. Because of this, the production utilized two different crews for principal photography. There was one crew to film scenes in and around New York and a different crew for Poland and Germany, each with its own pre-production schedule, and each tasked with effectively creating their own cinematic universe that needed to remain faithful to period details.', u'A strong sense of history infused the production once filming began in Europe, as the iconic locations helped depict, in stark images, the horrors to which the East Germans were subjected, instilling a sense of respect for what these people had endured.', u""Flughafen Tempelhof Airport in the south-central section of Berlin, Germany is where the historic airlifts of 1948 and 1949 took place, and was an indispensable location. These airlifts took place when the Soviet Army closed off access to the western part of the city by all other means of transport. Planes from the U.S., Great Britain, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa, transported food and supplies to the city's inhabitants to prevent them from starving. Steven Spielberg filmed multiple scenes at Flughafen Tempelhof Airport, including the return home of both James B. Donovan and Francis Gary Powers to the U.S. inside a U.S. Army cargo transport plane. Scenes featuring actual U-2 planes, both on the ground and in the air, were shot several months later at Beale Air Force Base in Yuba County, California."", u""The Berlin Wall was in the midst of construction when James B. Donovan's story took place, and Steven Spielberg wanted the audience to see it being built on-screen as well. The first version that went up was a makeshift wall made from concrete blocks and barbed wire, which was quickly replaced with the version most recognize today with reinforced cement slabs and an enormous pipe on top, making it much more sturdy and more difficult to scale."", u'Production in Berlin, Germany coincided with the 25th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall. Even though the city of Berlin was located entirely within the Soviet portion of Germany, East Berlin was part of the Soviet Union; West Berlin was not. Residents of the city were able to go back and forth until the GDR built the Berlin Wall to separate the two cities, and entrance was only accessible at one of several check points located along the Wall.', u'For the character of Mary Donovan, costume designer Kasia Walicka-Maimone drew inspiration from Jacqueline Kennedy, and accentuated Ryan\'s look with a string of pearls, and glasses similar to ones worn by the real Mary Donovan. Kasia Walicka-Maimone said: ""We had a lot of good information about the real Mary Donovan, most of which came from Amy, including some amazing photographs from the family\'s personal collection. Looking at those photos helped us understand the essence of who this woman was. We created a lot of pieces for her, like the green coat she wears in the courtroom, which seemed to represent the era and, subliminally, provide the audience with a better feeling of that time."" Ryan said: ""She created these beautiful looks for the time period, and even though my costumes were more casual in style, each was more beautiful than the next. But the undergarments were far more constricting than what I\'m used to wearing, which, believe it or not, helped me get into character since I had to move differently.""', u'Music has always played a crucial role in Steven Spielberg\'s films, but from day one Spielberg envisioned Bridge of Spies (2015) differently. There are approximately thirty-eight minutes of music in Saving Private Ryan (1998) and about 38 to 40 minutes of music in Bridge of Spies (2015), and there is no music in this film for around the first twenty minutes. Spielberg explained: ""Many of my films are dependent on score, sometimes even dependent on wall-to-wall scoring, but I didn\'t feel \'Bridge of Spies\' was that way, the same way I didn\'t feel that \'Private Ryan\' needed wall-to-wall music.""', u'Molding a film about the courageous exploits of a family man turned Cold War spy negotiator presented editor Michael Kahn with a unique challenge. Kahn explained: ""It was a big dialogue piece. He (Steven Spielberg) shot it in more of a conventional way, where dialogue was key. He wanted the audience to really be involved in what was being said, and to really think about things, so we didn\'t cut it like an action film. In fact, Tom Hanks\' and Mark Rylance\'s performances were so scintillating at some points, that it was difficult to cut away at all.""', u'Production designer Adam Stockhausen and his department built approximately three hundred yards of the Berlin Wall at different phases of its construction with the same materials and same dimensions as the original. It is when the American student Frederic L. Pryor (Will Rogers) comes into the story, that the audience first sees the Berlin Wall. Pryor, while visiting a professor in East Berlin, whose daughter also happens to be his girlfriend, has an unfortunate encounter with the East German border guards, who arrest him as he tries to return to West Germany.

Donovan\'s powerful story without overpowering it. Thomas Newman said: ""This is an American story - the difficulty was figuring out the best way to represent America in a way that didn\'t sugar-coat anything, while representing the ideals of Donovan at the same time. What it ended up boiling down to, for me, was simple family values, a sense of what it means to be an American in the most idealized sense of the word.""

Newman explained: ""In terms of that color, I didn\'t want the music to say, \'Okay, here is Russia and here is America, and Russia is going to be represented by deep male voices,\' but I did want to kind of push that as a means of compelling the story.""', u'Michael Kahn is one of director Steven Spielberg\'s long-time collaborators, a relationship that dates back to Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977). According to Tom Hanks: ""Matt Charman realized that there was something fantastic there, and wrote it up, and then the Coens (Joel Coen and Ethan Coen) end up sprinkling their substantial amount of fairy dust on it. Some of those are in the text, but the timing and the composition is all Steven and Michael. Thank God they have the shorthand that they do, because no one can write that stuff.""', u'Donovan is not just a simple lawyer from a firm that specializes in insurance claims. Prior to joining this law firm he was the general counsel to the OSS, the precursor to the CIA.', u'Screenwriter Matt Charman went to London to start writing, and within six weeks delivered a thought-provoking, well-crafted script that generated a wonderful feeling of suspense between the multiple stories. Steven Spielberg said: ""Matt did a good job of connecting the Powers story with the Abel/Donovan story."" It was a clever, and important, juxtaposition because Powers was technically doing the same thing Abel was arrested for, only from the air, and Charman knew that, structurally, he needed to make all of the different stories speak to one another. Platt agreed, saying, ""Matt did a fantastic job, and once he was finished, we brought his draft to the Coen brothers, who write with a tone which is real, yet has a particular edge to it, which was perfect for this story.""', u'Crucial was finding an actor to play a captured Soviet spy, with divergent loyalties and surprising depth, who was interesting enough that the audience would be able to feel his humanity and thoughtfulness . . . and someone who could hold his own opposite Tom Hanks, as well. Steven Spielberg has always appreciated actors who portray their characters in an honest and truthful way, and as a result, was drawn to Mark Rylance. For years, he had been following the career of the English actor, and was eager to work with him, just looking for the right part. Spielberg said: ""Mark is one of the most extraordinary actors working anywhere. I saw him in \'Twelfth Night\', and that pretty much cinched it for me.""', u'For Mark Rylance, an actor best known for his acclaimed stage work in such productions as ""Jerusalem"" and ""Boeing-Boeing"" and the then recent PBS miniseries Wolf Hall (2015), the opportunity to work with Steven Spielberg was incredibly humbling. And while Rudolf Ivanovich Abel was a divisive figure, his selfless patriotism earns the respect and admiration of James Donovan, which Rylance found tremendously appealing. Rylance also found the story moving and incredibly entertaining, and he appreciated the fact that it had the potential to really cause people to think. Rylance said: ""This is a film about a man who does the right thing at the right time in the right place, and it\'s an important story.""', u'Amy Ryan, was especially thrilled to have the opportunity to work with Tom Hanks, who plays her husband James B. Donovan in the film. Ryan found Hanks generous, both in spirit and energy. Ryan said: ""I was very impressed with the amount of enthusiasm he was able to bring to each scene, and he\'s had so much experience as an actor, that I tried to listen and observe as much as I could,"" she says. ""In addition to all the technical sides of knowing where the camera is going to be and where the lights are, he is still able to inhabit the scene so fully and truthfully . . . that is an amazing skill."" And for Hanks, the feeling was mutual. He said: ""Working with Amy was amazing . . . I was always thinking that it looked as if she was hardly doing anything, and yet she was doing everything all at the same time.""', u""Francis Gary Powers, Jr., who has a cameo, and was a consultant to the production, and is the son of Francis Gary Powers, according to the film's DVD documentaries, is the Founder and Chairman Emeritus of the Cold War Museum."", u'Marc Platt explained of the production: ""Producing this film was interesting because it was almost like we were making two separate films, which is representative of the extraordinary journey that James Donovan goes on.

We knew we wanted the audience to go on a journey, and we shot, for the most part, in continuity. Because of time constraints we had a few scheduling issues with some of the crew we normally work with, which allowed us to discover some amazing people that we had never used before. We had Adam Stockhausen, who is a brilliant production designer; Kasia Walicka-Maimone, our costume designer; and the composer Thomas Newman, and those three really helped infuse the film with vitality.""', u'Tom Hanks said of filming this movie about the Cold War: ""There was not a single day when we didn\'t show up on the set for the first time and think, holy cow, this is not just an odd little re-creation . . . this is a three-dimensional, authentic, holographic representation of what it was.""', u'Renowned for his ability to capture emotional details amidst stunning visuals, Janusz Kaminski\'s primary goal, is establishing a cinematic grammar in which to tell the story. Fortunately, with ""Bridge of Spies,"" the outstanding locations, set dressing and costumes provided countless opportunities for the camera.', u'Tom Hanks said of Janusz Kaminski: ""What I love about working with Janusz, is that I can understand very quickly the stakes that he\'s going for.

Tom Hanks said: ""The costumes were off the scale, which is really saying something. Anyone can go to a costume house and rent a bunch of stuff, but they still end up looking like rental costumes. I don\'t know how she did it, but Kasia (Kasia Walicka-Maimone) was always coming up with fresh ideas, everything down to the waitress uniforms in Berlin\'s Hilton Hotel . . . but that\'s what artists do.""', u'When shooting exteriors, the period costumes worn by extras helped reinforce the sense that these scenes, despite a vibrant immediacy in the present, were happening in the somewhat distant, yet recognizable, past. Some scenes featured over three hundred extras, everything from spectators and reporters in court, to subway passengers and pedestrians on the streets, and on cold days, required dressing them not only in clothing, but with appropriate accessories, like hats, scarves, gloves, and overcoats as well.', u'Kasia Walicka-Maimone said: ""We needed to effectively represent the period and the colors of the period, so (production designer) Adam (Stockhausen) and I mapped out the balance of colors to figure out how everything was going to match. We absorb as much of the vocabulary from that time period as we can, choose whatever is needed for the particular frame of the film, and then construct those realities so they are strong enough to resonate the period, while not overwhelming the story.""', u""Equally key was ensuring all the wardrobe colors were authentic for the specific time period. Scenes set in New York City featured clothing that was much more color-driven, representing the successful, commercial world of America in the 1950s, with women wearing predominantly green, maroon and yellow, and men, brown, gray and navy. In Berlin, colors were scarce and muted when used, as most everything was black and/or dull gray to reflect the city's dismal atmosphere at the time."", u""When Thomas Newman's music score kicks in after about twenty minutes into the movie, the music is understated and brilliant in its simplicity. As James B. Donovan becomes more involved with the CIA, the score escalates from simple piano to full orchestration, a subtle difference, but one which Steven Spielberg believed would add some emotional weight to the friendship between Rudolf Ivanovich Abel and James B. Donovan."", u'Thomas Newman said of his music for the film: ""It\'s pretty compelling. The sounds of New York City really set up a sense of anticipation about what was going to happen to Abel. Francis Gary Powers\' plane crash is also brilliantly done without music, and it\'s just thrilling that it\'s all sound.""', u'Thomas Newman said of working with Steven Spielberg: ""When Steven and I would get together to discuss the music, he was always looking at the movie as someone who was trying to enjoy it and trying to relate to it as opposed to someone who had intentions. So he would watch and listen and he would react, which was ultimately very rewarding, because I felt like I found my own voice and that the voice was accepted by Steven.""', u'Tom Hanks adds, ""When you show up on Steven\'s set, it has already been built, not only physically, but deep inside Steven\'s head. Your job is to do exactly what he wants you to do, but he also expects you to add in all the little things he expects you to come up with. He has the film cut in his head long before we even get to the set. He reads the screenplay thousands and thousands of times, over and over and over again, so he knows what he\'s going to be doing, cinematically, five weeks from now.""', u'The picture was a tremendous learning experience for Amy Ryan. She said: ""Steven is so enthusiastic about what he\'s doing, that it\'s infectious. There were times when I would be observing him at work, and all of a sudden his eyes would get big as saucers, almost as if he was this twelve year-old boy still making films in his backyard.""', u'Of Tom Hanks, Steven Spielberg and Kristie Macosko Krieger said respectively: ""Tom is the perfect collaborator. He will try anything and he\'s got a thousand ideas, and is open to a thousand ideas from other people. He\'s this incredibly creative vessel that just wants to figure things out in a more original way"" (Spielberg), and """"Watching Tom and Steven work is such a joy, such a pleasure. They are both really masters at what they do, and you can see it. They have such fluidity and a sense of ease with each other, which really brings out the best in one another."" (Krieger).', u'Amy Ryan signed on as James B. Donovan\'s supportive but strong-willed wife, Mary. In discussing what attracted her to the project, Ryan said: ""Most screenplays take ten or fifteen pages before you get a sense of who the characters really are, but we find out that James Donovan is a fast-talking lawyer in the first few pages. Plus, I liked the fact that this woman, Mary Donovan, wasn\'t just a \'Yes dear, of course dear\' kind of wife. She had things of substance to say and really good, strong, smart opinions about the world in which her husband was stepping foot into, and I found that genuinely appealing.""', u'Steven Spielberg also puts a tremendous amount of focus on the narrative. While some directors are focused on the feelings of the actors or the beauty of the images, he\'s more concerned about where the audience\'s imagination is. Kristie Macosko Krieger said: ""What\'s great about Steven, is that he truly loves being on set. In the mornings when we get to work I\'ll say, \'Is there anything else you\'d rather be doing in the world right now?\' and he says, \'No,\' and it\'s true. He knows he is incredibly lucky to do what he does.""', u'Steven Spielberg and Martin Scorsese held a Q&A discussion together to talk about Bridge of Spies (2015).', u""Amy Ryan and Domenick Lombardozzi both appeared in HBO's The Wire (2002)."", u""The film's story was inspired by true events."", u'The fevered years of the Cold War, a war that involved information, not combat, was a war where words were the ultimate weapon. It was a time when anti-Communist propaganda, ""Duck and Cover"" educational videos, and the media\'s sensationalist coverage of events like the Rosenberg trial bred fear and hatred across the country . . . . hatred stemming from fear of the unknown. No one was safe, and it was an especially dangerous time to be in the headlines for defending a Russian spy...A dramatic thriller set against the backdrop of a series of historic events, ""Bridge of Spies"" is the story of James B. Donovan played by Tom Hanks, an insurance claims lawyer from Brooklyn who finds himself thrust into the center of the Cold War when the CIA enlists his support to negotiate the release of a captured American U-2 pilot.', u'Once a finished screenplay was in hand, plans to make the film quickly accelerated. A stellar production team was soon in place, including: two-time Academy Award winner Janusz Kaminski as director of photography; Oscar winner Adam Stockhausen as production designer; Kasia Walicka-Maimone as costume designer; three time Academy Award winner Michael Kahn A.C.E. as editor; and twelve time Oscar nominee Thomas Newman as music composer. Producer Kristie Macosko Krieger said: ""Steven loves authenticity and we assembled an amazing group of artists to work with him . . . some of whom we had worked with before, and some who were new to us.""', u""Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg share a unique, creative relationship, one that elevates any film with which they're involved. Previous collaborations prior to this have included Saving Private Ryan (1998), Catch Me If You Can (2002), and The Terminal (2004), as well as the Emmy and Golden Globe winning HBO mini-series Band of Brothers (2001), which is based on Stephen Ambrose's book, as well as the Emmy winning television mini-series The Pacific (2010), both television productions of which, they were producers."", u'Steven Spielberg said of the James B. Donovan character: ""James Donovan was what you would call a stand-up kind of guy, someone who stands up for what he believes in, which, in his case, is justice for all, regardless of what side of the Iron Curtain you are on. He was only interested in the letter of the law. And Tom\'s own morality and his own sense of equality and fairness, and the fact that he does such good things in the world by wisely using his celebrity, made him the perfect fit.""', u'Marc Platt said of Tom Hanks: ""Tom is a history buff. You can tell this from some of the great miniseries and films he\'s produced, and acted in. But he also has a particular interest in this period. The Cold War and East/West Berlin politics is something he knows a good deal about.""', u'Amy Ryan\'s biggest challenge was making her character, Mary Donovan, a woman in the midst of extremely-trying circumstances, believable. Marc Platt said: ""Amy\'s portrayal of Mary has us rooting for her, but we also feel her conflict over wanting to protect her family. Her husband\'s involvement with the case brings the family some danger, and causes friends to sort of drop away, and you feel the tug-of-war within her to want to protect and love her husband and do what he thinks is right, and yet to protect her family at the same time, and you love her for that conflict.""', u'With the story\'s protagonists in place, the filmmakers set out to cast the supporting roles integral to James B. Donovan\'s story, consulting with New York City-based casting director Ellen Lewis. Steven Spielberg said: ""There have been many times when I wanted to use Ellen but she was working with Scorsese, and this was an opportunity where Marty wasn\'t working, and Ellen was available, which was great, because I wanted to use predominantly stage actors.""', u'Theater actor Scott Shepherd, who received Obie Awards for his performances in ""Gatz"" and ""Poor Theater"", and has appeared on-screen in Side Effects (2013), was cast as Hoffman, the shrewd CIA Operations Officer. The CIA was looking for a private citizen, like James B. Donovan, to negotiate the swap in East Berlin, so it wouldn\'t be governments talking, and it is Hoffman who secures Donovan\'s participation in the dangerous mission. But the two men soon go head-to-head, as Shepherd expects Donovan to value national security over attorney-client privilege.', u'Fourth movie where Tom Hanks has a love interest, played by actress who is last named ""Ryan"". Hanks has previously starred in three films with actress Meg Ryan as his romantic partner, they being (in chronological order), Joe Versus the Volcano (1990), Sleepless in Seattle (1993), and You\'ve Got Mail (1998). In Bridge of Spies (2015), Amy Ryan plays Mary Donovan, the wife of James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks).', u""The picture featured two actors in acting roles who have also directed theatrical films as well. They are Tom Hanks, who directed Larry Crowne (2011) and That Thing You Do! (1996), and Alan Alda, who directed The Four Seasons (1981), Sweet Liberty (1986), A New Life (1988), and Betsy's Wedding (1990)."", u'The movie\'s opening prologue reads: ""1957. The height of the cold war. The United States (of America) and the Soviet Union fear each other\'s nuclear capabilities - and intentions. Both sides deploy spies - and hunt for them."" The following title card then is added to this text: ""Inspired by true events.""', u'One of two espionage movies that debuted in 2015, which had music scores by Thomas Newman. The other one is Spectre (2015).', u""For the most part, this picture was shot in chronological order, according to Kristie Macosko Krieger on one of the film's DVD documentaries."", u'The movie features four ""Making of"" behind-the-scenes documentaries available on some DVDs. They are: U-2 Spy Plane (2016), Berlin 1961: Re-Creating the Divide (2016), A Case of the Cold War: Bridge of Spies (2016), and Spy Swap : Looking Back on the Final Act (2016).', u'Thomas Newman replaced John Williams. Regular Steven Spielberg scorist Williams was originally attached to score the film, but had to withdraw, due to health reasons.', u'When James B. Donovan accepts the assignment, CIA Agent Hoffman stresses that he will be on his own. Neither the U.S., nor the Soviet government can have any involvement in the operation. The German Democratic Republic (GDR) will broker the exchange directly with him. Hanks said: ""Donovan had given a vociferous, authentic and passion-filled defense for this Soviet spy who was arrested, which was then tabbed by the other side to help facilitate an exchange that would get one spy back to the Soviet Union and another one back to the U.S.""', u'The name of the law firm that Thomas Watters, Jr. and James B. Donovan worked for was ""Watters, Cowan & Donovan"".', u'Steven Spielberg recommended Austin Stowell for the role of Francis Gary Powers after watching his dailies from Public Morals (2015), a period cop television drama Executively Produced by Spielberg, in which Stowell had a starring role, and which premiered in the same year as Bridge of Spies (2015). Stowell, had been most recently seen in the highly-acclaimed film Whiplash (2014), and plays Francis Gary Powers in Bridge of Spies (2015), the young Air Force pilot who joins the CIA to fly covert missions in a U-2 spy plane, and is subsequently shot down over the Soviet Union. There, he is imprisoned and subjected to solitary confinement and sleep deprivation, eventually suffering the humiliation of a very public Moscow show trial.', u'Michael Gor, who played the Bond villain Vladimir Popov in Die Another Day (2002), signed on as the enigmatic Ivan Schischkin, a Soviet official who calls himself an assistant secretary in the Soviet East Embassy in East Berlin, but who is, in fact, a high-level KGB operative, with whom Donovan must negotiate. Will Rogers came on board as Frederic L. Pryor, an American student arrested in East Berlin, who James B. Donovan learns about, while he is in East Berlin to negotiate the of release of Francis Gary Powers, and insists must also be part of the exchange.', u'Intelligence agencies featured in this espionage drama, which is based on a real life Cold War story, include the FBI, the CIA, and the KGB.', u'While the cast and crew were being assembled, the filmmakers were simultaneously deciding where to shoot the film, hoping to use many of the very places where the events in the story actually took place. After scouting locations in the U.S. and Europe, they settled on New York City; Berlin, Germany; and Wroclaw, Poland.', u""Principal photography kicked off in September 2014 in Manhattan, and over the next month the production made the most of the city's diverse architectural styles and its geographically-adjacent boroughs. Cameras manned by Janusz Kaminski first rolled in lower Manhattan at Wall Street, filming exteriors of James B. Donovan on the steps of the Federal Courthouse at Foley Square."", u'In midtown Manhattan, the offices of the New York Bar Association, located in a classic historical landmark at 44th Street, provided the ideal setting for James B. Donovan\'s law firm, ""Watters, Cowan & Donovan"", instilling a sense of old-world money and prestige.', u'Multiple shoots in Brooklyn were conducted, on locations in Flatbush and Brooklyn Heights, as the borough still features period buildings, suitable for the Cold War period of the picture.', u""It was in Ditmas Park, a residential area made up of quaint houses, situated on peaceful, tree-lined streets, that Adam Stockhausen found the ideal location for the Donovans' house: a beautiful, freestanding Victorian house full of charm and period detail, with a front porch and small backyard, which helped convey James B. Donovan's strong connection to his neighborhood."", u'Second movie starring Tom Hanks and directed by Steven Spielberg to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Motion Picture. The first was Saving Private Ryan (1998). Neither film won.', u'On the film, Kasia Walicka-Maimone was responsible for effectively conveying the time period of the story through the visual design of the clothing and accessories, but her biggest challenge on any film is to be a good listener. She explained: ""With each project we have to come up with new ways to understand what the story is telling us, to really grasp the color of the period and represent it in a subtle way that helps to portray the story and not overpower it.""', u""This film was Kasia Walicka-Maimone's first film with Steven Spielberg, and she was thrilled to find they spoke the same language, and shared a similar visual understanding of the story. Working closely with Adam Stockhausen, she immersed herself in the worlds in which the characters existed, hoping to find a glimpse into the truth about them. Fortunately, she had a great deal of freedom when creating the looks, which would define each character, because they weren't playing iconic people anyone would actually recognize."", u'Kasia Walicka-Maimone said: ""Our job was to deliver a sense of reality in those scenes. We discussed every single extra that needed to be dressed, because in order to represent a crowd effectively, you need to have a good mix of people. When having to present a crowd, which represents the humanity, and the streets of New York City, the collaboration starts with the extras casting director, because it\'s much easier to dress people when they have great faces.""', u""In The Terminal (2004), Tom Hanks portrayed an Eastern European character, from a region which is the reverse of the West. He played Viktor Navorski, a visitor to the U.S. from the fictional country of Krakozhia . In Bridge of Spies (2015), Hanks portrays James B. Donovan, an American lawyer from the U.S. In The Terminal (2004), though Viktor comes from Krakozhia, the language he speaks in the movie is Bulgarian. The written material shown, such as the Fodor's guide, and the magazine page with the jazz greats, is in bad Russian, while the label on the Planter's Peanuts can is neither in Bulgarian, nor in Russian. Viktor's driver's license is issued in Homel, Republic of Belarus, and has a woman's name on it - Gulnara Gulina - and is written in Cyrillic. It was a real license, provided by Gulnara Gulina, a woman from Belarus, who was working in the American film industry. Although the license, issued in 1995, was already invalid at the time of filming, the filmmakers just added Viktor Navorski's name in English and his photo."", u""Debut American Hollywood produced screenplay of screenwriter Matt Charman. Bridge of Spies (2015) was Charman's only second produced theatrical feature film screenplay after his first, Suite Fran\xe7aise (2014), a UK-French-Canadian-Belgian international co-production, which was a World War II romantic-drama. On both pictures, Charman acted as a co-screenwriter."", u'During filming, Steven Spielberg would run the dailies with Michael Kahn and his team, and give them his scene selects. And because Spielberg prefers to edit during principal photography, coming in before call time, during lunch, and after wrap, Kahn was able to assemble a cut of the film relatively quickly. Kahn said: ""It\'s great to be able to show him things while he\'s on the set, and to get his feedback while we\'re cutting.""', u'In this film, James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks) tries to introduce himself to some German officers. In Catch Me If You Can (2002), Carl Hanratty (also played by Tom Hanks) tries to introduce himself to some French officers.', u'Steven Spielberg\'s intuition of how to combine the camera and visual storytelling, with text, subtext and character, is prodigious according to Kristie Macosko Krieger. She said: ""Every director is a visual storyteller, but what sets Steven apart, is that he is literally taking in everything that\'s going on around him. He allows every other department to be at their best at all times, because he trusts them, so there is a sense of calmness on the set, because every person on the crew has the confidence to do what they do so well."" Kristie Macosko Krieger added of Janusz Kaminski: ""Watching Janusz work is phenomenal. He sees things that none of us can see, and he sees it in the light, and he sees it where the camera is, and it just seems so instinctual to him.""', u'For Janusz Kaminski, who hoped to visually convey the reality of the Cold War on-screen, he needed to come up with creative ways to revive the period, while not going overboard, as he knew that too much imagery would look fake. Steven Spielberg explained: ""We didn\'t have the budget to put blue screen and show miles and miles of digital period buildings out the window, so we had the windows frosted over. Then Janusz brought all the light, one source, a single source, from the glass, and it gave that first meeting between Donovan and Abel, a real coldness. As a warmth began to develop, or at least the opportunity for a relationship began to occur to us (and to them), you could interpret that cool light as being sort of a wall between them that would slowly come down over the course of their story.""', u'The contributions of Marc Platt and Kristie Macosko Krieger were quite substantial, according to Tom Hanks, who explained: ""Kristie knows everything in and out, back and forth. She knows the script better than I do, and she knows the subtext of every discussion she\'s ever had with Steven. Kristie realizes we\'ve got eighty-two billion working parts, and she can break down every one of those. No matter what is going on with Kristie at that exact moment, you can come up to her and have a fully-realized conversation about the topic at hand. She can tell you exactly what the status is of anything."" Hanks added: ""Marc knows the place that the movie holds in the Zeitgeist of films. He takes into account the history, the period and the casting choices and views it as a single-celled creature. A lot of times producers are beholden to the director, because without the director, their film doesn\'t get made. But I think Steven is beholden to Kristie and Marc, because without them, he doesn\'t have the freedom to think about the work purely in cinematic terms.""', u'Mark Rylance, who plays Rudolf Ivanovich Abel, said of Steven Spielberg: ""Steven is a very fatherly figure. I didn\'t realize how important and how much time he puts into his family until we worked together. I don\'t know how he finds the time with all the things he\'s doing, but he\'s really quite a family man and has maintained that, which is quite extraordinary for such a busy person.""', u'In addition to being an amazingly-proficient filmmaker, Steven Spielberg is genuinely concerned about his actors, and has a profound respect for their craft, constantly looking for ways to create a story on-screen in the easiest and most natural way possible. Tom Hanks said: ""Steven and I have a pretty good shorthand. I would come in with an enthusiastic idea for how to go about the scene and Steven would say, \'That\'s great, because what I want to do is play it all the way from back here, and if you\'re moving around like that, that\'s where the eye is going to go\'.""', u'Mark Rylance was amazed by the amount of preparation involved with each setup on this movie, comparing it with a Renaissance workshop. Rylance said: ""Steven comes in and you see him take in everything all around him. He is in total command of the big picture and everything going through the frame, the sets, the background actors, all the movements. Watching him, I imagined Leonardo Da Vinci at work. He was like a painter, but working with moving pictures.""', u'In the film, people judge Rudolf Ivanovich Abel for who they think he is and what they think he is doing, but James B. Donovan sees something different in him. And Francis Gary Powers is being judged as someone who let himself fall into enemy hands, yet Donovan sees him as a pilot who did his best, who didn\'t give any secrets away but who held the line. Kristie Macosko Krieger said: ""There is this wonderful moment at the end of the film, when people on the subway who had misjudged Donovan earlier, are looking at him anew because they realize what he\'s accomplished, and that they were wrong to judge this guy, and this situation. It\'s a fantastic moment for his character."" Navigating the unfamiliar waters of high-stakes international intrigue, James B. Donovan rose to the occasion with a modesty befitting the heroic acts that he performs, becoming an unsung civilian hero, and, in the process, the inspiration for an incredibly powerful story, and film.', u'Second movie collaboration of Tom Hanks with The Coen Brothers. The first had been the remake The Ladykillers (2004), which the Coen brothers both co-wrote and both co-directed, the film being based on the original The Ladykillers (1955). However, for Bridge of Spies (2015), the Coen Brothers did not direct, but performed screenwriting duties only. Bridge of Spies (2015) was first released in 2015, which was the sixtieth anniversary of the original The Ladykillers (1955).', u""During an interview about this movie with Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg said that when the cop in the movie told Tom Hanks' character that he was in the third wave at Omaha Beach on D-Day, Spielberg told Tom to say to the cop that he was in the first wave, a reference to his role in Saving Private Ryan (1998)."", u'One of the movies on the marquee is Eins, Zwei, Drei!, the German-dubbed version of One, Two, Three (1961), a James Cagney comedy, about an American businessman in Berlin, shortly before they built the wall.', u""Bridge of Spies (2015) marks Steven Spielberg's 50th directing credit."", u'Francis Gary Powers Jr.: Uncredited, the son of Francis Gary Powers as a CIA operative.', u'Steven Spielberg: [trademark recognition] In two separate scenes, multiple commuters on the train reading stories of the trial of Rudolf Abel look up from the story and recognize James Donovan , some looking over the top of their newspapers at him, some glancing up from their newspapers. Similarly, in ""Minority Report"", a commuter on the train reading a newspaper with the story of the hunt for John Anderton looks over the top of his newspaper and recognizes Anderton.', u'In the closing titles, it is explained that James B. Donovan was also influential in the Bay of Pigs negotiations, shortly after the events of the film. Donovan was asked to obtain freedom for detained Cubans and Americans imprisoned during the failed Bay of Pigs invasion of 1961. Over the course of several trips to the island, Donovan gained the confidence of Cuban leader Fidel Castro. He eventually secured the release of more than 1,100 survivors of the invasion, as well as another 8,500 political prisoners.', u'The film\'s closing epilogue and postscript states: ""Following his return to Russia, Rudolf Abel (Rudolf Ivanovich Abel) was reunited with his wife and daughter. He was never publicly acknowledged by the Soviet Union as a spy. Gary Powers (Francis Gary Powers) died in a helicopter crash in 1977, while working for KNBC news. He was posthumously awarded the CIA Director\'s Medal and U.S.A.F. P.O.W. Medal in 2000, and the Silver Star in 2012. In 1962, Frederic L. Pryor received his Ph.D. in Economics from Yale University. He is currently Professor Emeritus of Economics and Senior Research Scholar at Swarthmore College. Following the successful conclusion of the Powers-Abel exchange, James Donovan was asked by President Kennedy (John F. Kennedy) to undertake further negotiations on behalf of the U.S. In the summer of 1962, he was sent to Cuba, to discuss with Fidel Castro, the terms of release of 1,113 prisoners held after the Bay of Pigs invasion.

Steven Spielberg is said to have come up with an idea for a fourth film a month before the release of Jurassic Park III (2001) that was said to have taken the series into a completely new direction. Reports stated that the story, written by William Monahan, entailed Dr.\'s Ian Malcolm and Alan Grant returning to battle dinosaurs that have migrated to the South American mainland and was said to no longer be set in the jungle and include a massive underwater action sequence, with Richard Attenborough returning to play John Hammond and Keira Knightley in talks to play an older Lex Murphy. The plot also included a third island populated by dinosaurs and a ""conspiracy"" element. Paleontologist, and technical advisor for the series, Jack Horner stated that velociraptors would be integral to the plot and hinted that the film would imply that humans had evolved from dinosaurs instead of mammals. A later draft written by \'John Sayles\' dropped all returning characters other than Mr. Hammond, and followed a new character, a mercenary who trains genetically modified dinosaurs for dangerous rescue missions. This character appears to have been the inspiration for Owen Grady in this film. Another draft, still written by Sayles, contained dinosaur/human hybrids and even went as far to have concept designs created for the creatures and was rumored to be the beginning of a new trilogy for the series. Spielberg conceived an action sequence for the film that involved characters being chased on motorcycles by velociraptors. After repeated revisions to the script over the next few years, all previous concepts were then dropped and a new storyline was being worked on at the beginning of 2006. Laura Dern and Richard Attenborough confirmed they had been asked to return for the new film, but further development for the script slowed during the 2008 Writers Guild of America strike and eventually came to a halt when Michael Crichton passed away on November 4th of that year. The project remained dormant until the summer of 2011, when Spielberg began meeting with writer Mark Protosevich, but a strong story wasn\'t conceived until the end of that year and the script began developing in 2012. The new script based on Protosevich\'s work, written by Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver, would take elements from previous scripts, including genetic hybrids, trained dinosaurs, an action sequence with velociraptors and motorcycles, and combine them with the new concept of a fully functioning dinosaur theme park. Colin Trevorrow was hired to direct the film in 2013, and he continued to refine the script with co-producer Patrick Crowley. They originally had another dinosaur hybrid along side the Indominus Rex, called the ""Stegoceratops"", a combination of a stegosaurus and triceratops, but it was eventually removed before filming began to keep the focus on the I-Rex. A dispute ultimately broke out over who would get writing credit. Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver were credited along with Crowley and Trevorrow. The latter two disagreed with this, claiming that they had written an entirely new screenplay for the film, but the Writers Guild denied this and the credit still went to both writing teams, with the original story being credited to Jaffa and Silver.', u'Completed two days ahead of the 80-day filming schedule.', u'Chris Pratt and Eric Edelstein (Indominus Rex-pen attendant) worked together on Parks and Recreation (2009).', u'Jurassic World features many Samsung products including Samsung displays in the lab, Samsung Galaxy phones, Samsung Galaxy Tab tablets, the Samsung Galaxy Gear wearable during the dinosaur hunt and the Samsung Innovation Center building.

Malcolm dripped water on Ellie's hand and asked her to predict which direction it would roll off her hand. He demonstrated it twice and it rolled in two different directions. In this film, two drops of blood fall and roll off his arm in two different directions."", u'Three characters from the original film appear. Dr. Henry Wu, the T-Rex and Mr. DNA. Four if you count the statue of Hammond. Five if you count Dr. Ian Malcolm on the back cover of his book.', u""The opening shot of the film is that of the Indominus Rex hatching from an egg. This then cuts to a talon hitting the ground with a powerful sound, making the audience believe it is that of a dinosaur, before the camera zooms out and shows talon's owner to be a bird on the lawn of several important characters. Aside from being an interesting visual transition played for humor, it is also a fairly clever time lapse as birds have evolved from dinosaurs over millions of years, and time has clearly passed from the egg hatching to us seeing the characters as the dinosaur is almost fully grown when we see it next later that day."", u'During the film, while Gray and Zach are driving a jeep through a wooded area, Gray notices a swarm of attacking pteranodons in the rear view mirror. This is a subtle reference to Jurassic Park (1993), during which, as Muldoon, Ellie, and Malcolm are fleeing a chasing Tyrannosaurus, Muldoon looks in the side mirror to see the T-Rex closing in. The only detail missing from Jurassic World is the iconic message ""Objects in the mirror are closer than they appear.""', u'The visitor center from the first film appears.', u""In the scene where Claire is driving the van attempting to outrun the raptors, she briefly looks in the driver's side mirror only to see the raptors catching up to the van. A similar occurrence happened in the original Jurassic Park when Muldoon looks into the driver's side mirror to see the T-Rex gaining on the jeep as he, Dr. Sattler and Dr. Malcolm are attempting to outrun it."", u'Katie McGrath (Zara) performed all of her own stunts - being yanked into the air and being tossed around the water.', u'In the original script written by Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver, the film was to open in China with the bones of a new dinosaur, the Malasaurus, to be discovered. Director Colin Trevorrow decided that this dinosaur (later renamed the Indominus Rex), would instead be a hybrid, to further tie it in with concepts created in the previous movies.', u'Chris Pratt appears on screen for approximately 35 minutes.', u'Barry hides from Velociraptors in a hollowed out tree. Very similar to Muldoon hiding in a pipe from Velociraptors in the original book.', u'The T-Rex and Raptors, who are the primary enemies in ""Jurassic Park, "" are now Dino-Heroes in this movie.', u'BD Wong, who plays Dr. Henry Wu, states that the DNA of a cuttlefish has been incorporated into the Indominus Rex. In the TV series Gotham (2014), Hugo Strange, also portrayed by BD Wong, mixes cuttlefish DNA with the character of Fish Mooney during her reanimation.', u""This is the first time in the franchise that a 'long neck' dies on screen."", u'More people are killed by the Pterodactyls than the Indominus Rex.', u""In the scene where the soldiers go with the raptors to fight the Indominus Rex and the raptors turn on them you see one helmet cam of a man being dragged away while screaming. An almost identical scene can be seen in Aliens (1986) when a Marine's helmet cam shows him being dragged off while screaming."", u""One idea for a scene would have shown the Indominus Rex entering Jurassic World's Main Street, where it would encounter a robotic T-Rex statue, and immediately destroy it. Concept art was made for the scene, but it was ultimately not filmed, because the makers did not like the suggestion that it symbolized the triumph of a computer-generated dinosaur over an animatronic one, especially since several high-quality animatronics were used throughout filming."", u""The dinosaur skeleton that the T-Rex breaks through before fighting the Indominus Rex is a Spinosaur skeleton. This is a possible foreshadowing, that this isn't going to be like the fight between the T-Rex and the Spinosaur in Jurassic Park III."", u'Echo the Velociraptor is flung by the Indominus Rex in a very similar way to how Rexy flung the big one in Jurassic Park (1993).', u'When Charlie is killed by getting blown up with an RPG none of her blood splatters on Owen (who was in close proximity to her) it was most likely done to retain a PG-13 rating.', u'Charlie\'s death is exactly how one of the velociraptors cornering John Arnold is killed by Robert Muldoon in the Jurassic Park chapter ""Control IX"" by being blown to bits by a rocket launcher.', u'In the Jurassic World Special Edition Junior Novelization, Delta is the first Raptor of the Jurassic World Velociraptor Pack to die instead of Charlie. Furthermore, due to her death in the novelization, Echo is the one that kills Hoskins instead of Delta.', u'In the junior novelization Ellis (Eddie J. Fernandez) is swallowed whole rather than crunched and eaten in multiple bites by the Indominus Rex.', u'During the climax of the film, as Zach, Grey, and Owen are running to safety, they run through 2 stores and for a split second you can see an old Kenner 1997 bu\xf1l T-Rex toy.', u'First Jurassic Park film in which the main dinosaur dies. All the others lived.', u""When Claire explains the Indominus Rex's eating habits in the paddock's viewing room, she points to the worker when she says food."", u'The death of Zara (Katie McGrath) is synonymous that of the lawyer Genarro (Martin Ferrero) in the first Jurassic Park(1993) who is killed after failing to look after the two kids. Though in her case, the children are the ones who abandoned the adult rather than the other way around.', u""After entering the original visitor's center, the boys use a fossil (bone) and banner(cloth) to make a torch, similar to what Indiana Jones does in the catacombs in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade."", u'According the concept art for Jurassic World, the famous fight between Rexy and the Raptors was to occur in some kind of enclosure near a volcano in the rain instead of Main Street and there was one less Raptor involved. There was also supposed to be an animatronic Tyrannosaurus coming out of a waterfall which the Indominus bites, a reference to the scene in the Jurassic Park chapter ""Tyrannosaur"" and the Lost World Jurassic Park (1997) the scene where the Indominus bites the head off of the animatronic was cut when the script was being written, due to Steven Spielberg pointing out that the audience might have interpreted the scene as saying CGI is much better than animatronics. The location was later changed to Main Street and in concept art for the fight in the previously mentioned location, it was shown to be raining like the previous concept art and even had pterosaurs flying in the background. Lego Jurassic world adaptation of the fight seems to be partially based on the latter concept as Dimorphodons are present in Main Street when the battle occurs. In a storyboard for the fight, two Raptors were still alive and neither of them helped Rexy when she was overpowered by the Indominus. Instead the I. Rex continued to combat Rexy until she threw Rexy through a concrete wall close to the Jurassic World Lagoon where the Mosasaurus kills the hybrid just as she prepares to give the killing blow to Rexy with her sharp claws.', u'In David Lowerys storyboards for Jurassic World, the Indominus behaves differently after killing the Ankylosaurus, it is shown eating the Ankylosaur suggesting that the Indominus did not kill it out of sport or defense, but to possibly satisfy its hunger. another divergence from the film was that it joined the Raptor pack- all four of them- in the pursuit of Claire and the Mitchells in their vehicle.', u""Katashi Hamada's death is similar to how Carter trips and falls into a puddle before he is crushed and killed under the foot of the female tyrannosaur in the Lost World Jurassic Park (1997)."", u'Claire never drops the high heel shoes during the entire Isla Nublar incident, not even when the T-Rex is right behind her. Given the scenes revolve around much running Bryce Dallas Howard had to endure specific training learning how to move fast in the uncomfortable shoes while adding ""It\'s way better than running barefoot in a jungle"". In an interview with Cosmopolitan, Bryce Dallas Howard confirmed that her character will not be wearing high heel shoes in Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom (2018) she discovered this fact when Jurassic World director Colin Trevorrow texted her ""#NoHeels2018"".', u'The scene where Owen and Claire find the dying Brachiosaur (attacked by the Indominus-rex) is similar to the scene in Jurassic Park (1993) where they find a sick Triceratops.', u'The scene in which Omar Sy\'s character Barry ""stuffs"" himself into a log to escape an attacking velociraptor is a subtle reference the the original Jurassic Park Novel in which the character of Muldoon ""stuffs"" himself into a pipe in a similar fashion to escape attacking Velociraptors.', u'The ""Gas Jeep"" the boys find in the old park and use to escape is the same Jeep Hammond uses when he first brings Grant, Malcolm, and Sadler to Jurassic Park in the original movie', u""The film appears to include references to other science fiction films. When the paramilitary park rangers are being killed by the Indominous Rex we see their hearts flat-lining on a screen in the control centre, like when the Colonial Marines are killed in James Cameron's Aliens. In another scene, two of the characters jump off on ledge into water and crawl up a muddy bank to escape certain death, in a reference to John McTiernan's Predator.""]","[u'France::29 May 2015 (Paris)\n (premiere)', u'USA::9 June 2015 (Hollywood, California)\n (premiere)', u'Belgium::10 June 2015', u'China::10 June 2015', u'France::10 June 2015', u'Indonesia::10 June 2015', u'Kuwait::10 June 2015', u'Philippines::10 June 2015', u'Portugal::10 June 2015', u'Sweden::10 June 2015', u'Taiwan::10 June 2015', u'United Arab Emirates::11 June 2015', u'Argentina::11 June 2015', u'Austria::11 June 2015', u'Australia::11 June 2015', u'Aruba::11 June 2015', u'Brazil::11 June 2015', u'Chile::11 June 2015', u'Colombia::11 June 2015', u'Czech Republic::11 June 2015', u'Germany::11 June 2015', u'Denmark::11 June 2015', u'UK::11 June 2015', u'Greece::11 June 2015', u'Hong Kong::11 June 2015', u'Croatia::11 June 2015', u'Hungary::11 June 2015', u'Ireland::11 June 2015', u'Israel::11 June 2015', u'Italy::11 June 2015', u'South Korea::11 June 2015', u'Kazakhstan::11 June 2015', u'Republic of Macedonia::11 June 2015', u'Malaysia::11 June 2015', u'Netherlands::11 June 2015', u'New Zealand::11 June 2015', u'Peru::11 June 2015', u'Serbia::11 June 2015', u'Russia::11 June 2015', u'Singapore::11 June 2015', u'Slovenia::11 June 2015', u'Slovakia::11 June 2015', u'Thailand::11 June 2015', u'Ukraine::11 June 2015', u'Uruguay::11 June 2015', u'Bangladesh::12 June 2015', u'Bulgaria::12 June 2015', u'Bahamas::12 June 2015', u'Canada::12 June 2015', u'Ecuador::12 June 2015', u'Estonia::12 June 2015', u'Spain::12 June 2015', u'Finland::12 June 2015', u'India::12 June 2015', u'Iceland::12 June 2015', u'Lithuania::12 June 2015', u'Latvia::12 June 2015', u'Morocco::12 June 2015', u'Mexico::12 June 2015', u'Norway::12 June 2015', u'Pakistan::12 June 2015', u'Poland::12 June 2015', u'Romania::12 June 2015', u'Turkey::12 June 2015', u'USA::12 June 2015', u'Venezuela::12 June 2015', u'Vietnam::12 June 2015', u'South Africa::12 June 2015', u'Mongolia::16 June 2015', u'Tunisia::24 June 2015 (Tunis)', u'Japan::5 August 2015', u'Japan::22 April 2016 (Okinawa International Movie Festival)']",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Optimus Prime speaks in his native Cybertronian.', u'Originally, director Michael Bay was not going to direct a fourth Transformers movie, but he had an experience that changed his mind. After Transformers: Dark of the Moon (2011), Bay finally got to visit the Transformers ride at Universal Studios. Upon seeing fans waiting three blocks for the attraction, he realized he was not ready to give up the franchise just yet.', u'T.J. Miller reportedly did not get along well with director Michael Bay during the course of filming. Miller compared it to a ""very bipolar experience"" working with Bay, who once told Miller on set, ""Nothing that you\'ve said is funny, T.J.! Not one thing all day! We hired you to be funny! There\'s three hundred people here! None of them are laughing at you! Say something funny! I can still cut you out of the movie!""', u'During filming in Hong Kong, there were hundreds of onlookers watching from nearby buildings and parking garages. After filming a huge explosive scene, director Michael Bay used his megaphone to address people watching from on top of a building across the way, saying, ""You guys think you\'re going to wait up there and be in my movie? You\'re gonna get digitally erased!""', u'Seventy minutes of the entire movie are dedicated to action sequences.', u'Dwayne Johnson was offered the role of Cade Yeager, but he declined, due to scheduling conflicts with Hercules (2014).', u'Original designs for Grimlock, the dinobot shaped like a Tyrannosaur, gave him three claws on his forearms. This was because until 1989, intact forearms of the Tyrannosaurus Rex had not been found, and paleontologists thought Tyrannosaurs had three. The discovery proved that Tyrannosaurs in fact had two claws. Grimlock in this movie is featured with the anatomically-correct two claws.', u'Mark Wahlberg asked that his children, Ella Rae, Michael Robert, Brendan Joseph and Grace Margaret, receive roles in this film since they were Transformers fans.', u""Bumblebee's alternate mode in this film is a 1967 Chevrolet Camaro SS automobile for some of the film, then later a 2014 Chevrolet Camaro concept. Bumblebee also features a new burly design, sporting horns instead of antenna."", u'This film was part of a deal that director Michael Bay agreed with Paramount in exchange for financing Pain & Gain (2013).', u""Optimus Prime's alternate mode in this film is a cabover Peterbilt, and later a customized Western Star 4900 SB truck. The cabover truck is an homage to Optimus Prime's original alternate mode in The Transformers (1984), and the tanker truck pays homage to Prime's G2 mode (where he was a 1995 Western Star 4964EX tanker truck) and Transformers Prime (2010) mode (before he took on the alternate mode of a military truck)."", u'Director Michael Bay described Hound as ""a ballerina with guns."" This quote became part of Hound\'s dialogue.', u'Michael Bay describes Lockdown as the film\'s most interesting character: ""He travels the galaxy, he works for somebody else. He\'s here for one person, one alien, and then he\'s out of here; so he doesn\'t really want to take sides. The cause and balance of the galaxy is kind of messed up when different species play with different species, and that opens up a whole other gigantic world for Transformers.""', u'Part of the Yeagers\' getaway was shot at the Illnois Railway Museum. While there, Michael Bay took the cast and crew on a train ride, and Mark Wahlberg made a donation of forty thousand dollars to the Museum. Bay also purchased an old 1930\'s crane from the museum, which had ""Bay City"" embossed on it. He was going to have it restored and put it in his yard at his ranch in Montana.', u'Canonically, Autobots have blue (optics) eyes and Decepticons have red optics. In this movie, Lockdown and Stinger have green optics, and amongst the Dinobots, Scorn and Strafe have blue optics, Grimlock and Slug have red optics, and Slash has green optics.', u'A gigantic Hong Kong set was constructed in downtown Detroit. The set was so big, that the Detroit People Mover track ended up becoming part of the set, and shooting had to be adjusted to allow the track to move through the set.', u'Crosshairs (John DiMaggio) refers to humans as ""meatbags."" This is a tribute to Futurama (1999) where DiMaggio had voiced the robot Bender, who also refers to humans as ""meatbags.""', u'The was the first Transformers movie not to receive any Academy Award nominations. The previous installments all had nominations in the technical categories.', u""Drift's original alternate mode was a Nissan Silvia S15 sportscar, but this was revised to a Bugatti Veyron Grand Sport Vitesse sportscar and a helicopter (based on the Autobot Springer, a Triple-Changer Transformer who switches between a car and helicopter). He also bears black samurai armor, in an homage to the Transformers: Animated (2007) Autobot Yoketron, another Japanese-cultured Transformer, who possessed a similar armor."", u'This is the first Transformers live-action movie where Optimus Prime does not provide an opening prologue.', u'While filming in Hong Kong, Michael Bay was a victim of an extortion incident, where he nearly got assaulted by a man wielding an air-conditioner unit. On October 17, 2013, the Mak brothers barreled into the Quarry Bay set, with the younger Mak demanding a thirteen thousand dollar (one hundred thousand Hong Kong) payment from Bay, having accosted several other crew members. When he refused, the elder Mak swung the unit at Bay, which he managed to duck and wrestle away from the man. Several police officers were injured in the scuffle, with the brothers arrested. Less than a week later in Kowloon, four men extorted a production member who was setting up on the roof of a building demanding payment. One was captured, while three escaped in what was suspected to be members of a triad gang.', u'The first feature film to be partially shot with the IMAX 3-D digital camera. Originally, only select sequences of the film were to be shot using the camera. However, once he began using it on the set, Michael Bay enjoyed using the camera so much, he not only shot up to sixty percent of the film in the format, but he had the IMAX corporation build him a second camera.', u'The film introduced a less complex, smoother design for the robots, inspired by the designs from the IDW Transformer comics and Transformers Prime (2010). Director Michael Bay compared the redesign to Batman getting a new suit in each movie.', u'This is the longest installment in the franchise, at 2 hours 45 minutes.', u""This is the first film that doesn't have a Linkin Park soundtrack, with Imagine Dragons composing a song for the film. Linkin Park would instead compose a song for the tie-in video game Transformers: Rise of the Dark Spark (2014)."", u'Despite a slew of paleontological inaccuracies, this is the first major production to correctly feature the primitive ceratopsian Psittacosaurus with quills on its back and tail. Modern findings show that even more developed forms, like the famous Triceratops, might also have been covered in porcupine-like quills or feathers.', u'Michael Bay had resisted including the Dinobots in previous installments, as the writers had not come up with a convincing in-story reason for why giant robots, who (according to the first few installments) seek to maintain a low profile by disguising as everyday vehicles and appliances, would take the metallic form of giant reptiles who went extinct eons ago.', u'Roland Emmerich, Joe Johnston, Jon Turteltaub, Stephen Sommers, Louis Leterrier, and David Yates were considered to replace Michael Bay before he decided to return for the fourth film.', u'There are about 55 brands of product placements in the film.', u""Lockdown's original alternate mode in Transformers: Animated (2007) was a customized muscle car, but this was revised to a Lamborghini Aventador LP700-4."", u'The KSI building in the movie is actually the Blue Cross Blue Shield of Illinois building in Chicago. It is the headquarters of Health Care Service Corporation. Scenes were shot both on the exterior and interior of the building.', u'The Decepticon Stinger, who transforms into a 2013 Pagani Huayra automobile, is based on the Transformers: Animated (2007) Decepticon Wasp, who was an evil counterpart to Bumblebee.', u""Many of the actors have starred in live-action adaptations: This is John Goodman's fourth live-action adaptation of a cartoon series, after The Flintstones (1994), The Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle (2000), and Speed Racer (2008).This is Nicola Peltz's second live-action adaptation of a cartoon series, after The Last Airbender (2010).This is T.J.

This could be a reference to the online Cyber Missions episodes, which took place between Transformers (2007) and Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen (2009), and featured Ratchet and Lockdown fighting against each other (itself an homage to Transformers: Animated (2007))."", u'Counting the fire-breath from the Dinobots, there are 563 explosions in this film. This almost doubles the amount of explosions from the previous installment, Transformers: Dark of the Moon (2011), which had 283.', u""Hound's original alternate mode in The Transformers (1984) was a Mitsubishi J59 military utility vehicle, but this was revised to an Oshkosh Defense Medium Tactical Vehicle. His beefy design also pays homage to the Autobot Bulkhead from Transformers: Animated (2007) and Transformers Prime (2010), and his cigar-chewing military ways are a tribute to the Autobot war veteran Kup from The Transformers: The Movie (1986)."", u'In Boogie Nights (1997), Mark Wahlberg sang ""The Touch"", which came from the first ""Transformers"" cinematic feature The Transformers: The Movie (1986). Wahlberg joked with Michael Bay about singing and rapping for the movie\'s title track.', u""Crosshairs' original alternate mode in The Transformers (1984) was a Cybertronian off-road van-buggy kind of vehicle, but this was revised to the 2014 Chevrolet Corvette C7 Stingray."", u'According to Mark Weber, the Transformers Manager of Global Brand Development, the two-headed winged Dinobot was originally going to be called Swoop after the Dinobot from The Transformers (1984), on which he is based. However, he was re-named Strafe (after the Autobot Technobot) because his beast mode design was too much a departure from the original Swoop\'s classic Pteranodon appearance. The ""Transformers"" IDW comics paid tribute to this change by introducing Strafe as a character who starts out a normal vehicle-mode Transformer, but is mutated into a two-headed Dinobot.', u""Originally, three more Dinobots were to appear in the film, but were cut from the finished script; the apatosaurus Slog, the velociraptor Slash, and the stegosaurus Snarl. However, toys of them were still released as part of the film's toyline."", u""The robot bird logo on Yeager's mailbox and the basketball-shooting robot in his shop are from an actual competition robotics team from Austin, Texas.

Miller in mind.', u'The house used in the first scenes was the same house in Secondhand Lions (2003).', u'First live-action Transformers film not to feature Shia LaBeouf or any story line about the Witwicky family.', u'Originally, Lockdown was to carry the torn-out eyes of his victims as trophies tied to his hip.', u""Drift recites a haiku, to Hound's annoyance. The haiku is an homage to Transformers: Robots in Disguise (2000)'s Sky-Byte, a Predacon who enjoyed reciting haikus and other poetry (as the show was Japanese anim\xe9, this quirk was carried over into the English dub)."", u'Mark Wahlberg had to reshoot some scenes. This was problematic, since he had since dramatically lost weight for The Gambler (2014).', u'Concept Artist Vitaly Bulgarov created an evil female Transformer called Widowmaker as a potential helper for Lockdown. She was considered, but finally did not appear in the film, having been replaced by the Stingers.', u'During filming, the filming camp had a sign that stated ""E7"". In the seventh episode of The Transformers (1984), Grimlock, Slag, and Sludge, were built to help the Autobots.', u""Detroit has a monorail system that runs once every seven minutes and goes through this Hong Kong set. So they have had to work around that scheduled train and make sure they don't get any dirt or rocks on the tracks."", u'Shia LaBeouf did not appear in the film due to federal problems. When he went to jail, it was during the time that the movie was filming.', u'During filming, Michael Bay utilized the Shotover K1 platform for aerial shots in IMAX and 3-D-converted footage, for high-speed action sequences.', u'Paramount Pictures entered an agreement with teaming with the Chinese film companies China Movie Channel and Jiaflix Enterprises, to enable filming in China.', u'This is the first film to be released on Blu-ray encoded with a Dolby Atmos soundtrack.', u'Lockdown was originally envisioned with a vehicle mode closely resembling his appearance from the cartoon and comics, a modified muscle-car with a visible engine block, and his trademark black, green, and gray coloration. This was changed when the Lamborghini Aventador LP700-4 was chosen as his vehicle mode.', u'For all of the films, the filmmakers and screenwriters have visited Hasbro during development of the script to help build the story from the extensive mythology of the Transformers line.', u'The two evil human organizations, Cemetery Wind and KSI, are based on the terrorist group MECH from Transformers Prime (2010).

Cade walks across the street to the abandoned Uptown Theater, which is located in Chicago, Illinois.', u'In the scene where Shane and Bumblebee are in the design center with Stinger, the KSI executive that approaches and asks Shane what he touched, is actually Head of GM Global Design, Ed Welburn. His office, also the office of former GM executive Harley Earl, is used when Attinger meets with the Chief of Staff earlier in the movie.', u'Transformers: Age of Extinction (2014) sponsor General Motors provided a myriad of shooting locations for the film.

I can\'t account for how at any given moment I feel the need to explore one life as opposed to another. But I do know that I can only do this work if I feel almost as if there\'s no choice; that a subject coincides inexplicably with a very personal need and a very specific moment in time. In this case, as fascinated as I was by \'Abe,\' it was the fascination of a grateful spectator who longed to see a story told rather than that of a participant. That\'s how I feel now in spite of myself, and though I can\'t be sure this won\'t change, I couldn\'t dream of encouraging you to keep it open on a mere possibility.

He and his colleague Ken Sullivan discovered that although Mississippi voted to ratify the amendment in 1995, a clerical oversight caused that vote to remain officially unacknowledged, since the Mississippi Secretary of State had never sent the vote's result to the U.

After Sullivan also saw the movie, both men urged the office of the Mississippi Secretary of State to file that paperwork, which they did on January 30, 2013; on February 7, 2013, the director of the Federal Register confirmed its receipt along with the fact that Mississippi had finally ratified the 13th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States."", u'Daniel Day-Lewis is the first of two actors to win an acting Oscar for a movie directed by Steven Spielberg.

She recalled, ""I\'m ten years older than Daniel and twenty years older than Abraham Lincoln\'s wife was and Steven told me he didn\'t see me in the role. But I knew I was right for this part and begged him to let me audition for it. He was kind enough to do that and Daniel is such a sweetheart that he flew over from his home in Ireland to screen test with me. I\'ll love him forever for that.""', u""Lobbyist William N. Bilbo's (James Spader) appearance was created from scratch because not a single photo of him exists. His eccentric presence was taken from various sources."", u""Steven Spielberg has explained that during the movie's climactic scene in which the names of House of Representative members are being called to vote on the 13th Amendment, the names of many of the men who voted 'No' --for various reasons--were actually changed in the film so as not to embarrass the living descendants of these men whose reputations might have been stained by their negative vote-casting."", u'Once Daniel Day-Lewis decided on the voice that he would use to portray Lincoln, he sent an audiotape of it to Steven Spielberg in a box with a skull and crossbones on it, so no one but he would hear it first.', u""During the time when he was expected to play the title role, Liam Neeson did an extensive and timely amount of research on Abraham Lincoln. He read over twenty books and visited with the then-existing Lincoln Bicentennial Committee in Washington, D.C. The committee granted Neeson access to Lincoln's history such as personal letters. Neeson also visited Ford's Theater and viewed personal items such as Lincoln's wallet and the Bible used for his inauguration."", u""The ticking heard from Abraham Lincoln's pocket watch as he sits at his desk and plays with it is the actual ticking sound from the watch he carried in his pocket. An audio engineer went to the museum in Kentucky where the watch is kept to get sound bites from it."", u'The great-grandfather of Michael Stanton Kennedy was a newspaperman from the town where his character, Hiram Price, lived. When filming the scene where the 13th Amendment passes, Kennedy started to cry and couldn\'t explain why until later, when he told Steven Spielberg ""We\'re in this room recreating one of the most important moments in American history, and up there (in the balcony) with the press, sat my great-grandfather.""', u""According to Steven Spielberg, it was James Spader's idea to have his character seen as indulging in hand-carving a wooden duck, a preoccupation that Spader's personal research revealed to be one of the major hobbies of Civil War-era America."", u'The Ethan Allen story that Lincoln tells (including its vulgar punchline) is an actual story that Abraham Lincoln loved to tell, according to historian Doris Kearns Goodwin. It is unknown if the story is true or not.', u'Toward the end of the film, Thaddeus Stevens and his black housekeeper Lydia Hamilton Smith are portrayed as romantic partners. Although there is no officially documented evidence in real life that the two had anything more than an employer/employee relationship, the two were the object of much speculation and rumor during and after their many decades of cohabitation. Some unusual aspects of their living arrangements that contributed to the contemporary rumor that they were romantically involved included the facts that she moved from separate servants\' quarters behind the house into Stevens\'s main house; she frequently served as the hostess for events held at his house; and several of his family members referred to her in terms usually reserved for spouses in their correspondence. Stevens and Smith were also depicted as lovers in the 1915 silent film The Birth of a Nation (1915), although contrary to this film\'s reasons for inclusion of a romantic relationship between them, that movie\'s director, D.W. Griffith, used their relationship as racist propaganda and as supposed ""proof"" of the North\'s degeneracy.', u'Although some viewers were surprised by the usage of the word ""fuck"" in the movie, the Oxford English Dictionary dates the word back to (at least) the early 1500s, around 350 years before the American Civil War and Abraham Lincoln\'s presidency. In the movie, the word is used only twice, both times by the vulgar and rough Bilbo character as a way of demonstrating his uncouthness. Viewers who thought they also heard Lincoln using the term to describe ""Tammany Hall hucksters"" during a monologue actually misheard the then-common word ""pettifogging,"" which means arguing endlessly over small legal details.', u'While giving a fiery speech against Abraham Lincoln, Fernando Wood calls him ""King Abrahamus Africanus The First."" This was the title of an 1864 pamphlet, which was illustrated with a drawing of Lincoln wearing a crown and subtitled ""his secret life, as revealed under the mesmeric influence; mysteries of the White House."" This pamphlet was printed by the ""Copperheads,"" a group of Northern Pro-Confederate Democrats to which Wood belonged. It claimed that Lincoln had signed a contract with Satan to enable him to seize the US presidency for life and to ""subvert the liberties of the American people and debauch their civic aspirations; to impose upon them in every imaginable form of low cunning, and cheat them with words of double meaning and with false promises, until by these, and kindred means, that end is accomplished, and his dynasty firmly established.""', u'Steven Spielberg was already developing this film when he met with Doris Kearns Goodwin and confided in her that he wanted to make a film about Abraham Lincoln. She told him that she was in the process of writing her book Team of Rivals. Spielberg immediately decided to use it as the basis for the film, and asked to reserve the film rights before the book was finished.', u""Liam Neeson, who was attached to play Abraham Lincoln since the project began development, decided to drop out. According to Neeson, he felt he was too old to play the part after waiting so many years for the project to get the go-ahead. Incidentally, Daniel Day-Lewis is only five years Neeson's junior, though still closest in age to Lincoln, who was 55 and 56 years of age at the time portrayed in the film."", u""Abraham Lincoln and his wife Mary have one of their famous fights, in which he threatens to have her committed to a mad house. In the case of this film, the issue they fight over is their son Robert's enlistment in the army. It would be Robert Lincoln who ultimately did commit his mother to an insane asylum, tragically leading to their permanent estrangement."", u'Sally Field gained twenty-five pounds in order to more accurately portray Mrs. Lincoln.', u'Every major character in the film was a real person or at least a composite of real figures and the film strives to reflect the actual actions or thoughts of the historical figures.', u""Daniel Day-Lewis was named Best Actor of the Year at the Academy Awards for his performance as Abraham Lincoln in this film. His Oscar was presented to him by Meryl Streep who was named Best Lead Actress the year before for her performance as Margaret Thatcher in The Iron Lady. Streep was presented her Oscar by Colin Firth who had been named Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role for his performance as King George VI in The King's Speech one year prior. So in a span of three years, lead acting Oscars were awarded for portrayals of the King England, the British Prime Minister and the President of the United States."", u""According to Steven Spielberg during a chat at the University of Southern California's film school, the film came very close to premiering on HBO as opposed to premiering in theaters. Spielberg claimed that the only reason why the film reached theaters was because of his co-ownership in DreamWorks, which was one of the studios behind the film's release."", u'Steven Spielberg told a preview audience in Manhattan that screenwriter Tony Kushner spent about six years working on the movie. Originally, it was conceived of as a biography film exploring Abraham Lincoln\'s entire life story, but eventually was whittled down to the events surrounding the passage of the 13th Amendment abolishing slavery in the U.S. detailed in Doris Kearns Goodwin\'s book ""Team of Rivals"".', u'Bill Camp and Elizabeth Marvel, who play Mr. and Mrs. Jolly (the couple who comes to Abraham Lincoln to have him arbitrate a toll-booth dispute) are also married to each other in real life.', u'Daniel Day-Lewis became the first actor to receive an Oscar for working with Steven Spielberg, the first actor to win three Oscars for Best Actor in a Leading Role (presented to him by Meryl Streep,), the first actor to receive an Oscar for playing Lincoln, but the second to receive a nomination for playing him. Previously, Raymond Massey was nominated for the role in Abe Lincoln in Illinois (1940).', u'Neither of Abraham Lincoln\'s two vice presidents - Hannibal Hamlin and Andrew Johnson - are depicted in the film, although one of the unidentified cameos in the ""4 March 1865"" shot might be Johnson. However, the House Speaker, Schuyler Colfax, who presides over the 13th Amendment vote, later became vice president for the first term of Ulysses Simpson Grant, another character depicted in the film.', u'In several scenes in the Cabinet Room, a tube can be seen hanging between the ceiling and the table. This is a rubber hose carrying natural gas (methane) from the overhead gas lighting system to the table lamp. The hose occasionally moves slightly, seemingly on its own, due to fluctuations in the pressure of the natural gas system.', u'The two Presidents of the United States depicted, Abraham Lincoln and Ulysses S. Grant, are both played by London-born actors, who are the sons of Irishmen. Daniel Day-Lewis is the son of UK Poet Laureate Cecil Day-Lewis a.k.a. Nicholas Blake (born in County Laoise) and Jared Harris is the son of Richard Harris (born in Limerick).', u'Daniel Day-Lewis announced that if he won his third Academy Award for this film, he would retire from acting for five years. He did end up winning the award.', u'James Spader was personally instructed by Daniel Day-Lewis to be ""as nasty as possible"" to portray William N.

It is an authentic 19th century baton, ebony with an ivory handle, that Tony asked to be used to honor his dad, who died in March 2012."", u'Daniel Day-Lewis previously portrayed Bill ""The Butcher"" Cutting in Gangs of New York (2002), a character who opposed Abraham Lincoln\'s political plans.', u'There was no dramatic voice vote for the 13th Amendment; it was done by paper ballots.', u""This film marks Sally Field's first Academy Award nomination since 1985 for Places in the Heart (1984). This is also Field's very first nomination in the Best Actress in a Supporting Role category."", u'In this movie, Lincoln occasionally refers to his wife, Mary Todd Lincoln, as ""Molly."" This was a real-life term of endearment that Abraham Lincoln sometimes called her; it was a family nickname from her childhood.', u'During production, the part of Abraham Lincoln is listed on the call sheet as being played by Abraham Lincoln, not Daniel Day-Lewis.', u'In a scene wherein Robert Todd Lincoln debates with his father, who is getting ready for a White House event, Tad sits on the edge of the bed looking at glass photograph plates with a candle. One such photograph is of a slave named Gordon, who is also subject of a photograph entitled ""The Scourged Back"". These photos were taken by McPherson and Oliver out of New Orleans and were widely circulated by abolitionists as some of the earliest forms of propaganda in the fight to pass the 13th amendment to end slavery.', u'Hal Holbrook, who plays Francis Preston Blair, played Abraham Lincoln on television on multiple occasions.

This is a quote from William Shakespeare\'s play Hamlet (act II, scene ii). Although Lincoln was almost entirely self-educated, he was an avid reader of Shakespeare\'s plays; in 1860, the author and critic William Dean Howells wrote that the then-candidate for president was ""a diligent student of Shakespeare, to know whom is a liberal education."" Daniel Day-Lewis played Hamlet in a 1989 production at London\'s National Theatre.', u""This is one of two film properties wherein Lee Pace plays the antagonist of a character named Bilbo.

Ultimately, there is no mention nor sign of Johnson's character in the final version of the film, with the possible exception of the inauguration scene."", u""At one point in the movie, Abraham Lincoln scornfully references Tammany Hall.

Kennedy. The two men were elected to the Presidency 100 years apart (1860, 1960). Lincoln took it upon himself to end slavery, while Kennedy\'s time in office was marked by the Civil Rights Movement. Both men had southern Vice Presidents named Johnson. Lincoln was shot at the Ford\'s Theatre by an actor named John Wilkes Booth. Kennedy was riding in a Ford Lincoln Mercury when he was shot by Lee Harvey Oswald, who hid out in a movie theatre. This film adds three more similarities to the mix: it was produced by Kathleen Kennedy, features Tommy Lee Jones, who also appeared in JFK - avoin tapaus (1991), and both movies were scored by John Williams. Daniel Day-Lewis appeared in Gandhi (1982) with Martin Sheen, who played John F. Kennedy in Kennedy (1983). Sally Field played Sheen\'s wife in The Amazing Spider-Man (2012).

I wanted the world to feel really familiar, so that the characters would feel really relatable.

The filmmakers wanted to use a recognizable product containing caffeine that could make Max hyper enough to have worked throughout the night."", u'In an apparent nod to Rocky (1976), the world champion robot is named ""Zeus,"" while in Rocky (1976), the champion is named ""Apollo"" Creed.

He felt it was the perfect set for the first fight scene, called Crash Palace, in the film. No other location he visited in New Mexico, Los Angeles, or Georgia came close.', u'At the beginning of the first fight in the movie (the one in the ranch), Ricky says, ""...lay the smackdown,"" a typical catchphrase of ""The Rock"" Dwayne Johnson.

I don\'t even know what that means. All I can tell you is that it\'s a place, I think they made gravel, and what you\'ll notice is that I would say that 25 percent of the cranes and gantries and machinery that you see in this shot were there.

Nicknamed the \'rope-a-dope\', Ali utilized the strategy to tire fellow boxer George Foreman, a much stronger opponent than himself, and eventually gain victory. Ali famously angered Foreman with phrases such as ""Is that all you got, George?"" during the fight, mirrored in the film by Kenton\'s taunting hand gesture.', u'In a nod to the source story, the first fight with Noisy Boy was much like the fight in the book.

Vince Pace, the co-founder of PACE 3-D, who developed 2-D and 3-D cameras with James Cameron, reported in July 2010 that he was working on Transformers 3, and that it will be shot in on PACE 3-D cameras. However, for scenes that required higher image quality, or were in slow motion, traditional anamorphic 35mm film was used, and converted into 3-D in post-production.', u'The Autobots take on a new ability, labeled in the toyline as Stealth Force, which enables them to use weapons while staying in vehicle mode. This ability pays homage to the Omnibots, a faction of Autobots who were the only ones in the ""Transformers"" saga to possess this trait.', u""The Autobots have upgraded their alternate modes: Bumblebee has received an upgrade, and is now a 2011 Chevrolet Camaro. Ratchet's color scheme now includes white, and his green is more grass-green than his previous neon/yellow green. Sideswipe is now a Chevrolet Centennial Corvette convertible."", u'Megatron\'s alternate mode in this film is a Mack Titan tanker truck, his first Earth disguise. This was chosen to put him on parallel with Optimus Prime (the filmmakers described him as ""a demented version of Prime""). This mode also pays homage to the Transformers: Robots in Disguise (2000) Decepticon Scourge (also known in Japan as ""Black Convoy""), who is an evil clone of Optimus Prime. Octane was also a tanker in the animated series. He appeared in the 3rd and 4th seasons.', u'Mirage got re-named to Dino, not only because of Ferrari\'s insistence, but also because Mattel holds the rights for making Ferrari toys and models, and they didn\'t want ""their car"" to bear the name of a character owned by their rival toy-company Hasbro.', u'Wheeljack is modeled after Albert Einstein, and his personality was modeled after the Disney character Ludwig Von Drake.', u'Sentinel Prime is primarily based on his role in the ""Transformers"" comics (Optimus Prime\'s yellow-colored predecessor) and his lance and shield were taken from his Transformers: Animated (2007) incarnation, but his later form on Earth - a red Rosenbauer Panther fire truck - is an homage to Transformers: Robots in Disguise (2000)\'s Optimus Prime, whose alternate mode was a fire truck.', u'The scene where the Autobots are regrouping in a wrecked church, prominently features a statue of a half naked angel bending a sword above her head. The statue is from the ""Citizens\' War Memorial"" in Christchurch - a city devastated by earthquake during the making of this film. In reality, the statue is situated next to the city cathedral, which partially collapsed in 2011.', u'According to Frances McDormand, and as of May 2015, this is the only movie she has ever made, where she was paid her quote.', u""Laserbeak's alternate mode in The Transformers (1984) was a tape cassette, but that was considered old-fashioned.

This toy is an obscure allusion to Beast Wars II: Super Life-Form Transformers (1998), which featured a celestial rabbit named Moon, who lived on the moon.', u""This is Michael Bay's first threequel (third installment in a franchise)."", u'Before Laserbeak transforms from the photocopier, the worker who fiddles with it says that the machine is ""exceedingly Japanese."" Transformers originated in Japan.', u""Optimus Prime's trailer bears a resemblance to the original one from The Transformers (1984) with the decorative stripe running along its side."", u'Patrick Dempsey is a car enthusiast, like his character Dylan.', u'Over half of the film was converted to 3-D by Legend3D. In fact, forty minutes of non-visual effects, and 38 minutes of visual effects shots were converted. This includes much of the robot battling chaos during the final forty minutes of the movie, as well as close-ups and medium shots of actors on 35mm anamorphic film.', u'Bill Fagerbakke was considered to voice the Wrecker Topspin, but had to decline due to schedule conflicts. Thus Topspin is the only one of the Wreckers not to have any lines in the film.', u'The four-engined V-22 Osprey that Lennox and his team jump out of is not a real aircraft, which partially explains the full CGI animation of it. The Osprey has only two wings with an engine at either tip. It is the same aircraft seen at the beginning of the original Transformers movie.', u""The Wreckers take the alternate modes of NASCAR Chevrolet Impala automobiles, resembling those of Juan Pablo Montoya (#42 Target), Dale Earnhardt Jr. (#88 AMP Energy/National Guard) and Jimmie Johnson (#48 Lowe's/Kobalt)."", u'The Autobot who transforms into a Ferrari Italia 458, while unofficially known as Mirage, was named Dino after Alfredo ""Dino"" Ferrari (1932-56), the son of Ferrari founder Enzo Ferrari; this name change was stipulated by the Ferrari Company in exchange for the vehicle being in the film. Fans have also theorized that the term ""Dino"" is an intended allusion to the Dinobots, a popular faction of dinosaur-like Autobots.', u'The Visual Effects Experts noted that since Shockwave was a cyclops who didn\'t speak much, they had to make his eye emote in the form of ""silent-film actors"", so they gave it a lot of detailed components; these included a lens, a moving iris, and an oscillating light.', u'Throughout the Transformers saga, Laserbeak has possessed a media/music-related alternate mode. In The Transformers (1984) he was a tape cassette, in Transformers: Armada (2002) he was a video camera, in Transformers: Animated (2007) he was an electric guitar, and in this film, the last alternate mode he takes is a wall-mounted CD player.', u'The Wreckers, who have the alternate forms of NASCAR, bear distinct characteristics based on racing car fans. Together, they all wear shades; individually, Leadfoot bears a beard, Roadbuster has a beard, and Topspin has a mullet. Their paint schemes and numbers matched those of the Chevrolet Impalas driven in 2011 by Juan Pablo Montoya (#42), Jimmie Johnson (#48), and Dale Earnhardt, Jr. (#88).', u'This is the first movie that starts with Megatron being conscious. In Transformers (2007) Megatron was awakened, in Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen (2009) he was resurrected.', u'This is the first Transformers movie to show the Autobot spacecraft the Ark.', u""Brains's alternate mode is a laptop computer (Lenovo ThinkPad Edge). This is a tribute to the Autobot Blaster, who took the alternate mode of a laptop (Toshiba Satellite Qosmio); Brains also pays homage to Blaster's minion Rewind when he tells Director Mearing he knows all about the solar system (Rewind is known for spouting useless trivia)."", u'The ""dark of the moon"" is defined as a phase (approximately three days) when the light of the moon is obscured, and thus absent (i.e. a no-moon time), and precedes the new moon and the beginning of a new lunar cycle. Symbolically, it represents a time of inner stillness and contemplation, and preparedness for a new beginning.', u'In Washington, D.C., a Decepticon takes the alternate mode of a garbage truck. This is an ironic homage to the Autobot Wreck-Gar, who, in Transformers: Animated (2007), took the alternate mode of a garbage truck.', u'Megatron\'s first words are ""All hail Megatron!"" IDW Comics released a series in late 2008 titled ""All Hail Megatron"".', u""Corey Burton, who voiced Shockwave in The Transformers (1984) and Transformers: Animated (2007), was approached to reprise Shockwave for the film, but turned it down as he'd done that role too many times. He had earlier been approached to voice Jazz and Brawl for Transformers (2007)."", u""The Autobot Mirage's original alternate mode in The Transformers (1984) was a Formula-1 race car, but this was altered to a Ferrari Italia 458."", u'Paul Rubell, who edited several Michael Bay movies, could not participate in the editing, because of his work in Thor (2011). He recommended to Bay his friend, William Goldenberg to fill in his place.', u'Laserbeak\'s gift of speech was based on his original appearance in the ""Transformers"" comics. He has not spoken at all in any of the cartoons.', u""The Superfund armored truck was originally meant to turn into a Decepticon (it was part of the toyline and designated as Payload) and was marked with the Decepticon insignia, but due to budgetary issues, it's only seen as a vehicle in the film."", u'Shia LaBeouf reunites with his Even Stevens (2000) co-star, Tom Virtue (NASA technician), who played his father in the show.', u'Tony Todd, who voiced the title character of The Fallen in Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen (2009), was going to play a human character in this film, but his role got written out of the script.', u'As the Autobots head into Chicago, Brains gives the war cry ""Autobot victory!"" This refers to the Japanese series Transformers: Victory (1989).', u'From the voice actors in this film; Peter Cullen, Frank Welker, and Charlie Adler were in the original The Transformers (1984) series, while Keith Szarabajka worked in (as of 2011) the most recent feature Transformers: War for Cybertron (2010), and James Remar on its spin-off series Transformers Prime (2010).', u""The Autobot Wheeljack's alternate mode in The Transformers (1984) was a Lancia Stratos sportscar, but this was revised to a Mercedes-Benz E550 automobile.

According to Burton, Warner was his main source of inspiration when he started voicing Shockwave in the original animated series.', u""The original script ended with Optimus Prime accepting Megatron's truce offer and forming peace with the Decepticons; Megatron would have left for Cybertron while the Autobots remained on Earth, trying to build up a new Transformer civilization together on the two planets. The original ending was used in the novel and comic adaptations, but because those came out before the movie and thus revealed the twists, Michael Bay elected to change the ending to Optimus refusing the offer and executing Megatron."", u'The film contains tributes to Leonard Nimoy\'s Mr Spock from Star Trek (1966): Brains and Wheelie watch Star Trek: Amok Time (1967), noting ""It\'s the one where Spock goes nuts."" (foreshadowing Sentinel turning on the Autobots).Sam describes Gould\'s building as ""the Starship Enterprise"".When the Autobots are leaving, Bumblebee\'s farewell to Sam includes the words ""My friend"", sampled from Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan (1982) (""You are... my friend. I have been and always shall be yours."").Sentinel Prime says ""The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few"", a maxim of Spock.At the end of the film, Sentinel watches his homeworld get destroyed by his own technology, which Spock went through in Star Trek (2009).', u'Despite having a decent amount of screentime and dialogue, Megatron does not meet Optimus Prime until the last six minutes of the movie, and does not meet Sam at all, despite having faced off with him in the previous two films.', u'In the scene in which Sentinel Prime kills Ironhide, he shoots him which results in Ironhide turning to rust and disintegrating. This is identical to the way Galvatron kills Starscream in The Transformers: The Movie (1986).', u'Canonically, Autobots have blue eyes and Decepticons have red eyes. Sentinel Prime starts out with blue eyes, but gradually they take on a purple hue throughout the film, representing his change in allegiance. Just before the final sequence they once again return to pure blue.', u'At the end of the film, Bumblebee plays the Wedding March for Sam and Carly. In The Transformers (1984), Carly went on to marry Spike Witwicky.', u""Near the end of the battle, Megatron proposes a truce to Optimus Prime. This is similar to the special Transformers: The Return of Optimus Prime (1987), where Galvatron declared a truce with Prime. However, this film has Prime refuse the truce and kill Megatron for everything he'd done."", u'A Decepticon attack leaves Simmons in a wheelchair for most of the film. This is an homage to Chip Chase, a wheelchair-bound human from The Transformers (1984) who was an ally of the Autobots.', u'Megatron observes the Decepticon\'s arrival to Earth from the vandalized Lincoln Memorial. This is an homage to the The Transformers (1984) episode ""Atlantis Arise"", where Megatron used the Lincoln Memorial\'s chair as a throne. However, it also foreshadows his intentions of human enslavement. Abraham Lincoln was a great campaigner against slavery.', u""A Decepticon attachs itself to Sam and takes the form of a watch. This is a tribute to the Kronoformers, an obscure faction of Transformers who took the form of watches. The Watch-bot's design is particularly based on Scorpia, a Kronoformer designed like a scorpion."", u'Starscream meets his end by having an explosive in his eye, which blows his head off. This was based on the comic ""G.I. Joe vs. Transformers"", where the ninja Snake-Eyes cut out Starscream\'s eye and stuck an explosive into the cavity (there it didn\'t kill him though).', u'The concept of pillars on the Moon is based on science fiction novelist Arthur C. Clarke\'s short story ""The Sentinel"". The robot who designed and controls these pillars is named, aptly, Sentinel Prime.', u'Sentinel Prime and Megatron watch the destruction of Chicago from atop the Jewelers Building at 35 East Wacker Drive. Crime boss Al Capone also perched on the dome of this building, watching his city below as he wined and dined.', u'As the Decepticon mothership crashes, Brains screams to Wheelie ""We\'re gonna die!"" This was the catchphrase of the Maximal Rattrap, who appeared in Beast Wars: Transformers (1996). In fact it\'s not seen whether Wheelie and Brains survive the crash, as they aren\'t seen again, but the novelization claims they are last seen swimming away from the wreckage.', u""Soundwave's appearance in this film is based on his Transformers: Animated (2007) role: he transforms into an automobile, kept a group of humans under his control, and uses Laserbeak as his main minion."", u""At the Decepticon camp, a hand from the Tomb of the Primes, the hiding place of the Matrix of Leadership in the second film, can be seen. This hints at the Matrix of Leadership playing a key part in Megatron's plan."", u'When Megatron destroys the Lincoln statue in the Lincoln Memorial and sits down on it, you can clearly see the wheels on the back of his legs are clipping through the chair.', u'Michael Bay compared Megatron to Colonel Kurtz in Apocalypse Now (1979): ""He\'s hiding in the jungles of Africa, nursing his wounds and vainly hiding his pulverized visage while plotting - what else? - revenge!""', u'Originally Dino was to be the executed Autobot, but Ferrari objected to having one of its automobiles be killed off, and so he was replaced with Que.', u'The Decepticons\' master plan of bringing Cybertron to Earth with the assistance from human agents was based on the The Transformers (1984) two-parter ""Megatron\'s Master Plan"" and the three-parter ""The Ultimate Doom.""', u'At the end, Cybertron is destroyed by the space bridge causing a black hole within it. This is a tribute to the Unicron Trilogy saga (the collective term for the Japanese series Transformers: Armada (2002), Transformers: Energon (2004) and Transformers: Cybertron (2005)), where the planet Transformer Unicron was destroyed, forming a black hole.', u""In every Transformers live action installment, Optimus rips a Decepticon/bounty hunter.

I think I might have been more scared than J.J. I was trembling.""', u'Since Elle Fanning was 12 years old while filming her driving scene, it was illegal for her to actually drive, so there is another person driving the car with a mini-steering wheel in the backseat.', u'Originally, when the boys were sitting and waiting for Alice to pick them up, they were supposed to just talk. However, J.J. Abrams heard the boys singing together between takes later on, and re-shot the scene featuring them singing ""My Sharona.""', u'The train crash was largely improvised - there was no set storyboard for this key event in the film.', u'As teenagers, J.J. Abrams and his friend Matt Reeves (director of Cloverfield (2008) and Let Me In (2010)) were hired by Steven Spielberg to restore some of his Super 8 home movies.', u'Steven Spielberg (a producer of the production) was reportedly on set many times throughout the course of filming. Director J.J. Abrams and Spielberg have both gone on record stating that the filming of this production was some of the most fun they have ever had on set.', u'Approximately 5000 children were auditioned for the main parts.', u'It was very difficult for Joel Courtney to film the scene where he had to yell at Kyle Chandler (who played his father). Since Joel was naturally very quiet, J.J. Abrams had to coax him into yelling loud enough.', u'J.J. Abrams insisted that the train station scenes were actually shot at night outside, instead of in a studio.', u'J.J. Abrams originally had two separate ideas for his follow-up to Mission: Impossible III (2006). One was a coming-of-age story, the other was an alien on the loose idea. It was much later in development that he actually had the idea to combine the two.', u""In the summer of 2010, Joel Courtney visited his brother, an aspiring L.A. actor, attended one of his brother's acting classes, fell in love with acting, auditioned for a TV commercial in LA, was urged by an acting coach to answer a J.J. Abrams casting call, and after eleven call-backs landed the lead role of Joe Lamb."", u""The train crash was purposely made much more sensational than a train crash would actually be. The goal was to pay homage to the science-fiction movies of the '70s."", u'In the first draft of the script, the alien was never shown at all.', u""Since the kids were making a zombie movie, there are several references to director George A. Romero. For example, Romero Chemicals as the evil company, plus the poster for one of his movies in Joe's bedroom and reference on the radio."", u'The moving train was completely computer-generated, but in the shots of the kids moving among the wrecked train cars (shot at Agua Dulce 43 miles north of L.A.) the wrecked cars were actually there.', u'Bruce Greenwood provided the motion-capture performance of the alien. He is credited in the cast list as ""Cooper"", which was the creature\'s nickname on set.', u'J.J. Abrams mentions in the DVD commentary that every time you see the water tower in the movie, it is computer generated.', u'When the trailers began to be released, speculation started that this would be a prequel to Cloverfield (due to J.J. Abrams connection with Cloverfield) but J.J. denied the rumors and stated this was a different monster.', u""The film according to J.J. Abrams was homage to the producer of the film, Steven Spielberg, and his films of the 1970's ranging reverence from Spielberg's directorial films like Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977) & E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982) to Spielberg's produced films like The Goonies (1985)."", u""The first teaser for the film was shot by cinematographer Wally Pfister, Christopher Nolan's frequent collaborator, months before principal photography began.

In the popular episode of The Twilight Zone ""Walking Distance"" a dissatisfied man returns to his hometown and finds himself as a young boy, essentially reliving his childhood and a happier way of life. Director JJ Abrams (a Twilight Zone fan) revisits his childhood with this film, echoing the classic episode.', u'During post-production, Judd Apatow was shown some completed footage, which he praised as ""awesome"". J.J. Abrams subsequently placed Apatow in the ""special thanks"" section of the credits.', u'The video release has a supplement called ""Do You Believe in Magic?"" showing DOP Larry Fong doing magic tricks for cast and crew and Tom Cruise who apparently visited the set.', u'In the Snack Shack Diner scene where the kids are talking amongst themselves about the train wreck, Deputy Lamb can be seen through the window getting out of his patrol car at the auto dealership because, as it was originally written, the diner scene and the auto dealership scene took place simultaneously but during editing the dealership scene was moved to later.', u'Jeremy Renner declined the lead role in order to star in Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol (2011).', u'The Super 8mm footage seen in the movie had to be shot in 16mm, in order to give the VFX team enough resolution to work with. It was then ""degraded"" to resemble Super 8mm.', u""This is J.J. Abrams' first original feature film since it isn't a sequel or a reboot from another franchise."", u'The monster has 3 minutes of screen time.', u""The title 'Super 8' was a double entendre. As well as being the name of the film gauge, it was also referring to the fact that there were eight kids (Joe, Cary, Preston, Charles, Martin, Alice, Jen and Donny). Although later versions of the script were less particular about this, the title was nevertheless kept."", u'The green Air Force fatigues with the blue name tapes and blue insignia are correct for the 1970s era the movie portrays. The utility uniform would later change to the jungle then desert BDU.', u""J.J. Abrams named the film's fictional setting, Lillian, Ohio, after his grandmother. The map showing where runaway dogs were found shows it located on the north side of route 35 ten miles west of Dayton (twenty-two miles west of Wright-Patterson Air Force Base)."", u""While addressing the Academy of Achievement in 2006, Steven Spielberg said that his initiation to the magic of movies and the direct influence which actually got him to shoot his first film as a kid was Cecil B. DeMille's The Greatest Show on Earth (1952), especially its sequence of a train and car accident. In Super 8, which is a direct homage to the style of the family films from the 80s produced or directed by Spielberg, the train and car accident is the initiation moment for the coming adventure."", u'Deputy Jackson Lamb compares Joe\'s friend Cary to Carrie (1976). Ryan Lee would later appear in David Guetta\'s music video ""Titanium"" as a young boy with telekinetic powers.', u'DIRECTOR_TRADEMARK(J.J.

his blondish-brown comb-over wig, and wore false teeth to alter his jaw line. He also wore blue contact lenses and a lentil-filled fat suit to widen his girth, all topped off with square-frame eyeglasses, a fake mustache and sideburns. Since Tucci was uncomfortable playing a child molester, he wanted to alter his appearance for the role as much as possible.', u""The mother, Abigail's, major storyline from the book--her affair with the detective, and her reasons for leaving the family--was filmed, but cut out of the movie."", u""In Alice Sebold's original novel, a disturbing rape scene is recounted in great detail, an experience that Sebold herself had had as a young woman. Director Peter Jackson chose to omit this section of the story, feeling that the re-enactment of the ordeal would have not just overwhelmed the film, but been too traumatic a sequence for the young Saoirse Ronan to endure. Alice Sebold reportedly disagreed with this omission. Stanley Tucci, for his part, claimed that it was difficult enough for him to play scenes in which George was thinking about molesting Susie, and that he never would have agreed to perform an actual rape scene."", u'The main reason Ryan Gosling quit his role as Jack before filming started, was that during read-through sessions with Peter Jackson and the rest of the cast, he felt that, at 26, he was too young for the role. Jack was supposed to be in his late 30s. Despite repeated assurances from Jackson that he could portray Jack with proper make-up, Gosling insisted that, as a method actor, he would not be able to portray the character well enough, and was finally let go. Mark Wahlberg was brought in only one day before shooting started.', u'Saoirse Ronan landed the role of Susie Salmon based on an audition tape she sent in. They were so impressed by the tape, that no meetings or further auditions were necessary before offering her the lead role in the film.', u'Despite the fact that the violence in the novel had been toned down for the film, Stanley Tucci still had a hard time portraying Mr. Harvey.', u""Rose McIver, who plays Lindsey, the younger sister of Saoirse Ronan's character, Susie Salmon, is six years older than Ronan in real-life."", u'In the book, Susie and her love interest get intimate. This is not depicted in the film.', u'Alice Sebold, author of the novel, stated that she preferred an unknown actress for the role of Susie Salmon. After she was cast for this film, the relatively unknown Saoirse Ronan was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for Atonement (2007).', u'There is a poster advertising J.R.R. Tolkien\'s ""Lord of the Rings"" books at the bookstore. The director, Peter Jackson\'s, previous movies were the Lord of the Rings trilogy.', u'Along with Up in the Air (2009), this was one of the two films in which Paramount used its remaining marketing budget of 2009 to promote for consideration for an Academy Award. This forced Paramount to postpone the release of its other major studio film, Shutter Island (2010), until February 2010.', u""The film differs greatly from the novel. Much of the adult content in the novel, including a rape sequence and Abigail's affair with the detective, was removed in order to keep the film at a PG-13 rating. This effectively changed the target audience of the film to preteens and teenagers (which was apparent in box-office records), as opposed to the adult target audience of the book."", u""The end credits take up fifteen minutes of the film's running time."", u""Mark Wahlberg replaced Ryan Gosling just one day before shooting began. In preparation for the role, Gosling had gained twenty pounds, and grown out a beard. However, he vacated the role because he felt he was too young to play the part. Wahlberg, who had just completed shooting The Happening (2008), another production in Pennsylvania, became available just in time to accept Gosling's role."", u""Peter Jackson has said that he originally wanted to cast an American actress for the leading role, but was highly discouraged when the audition process began, and he couldn't find a single actress who behaved like a genuine child, rather than a child actor."", u'Helen Hunt was reportedly considered for the role of Abigail Salmon. Instead, Rachel Weisz accepted the role, and was the first actress cast in the film.', u'Peter Jackson tried to secure the rights to the book while working on The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (2002), but at that time, the rights were snapped up by a British studio (ITV) with an option to make a film. However, since it was never made, the rights lapsed. During production of King Kong (2005), co-Producer Tessa Ross found out that the rights had become available, and she and Jackson secured them.', u'Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz were the first actor and actress who were offered to appear in the film, which would have been their second collaboration together, after The Fountain (2006). However, while Weisz accepted her part, Jackman had to turn his down. Ryan Gosling was cast instead, although he would drop out as well, three days before the shooting started. Eventually, Mark Wahlberg took the part.', u""Despite being a last-minute replacement, Mark Wahlberg was always one of Peter Jackson's first choices for the leading role."", u'During the sequence when Jack repeatedly calls Fenerman with the names of possible suspects, one of the names is Frank Peretti (Jack actually spells the last name for Fenerman). Frank Peretti is a best-selling author of Christian supernatural thrillers.', u'The school that Susie attends is based on General Wayne Middle School in Malvern, Pennsylvania (now known as General Wayne Elementary School), which Alice Sebold attended in the 1970s.', u""In the school corridor scene, Clarissa mentions to Susie that the name Othello sounds like a mint.

Numerous test audiences wanted to see a more brutal ending for the character, so a last minute re-shoot was added, which shows him violently tumbling down the cliff side."", u""Many of the details and the sequence of events in the movie differ from Alice Sebold's novel. In the novel, George Harvey dismembers Susie's body and disposes of it by dropping the safe in the sinkhole, immediately after the murder (instead of much later, as in the movie). But George accidentally drops her elbow, which is found by the police, and forces the Salmon family to acknowledge her death earlier than in the movie."", u'In the first scene where Susie is seen shopping with her grandmother at the mall, George Harvey can be spotted turning right, just before the camera focuses on Ray. This can be read as George spying on Susie, as she mentions a couple of minutes after this take.', u'Throughout the movie, in the ""inbetween"" there are several items that appear that correlate to other victims of Harvey\'s. A sunhat, a rainbow ball, Holly, and a flower to name three. You see them first in the scenes, where Holly and Susie are spending time together, and again later in the movie, when the many victims are shown.', u'In the novel, Jack has a heart attack, which is why Mrs. Salmon comes home.

However, neither school is named in the film, as both schools felt that the Judy Witwicky scenes were damaging to their image.', u'The massive air strike in Operation Firestorm was caused by a 1,000-gallon gasoline bomb. Special Effects Supervisor John Frazier spent seven months setting it up, longer than it took to shoot the whole film. The bomb made the Guinness Book of World Records as the biggest bomb ever filmed with actors close by.', u""For the scene where Bumblebee blasts Sam's bedroom, an extension of the bedroom was built to be blown up, which would leave the original bedroom unscathed. But when the extension was blown up, part of the attic caught fire and the local fire department had to be called."", u'The film shot for four days in Jordan, at Petra, Wadi Rum, and Salt. The Jordanian royal family, who loved Transformers (2007), provided the Royal Jordanian Air Force for assistance.', u'Attending a preview of the film, Steven Spielberg is reported to have said upon seeing Devastator in Operation Firestorm, ""That is fucking awesome!"" Michael Bay was proud of the fact that he could make the normally well-mannered Spielberg swear.', u'According to Megan Fox, Michael Bay used multiple cameras in some scenes to film her from the front and behind: ""I\'m bent over airbrushing the bike, and I\'m wearing these really short shorts. I thought I was performing the scene with the camera on my face, but he had a multiple cameras going that were on a dolly, sliding in and out from behind me. My dialogue isn\'t even on camera!""', u""On July 27, 2008, Shia LaBeouf and Isabel Lucas were in a car crash. One of LaBeouf's hands required surgery. Production was only delayed two days; Michael Bay filmed second unit scenes, and LaBeouf recovered a few weeks earlier than expected. Bay wanted the hand injury to be written into the story, but Roberto Orci said re-writes were done to protect his hand for the remainder of the shoot."", u'Soundwave was originally meant to appear in the first film, but could not be properly re-worked. He was a helicopter, but that was re-written as Blackout. He then became a radio, then that was re-written as Frenzy.

The filmmakers were permitted to destroy twelve real trees, and in return they planted 6,000 new trees. Michael Bay says in the director's commentary, that being an animal lover, setting off explosives in a real forest was one of the more uncomfortable action scenes for him to direct."", u'Judy Witwicky runs out of the house with a waffle iron on her head.

Within three weeks, Fox gained ten pounds.', u""Bumblebee has only one spoken line in the film, which was seen in promotional footage; but for that reason, it had to be removed from the film (it's where he talks to Sam in his garage). Mark Ryan was disappointed that the line had to be cut from the film."", u'Michael Bay considered making Pain & Gain (2013) between Transformers (2007) and this film, but he ""didn\'t want someone else to take his baby"" and so stuck around to make four more Transformers films. He was finally able to make the film in 2013, between Transformers: Dark of the Moon (2011) and Transformers: Age of Extinction (2014).', u'Jetfire rants about how his father was a wheel, and did not transform at all. He is possibly alluding to the Autobot Scrounge, who appeared in the ""Transformers"" comics and whose alternate mode was a wheel.', u""The Twins were specially designed to reflect each other: Skids has an oversized left arm/eye and Mudflap has an oversized right arm/eye, and Skids's face is the top part of the Autobot face and Mudflap's face is the bottom part."", u""Michael Bay's pet dog Bonecrusher, adopted during the making of Transformers (2007), can be seen at Mikaela's house."", u'Near the end of filming, Shia LaBeouf hit a prop and injured his eye.

LaBeouf said it was the most insane experience he\'d been through, but he resumed filming two hours later.', u'White Sands Missile Range doubled for Qatar in Transformers (2007), and for Egypt in this one. This military installation is unique in that every weapon in the United States Army arsenal can be fired within its borders.', u'According to the ILM animators, Devastator is made of 52,632 pieces (more than ten times the number of individual parts in an ordinary car), 11,716,127 polygons, and 6,467 textures, and took up 32 gigabytes of computer space. If his components were laid end-to-end they would stretch 13.84 miles. All the gold ever mined in human history could build a little more than half of it.', u""A single IMAX shot (df250) would take almost three years to render on a top-of-the-line home PC running nonstop.

This is an homage to the 007 film The Spy Who Loved Me (1977), where James Bond rode a parachute bearing the British flag. Both this film, and that film, feature similar locations: a carrier ship, a submarine, and Egypt.', u'The Fallen was originally considered to have an alternate mode: the Aurora, a mythical espionage aircraft. This was scrapped, in favor of him having no alternate mode, to represent him as primal and ancient.', u'During the beginning NEST scene when you see the British flag patch on the shoulder of Captain Graham (Matthew Marsden), the patch right under it says ""If I tell you, I have to kill you.""', u""Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman originally passed on this film, due to scheduling conflicts with other films, but the studios returned to them after looking through the other writers' scripts and finding them unsatisfactory. However, they had only three weeks to write the script, due to the 2007 Writer's Guild of America strike. Michael Bay and Shia LaBeouf expressed disappointment with the film, due to the script's rushed treatment."", u'Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman approached Leonard Nimoy to voice the Fallen while the three of them worked on Star Trek (2009). Nimoy voiced Galvatron, Megatron\'s successor, in The Transformers: The Movie (1986). Michael Bay was nervous about approaching a relative (Nimoy is married to Bay\'s cousin), particularly a famous one: ""I just feel kind of bad about asking him. \'I can\'t pay you that much, but would you do this voice?\'"" Nimoy later said that he was enthusiastic about voicing a Transformer and would have loved to be the Fallen; he would later get the role of Sentinel Prime in Transformers: Dark of the Moon (2011).', u'When Sam enters the dormitory, the website that is mentioned by his room mate, therealeffingdeal.com, actually takes you to the official site of Transformers 4.', u'This was the highest-grossing film in Malaysia, grossing about 7.85 million dollars.', u'The word ""transformer"" is heard only once in the film, used by Simmons in his bunker (""The Transformers, they\'ve been here a long, long time.""). Its derivatives are used by the Fallen and Jetfire.', u'The animators designed Devastator\'s first appearance as ""a scary transformation, where things are slamming together and getting pulled around. All seven vehicles shove themselves together and click into place as he grows into this giant, scary dude.""', u'Egyptian government official and archaeologist Zahi Hawass, who loved Transformers (2007), got a personal promise from Michael Bay not to destroy buildings during filming before he granted permission to shoot in Egypt.', u""On The Transformers (1984), Soundwave's distinctive voice was created by Frank Welker using his deep ominous Doctor Claw voice from Inspector Gadget (1983), and then filtering the voice through a vocoder. In this film, Soundwave's voice was not treated with a vocoder."", u'During Operation Firestorm, the Twins grab onto a pipe. For a moment, a newspaper blows onto the pipe, on which a headline (""...STERIOUS ROBOT SIGHTED"") and an image of a robot can be seen. The image is of Shockwave, who is seen in his The Transformers (1984) appearance. It also hints at his arrival in Transformers: Dark of the Moon (2011).', u""According to writers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman, the appearance of the Fallen was meant to lead into the arrival of the Fallen's master, the planet-devouring Transformer Unicron, in Transformers: Dark of the Moon (2011). When they turned down the third film, however, that plotline was scrapped."", u""Arcee was originally meant to appear in the first film, but was replaced with Ironhide, because the writers thought robot genders would be difficult to explain. Afterward, they decided to include Arcee to please fans, and ignore the gender issue. Arcee's alternate mode was felt to be too small for her to be an effective warrior, so she got two partners, Chromia and Elita-1."", u""While rendering Devastator, one ILM animator's computer reportedly overheated, and its internal circuitry melted."", u""In Sam's dorm room, there is a theatrical film poster of Bad Boys II (2003), another film directed by Michael Bay."", u""Bumblebee continues to use his radio to communicate, even though at the end of Transformers (2007) he was able to speak briefly. The writers liked Bumblebee's radio ability and wanted to use it again, so the movie comic ''Transformers: Alliance' (#3) explains that Bumblebee's voice processor was damaged again in a battle with Starscream."", u'The film shot in Egypt for three days, primarily at the Giza pyramid complex and Luxor. According to Lorenzo di Bonaventura, the shoot was highly secretive: ""A crew of 150 Americans, and several dozen local Egyptians, ensured a remarkably smooth shoot.""', u""According to Michael Bay, the scene with Sam's baby booties was inspired by a personal experience in 2006, where his own mother found his baby shoes and gave them back to him."", u""During production, Michael Bay attempted to create a misinformation campaign to increase debate over what Transformers would appear in the film, and try to throw fans off of the story of the film. According to Roberto Orci, it didn't work."", u'Optimus Prime was originally going to appear with his iconic truck trailer, and would have combined with it as well. However, changes to the script caused this concept to be scrapped. He finally got his trailer in Transformers: Dark of the Moon (2011).', u'In The Transformers (1984), there were two sportscar brothers named Sideswipe and Sunstreaker. Sideswipe had already been selected as a single character. When Michael Bay saw the Chevrolet Trax and Beat, he thought they looked good together and had the potential to be as cool as any big truck. The Twins were altered to miniature automobiles, and were renamed Skids (after the Autobot from the 1980s ""Transformer"" comics) and Mudflap (after the Transformers: Cybertron (2005) Autobot).', u""The Transformers were created with a mix of computer graphics imagery and props, including a life-scale model of Bumblebee (the same used from the first film), a life-scale model of Optimus Prime, a life-scale puppet of robot-mode Wheelie, a model of the Matrix of Leadership, Jetfire's landing gear/cane, a puppet of Ravage, a puppet of Scalpel, Megatron's claw, and the Fallen's face. CGI was used extensively, so scenes could be filmed easily."", u'Four-foot actor Beetlejuice was offered the role of the little Egyptian guard and met with Michael Bay, but the meeting did not go well, and Beetlejuice angrily turned the role down. Instead Deep Roy got the role.', u'Shooting started the day after Transformers (2007) won the MTV Movie Award for Best Movie.', u'The Dinobots, a faction of Autobots who took the forms of dinosaurs, received strong support from fans to appear in the film. Alex Kurtzman dismissed them as an unlikely concept for an alien robot film, but decided to reserve them for a sequel, because of their popularity among fans. The Dinobots would appear in Transformers: Age of Extinction (2014).', u'From the Autobot Sisters, the pink motorcycle is Arcee, the blue bike is Chromia and the purple motorbike is as Flareup; their toys are marketed and sold as such. However, Roberto Orci maintains that the Sisters are all Arcee.', u'Over 1.25 million feet of film were shot.', u""The ILM animators studied each others' eyes to get an impression of how to express emotion in the robots' optics (eyes). In the previous film, they'd relied on the light from the optics, in this film, they relied on the optics' movement to express emotion."", u'NEST is the alliance between the humans and the Autobots. It has different meanings: ""Networked Elements: Supporters and Transformers,"" ""Non-biological Extraterrestrial Species Team,"" and ""Non-biological Extraterrestrial Species Treaty."" It could also refer to Earth being a nest (refuge) for the Autobots. There is also a real-life NEST agency: The Nuclear Emergency Support Team.', u'Michael Bay brought his mother with him to Petra for the shoot, to show her around.', u""During filming, Mark Ryan acted as a stand-in for the Transformers on-set, to give the actors a physical presence to which to react, and against whom to act. He also ad-libbed characters during the film's post-production. He was taken on-board to voice Jetfire."", u'During the air drop scene into the desert village, a goat can be seen leaping off a roof and onto the ground.', u'Teresa Palmer was originally cast as Alice, but Michael Bay claims on his blog that she was never considered.', u'Rachael Taylor, who starred as the Australian Maggie Madsen in Transformers (2007), turned down a chance to reprise her role.', u'The photos of Seekers are a Ford Model T, a B-24 ""Liberator"" bomber, an F-104 ""Starfighter"" jet, an ""Albatross"" D III biplane (Ransack, who appears only in the movie novelization), and an SR-71 ""Blackbird"" jet (Jetfire).', u'The Transformers slogan ""Robots in disguise"" is used by Agent Simmons when he discusses Project Black Knife.', u""According to Sound Editor Erik Aadahl, the Audio Effects Experts used inventive techniques in this film: The Microcons Ravage expels from his body make a quivering zinging sound, the amplified sound of a couple of magnets tossed in the air and clacking together.The Insecticon Sam holds in his hand makes a chirping noise, made from the vibrating hum of Aadahl's own shaver.The creaking of Jetfire's joints were formed from opening a stove door.The stomping noises Devastator makes was created from slamming a dryer door."", u""Ravage's alternate mode in The Transformers (1984) was a tape cassette, but that was considered old-fashioned. He retains his robotic panther form throughout the film."", u""Bumblebee's alternate mode in this film is a 2010 Concept Chevrolet Camaro. This was a redesign of his previous 2009 Chevrolet Camaro mode, carried out to emphasize Bumblebee becoming stronger and sturdier after his injury in the first film. The Chevrolet logo on Bumblebee's grill in the first film is yellow, but in this film it is black with a red outline."", u'Steve Jablonsky brought in his mentor Hans Zimmer and the rock band Linkin Park to assist in composing the musical score. The trio collaborated on making a musical score set to the band\'s song ""New Divide.""', u'General Morshower is named after the actor who plays him, Glenn Morshower.', u'Originally, the Twins and the Autobot Sisters were planned to respectively combine into bigger stronger robots. However, this was too expensive, and would have been too much in the film anyway (however, the Twins are seen at the beginning of the film combined in an ice cream truck).', u'Mark Ryan and Tom Kenny , who voice the Autobot Bumblebee and Skids, also voice Decepticons Wheelie and Jetfire (though both change sides).', u'The Decepticon who steals the AllSpark at the NEST base, is named Reedman, because he was made out of hundreds of miniature bug-like robots (described as Microcons). The Visual Effects Experts described him as ""a bunch of razor blades really, but cooler looking than that! He\'s able to orient himself in a particular axis to make himself invisible from that axis.""', u'In the Transformers saga, a space bridge is a portal that connects certain points in space, to allow for easy transportation. In this film, it is an ability (used by Jetfire and the Fallen) to teleport to certain places.', u'Anthony Anderson, who played Glen Whitman in Transformers (2007), was considered to voice the Autobot Jolt.', u'Wheelie calls Mikaela ""warrior goddess."" ""Mikaela"" is the feminine form of ""Mikael"", a Hebrew name roughly meaning ""god-like.""', u'According to Roberto Orci, Jonah Hill was offered the part of Leo Spitz, and even received a copy of the script, but negotiations fell through.', u'According to Roberto Orci, the film\'s central theme is ""being away from home and adapting to a new world."" Sam must leave home for college, and the Autobots make Earth their new home.', u""The Fallen's face resembles the Decepticon insignia, with an Egyptian crown attached. He also has red magma lines running across his body, a reference to his original aflame appearance in the comics.

John C. Stennis, which was conducting exercises off the southern California coast. Some of the extras were Navy sailors. Tyrese Gibson gave an impromptu concert in the hangar bay after filming completed.', u'The Forest Battle and Operation Firestorm were shot with IMAX cameras. Because of the increased resolution, it took ILM animators 72 hours to render one frame of those scenes.', u'The Visual Effects Experts believe Soundwave is their most interesting robot: ""While he doesn\'t have a transformation, he is a combination of mechanical robotic pieces and these organic space-age tentacles. He will lock onto a satellite and as his tentacles search out, they lay out these very geometrically shaped and patterned tentacles akin to the structure you see on a circuit board. The bigger ones look like metallic rubber; the little ones look more like glass. They creep over the satellite almost like an L-system.

The explosions would be in close proximity, and very dangerous to the actors in the scene, so before the scene was shot, Michael Bay told the actors to run and keep running no matter what happens, or else they could seriously be injured or, even worse, killed. As a result, the look of panic on the actors' faces as they flee from Scorponok in this scene, is one hundred percent genuine."", u""To keep the film realistic and under budget, the U.S. Department of Defense provided their support towards the film's production, the largest project they have assisted since Black Hawk Down (2001). The Military provided their vehicles as the alternate modes of the Decepticons Starscream and Bonecrusher. They also allowed their F-22 and CV-22 aircraft to be filmed, the first time these planes have been seen in a feature film since Hulk (2003). Soldiers served as extras, and authentic uniforms were provided for the actors.

This was because test designs showed a cabover could only disguise a twenty-foot robot, and so the larger Peterbilt truck was chosen to make Prime taller (at 32 feet tall). The truck was also colored blue with red flames (like Rodimus Prime, Optimus's successor), to give Prime a distinct look."", u""Bumblebee's original alternate mode in The Transformers (1984) was a Volkswagen Beetle, but this was revised to a 1976/2009 Chevrolet Camaro. This was because Michael Bay wanted to avoid comparisons with Herbie the Love Bug, and felt that the Camaro held a more tough-but-friendly quality than the Beetle. As a tribute to the series, a yellow Volkswagen Beetle appears next to Bumblebee at the auto dealership (and as a joke he damages it)."", u'In the film, Megatron does not choose an alternate mode, choosing, out of arrogance, not to disguise himself on Earth. He instead maintains his alien protoform/jet mode. His original alternate mode in The Transformers (1984) was a Walther P38 pistol, but the writers felt it was like ""having Darth Vader transform into his own lightsaber and someone else swinging him around,"" so he was given a more realistic alien design, and made more hideous, to make him more menacing.', u'Optimus Prime speaks his trademark motto (""Freedom is the right of all sentient beings."") for the first time ever; it was not heard in The Transformers (1984), but was mentioned in the packaging for his original action figure back in the 1980s.', u""As the Decepticons' pilot holograms flicker, Optimus Prime's face can be seen for an instant."", u'Shia LaBeouf\'s first scene filmed was where Sam is attacked by guard dogs.

To please the fans, though, Megatron\'s classic berating of Starscream (""You fail me yet again, Starscream..."") was put in the film.', u'In her role as Mikaela Banes, Megan Fox gained ten pounds of muscle to be more compatible for the action scenes.', u'To make the cars appear sentient, stunt drivers wore black balaclavas, and concealed themselves from view; and wherever possible, the cars were also given tinted windows, and had their interiors darkened.', u'According to the ILM animators, each and every transformation in the film is unique (even if carried out by the same robot), with thousands of components moving around in significantly different orders/sequences and via different routes around the body. This is because the robots transform in a fluid, instinctive manner depending on their circumstances (speed/terrain/intent of action); however, the animators also admit that each transformation was mainly animated to look interesting and believable.', u""Since there were no running 2009 Chevrolet Camaro automobiles during production, Saleen Inc., working with the Pontiac GTO and using Camaro designs from General Motors, was able to build a running Camaro in thirty days, to serve as Bumblebee's alternate mode. Saleen also provided one of their S281 automobiles (a modified Ford Mustang) to serve as Barricade's alternate mode."", u'The Transformers possessed such a rich level of detail and complexity, it took the ILM animators 38 hours to fill them in a single frame of the film.', u'To prepare for their roles, Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson spent three days in boot camp, and Gibson also spent time with combat controller Ray Bollinger to make his dialogue sound natural.', u'For the scene where Megatron corners Sam at the top of a tall building and Sam clings on to a statue out of sheer panic and fright, Shia LaBeouf was actually on top of the building wearing a safety harness, but with no safety net beneath him, and so his terror was real.', u'Shia LaBeouf was so amazed with the ""Project Iceman"" set that he would secretly visit the set on weekends, sometimes bringing his friends along.', u""Michael Bay originally wanted an Apple iPod for Simmon's demonstration in the All Spark chamber, but Apple CEO Steve Jobs objected to the use of one of his products, and a Nokia cellphone was used instead."", u'The film\'s tagline ""Their war.

Michael Bay also felt his voice was too light for Megatron's new beastly look, and so Hugo Weaving took the role of Megatron.

Reece had to reschedule his wedding and honeymoon to film his scenes.', u'Steve Jablonsky was assisted by his mentor Hans Zimmer in composing the musical score.', u'As part of the promotion campaign for the film, a special Sector 7 site was launched that featured videos showing ""evidence"" of Transformers having already arrived on Earth: a video featuring Grimlock destroying a construction site; Reflector transforming at a birthday party; Kickback and Laserbeak being accidentally videotaped; and a security video showing Bumblebee (in his old Volkswagen Beetle mode) transforming in a parking garage.', u'Michael Bay originally turned down directing the film, considering it ""a stupid toy movie."" However, he wanted to work with Steven Spielberg, and wanted to make the first family film of his career, and being a car buff, the idea of sentient cars interested him. He later admitted that not being a Transformers fan, proved to be a blessing, as it enabled him to introduce the saga to other non-fans.', u'To keep up the film\'s frenetic mood, most of the action sequences were shot practically, with the actors performing their stunts live on camera. All computer graphics imagery was restricted only to the robots and certain essential scenes. Due to the intensity of the action (a majority of car crashes and explosions), the camera was kept in a box of bulletproof glass. Shia LaBeouf later quipped, ""The camera\'s protected, but the actors are expendable!""', u'Michael Bay cut his fee by thirty percent, to save expenses on shooting, and to keep the film in the United States, territory he was familiar with.', u""Sam's eBay name LadiesMan217 refers to Michael Bay's birthday: February 17th.

He was eventually taken on board to voice Bumblebee."", u'Don Murphy originally wanted the film to feature seven Autobots (Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, Ironhide, Jazz, Ratchet, Prowl, and Wheeljack) against eight Decepticons (Megatron, Starscream, Soundwave, Ravage, Laserbeak, Rumble, Skywarp, and Shockwave). Only seven of those Transformers (five Autobots and two Decepticons) made it into the film, but Soundwave and Ravage made it into the second film, and Laserbeak and Wheeljack (renamed Que) made it into the third film.', u'As the script went through several different versions over the years, every draft of the script always included the same four characters: Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, Megatron, and Starscream.', u'The character of Mikaela Banes is named after Michael Bay.', u'Bumblebee was designed to visually resemble a bumblebee: his coloring is yellow/black, the protrusions on his helmet resemble antennae, and the car doors fold up behind him like wings.', u""The female Autobot Arcee was going to appear in the film, but the writers couldn't properly explain the concept of robot gender in the film, so she was removed and replaced with Ironhide.

His back side reads ""To punish and enslave,"" a twisted version of the classic police slogan ""To protect and serve.""', u'The sequence where Bonecrusher smashes a bus in half was an actual stunt filmed live. The bus was constructed with a split-line and had cables built-in (which held the bus together until they were cut off), as well as explosives and cannons (which were used to blow the bus apart).', u'During the Scorponok Desert Attack, Captain Lennox calls reinforcements through a telephone. This was inspired by a real-life anecdote a soldier told Michael Bay during filming: during the Grenada invasion, a unit lost its radio in an attack, but found a nearby telephone line, so one of the soldiers in the unit helped out by giving his credit card to get through to the Pentagon. A scene depicting this, featuring Mario Van Peebles, was in Heartbreak Ridge (1986).', u""According to one of the CGI artists at the Industrial Light & Magic studio, if you took all the polygons (CGI blocks) from all the Transformer models they created and strung them end to end, they'd reach to the moon and back and you'd still have enough left over to build the Roman Colosseum in Italy twice."", u'Frenzy\'s Cybertronian dialogue is mostly the word ""Tutankhamun"" repeated over and over rapidly.', u'In the The Transformers (1984) series, the Autobots had blue optics (eyes) and the Decepticons had red optics. The animators created a new eye design resembling a camera shutter in order to make the robots more engaging; however, the color scheme remains the same.

In that feature though, Prime was the one who fell, while in this film it is Megatron.', u'According to Michael Bay, the Battle of Mission City did not expose the Transformers to the world: ""Everybody has gone ahead. It\'s realistic. Two weeks after the 2004 tsunami, nobody talked about it anymore. It\'s very weird. We decided to do the same with the Transformers. The government talks about a military thing, says all is false, that it\'s a joke; and people don\'t know what they really saw.""', u'Sentinel Prime was going to appear in the film. During the Battle of Mission City, time would stop and he would briefly appear to Sam, giving him a clue as to how to defeat Megatron. In the final film, Optimus Prime provides this clue, but the concept was recycled into the Dynasty of Primes in Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen (2009), and Sentinel Prime himself would appear in Transformers: Dark of the Moon (2011).', u'An F-22 in the Battle of Mission City blitzes Megatron. Fans suggested that the attacking F-22 was Starscream in disguise, which fits in with his classic double-crossing nature and comes up in Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen (2009). Writer Roberto Orci felt it was up to fans to decide if it was really Starscream, having not considered the idea when they were writing the movie.', u'The Autobot Jazz is killed in the final battle. He was ironically one of the Autobot survivors in The Transformers: The Movie (1986), which featured the deaths of most of his comrades.', u'The prequel novel ""Transformers: Ghosts of Yesterday"" provides a more complete explanation than in the film as to how the Autobots and Decepticons learned of the AllSpark being on Earth. Both sides encounter Ghost-1, a spacecraft reverse-engineered from Megatron, and piloted by Sector Seven astronauts. Both sides learn of the AllSpark and Megatron being on Earth, and have a battle that results in Ghost-1\'s destruction, but steers them towards Earth.', u'Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman decided to kill off Jazz, as he was the third most popular Autobot.', u'When Mojo the dog pees on Ironhide\'s foot, he makes a comment about ""that\'s going to rust."" In Transformers: Dark of the Moon (2011), Ironhide dies by Sentinel Primes\' rust gun.', u""While Jazz does not survive the final battle, a Jazz toy released from Hasbro to commemorate the film mentioned his being rebuilt into a tougher (and better-looking) frame. He is seen alive and well in the Japanese manga adaptation of Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen (2009), where he participates in the Giza Guerilla, killing Long Haul and impaling Megatron's left leg with his new sword to stop him from reaching Sam, but is thrown into some ruins, where he spends the remainder of the battle fighting Decepticon protoforms."", u'According to Roberto Orci, Ron and Judy Witwicky learned the truth about the Transformers between this film and Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen (2009).', u'Megatron meets his end when Sam pushes the AllSpark (described in the film as ""raw power"") into his chest. This is a tribute to The Transformers: The Movie (1986) (Hot Rod uses the Matrix\'s power to destroy Unicron), as well as Beast Wars: Transformers (1996) (the Predacon Rampage gets raw energon shoved right through his chest).', u'At the end of the film, the remains of the fallen Decepticons are dumped into the Laurentian Abyss, in the Atlantic Ocean. Ironically, in The Transformers (1984) the Decepticons had as their lair an underwater abyss.', u'There is a notorious scene in The Transformers: The Movie (1986) where Spike Witwicky swears during a battle (""Oh, shit... what are we going to do now?""). In this film, Sam Witwicky yells ""Oh, shit!"" when he encounters a Decepticon for the first time, and when Frenzy\'s head is sliced in half ""Oh, shit!"" are his last words.', u""Barricade is last seen in the highway chase to Mission City. The movie's comic adaptation mentions a brief fight between Barricade and Optimus Prime, ending with Prime hurling Barricade into a concrete pillar. Barricade went on to survive and appear in the film sequels."", u'In 1973 Steven Spielberg was considered to direct Superman (1978), and in 1998 Michael Bay was considered to direct Man of Steel (2013). This film contains tributes to the original Superman (1978): Both films feature similar locations (a dying planet, the Arctic, an underground base, and the Hoover Dam).A glowing green artifact from another world plays a prominent part.A scene is directly copied where Starscream flies towards the Dam.Optimus Prime catches a falling Sam the same way Superman saves Lois Lane (both even say the same line).Starscream, like Superman, flies into space at the end.', u'Megatron crashed in the Arctic and was frozen there for centuries. This is the third time in the saga that Transformers have been featured buried in the Arctic. The first was The Transformers (1984) when the Transformer Jetfire was discovered, and the second was Transformers: Cybertron (2005) where a Decepticon prison was breached.', u'In every Transformers live action installment, Optimus rips a Decepticon/bounty hunter. In this movie, the character is Bonecrusher.', u""In the film, Sam is the one who defeats Megatron with the AllSpark. However in the film's video game adaptation, Megatron is instead defeated by the AllSpark in a similar fashion by Optimus Prime."", u""The phone numbers for the Mike's Towing truck (seen during the climax) are 1-800-555-0199 and 1-800-555-MIKE (555-6453).""]","[u'Australia::12 June 2007 (Sydney)\n (premiere)', u'Italy::21 June 2007 (Taormina Film Festival)', u'UK::22 June 2007 (London)\n (premiere)', u'USA::27 June 2007 (Los Angeles Film Festival)', u'Australia::28 June 2007', u'Indonesia::28 June 2007', u'Italy::28 June 2007', u'South Korea::28 June 2007', u'Malaysia::28 June 2007', u'Netherlands::28 June 2007 (limited)', u'New Zealand::28 June 2007', u'Philippines::28 June 2007', u'Singapore::28 June 2007', u'Thailand::28 June 2007', u'Taiwan::28 June 2007', u'Finland::29 June 2007 (limited)', u'Croatia::29 June 2007 (Zagreb)', u'Canada::2 July 2007', u'Hungary::3 July 2007', u'USA::3 July 2007', u'Belgium::4 July 2007 (Wilkinson American Movie Day)\n (premiere)', u'Denmark::4 July 2007', u'Egypt::4 July 2007', u'Spain::4 July 2007', u'Finland::4 July 2007', u'Kuwait::4 July 2007', u'Netherlands::4 July 2007', u'Norway::4 July 2007', u'Russia::4 July 2007', u'Sweden::4 July 2007', u'Bahrain::5 July 2007', u'Kazakhstan::5 July 2007', u'Portugal::5 July 2007', u'Ukraine::5 July 2007', u'Uruguay::5 July 2007', u'Bulgaria::6 July 2007', u'Romania::6 July 2007', u'Turkey::6 July 2007', u'Lithuania::7 July 2007', u'China::11 July 2007', u'Greece::12 July 2007', u'Israel::12 July 2007', u'Brazil::18 July 2007', u'Argentina::19 July 2007', u'Chile::19 July 2007', u'Panama::19 July 2007', u'Peru::19 July 2007', u'Colombia::20 July 2007', u'Ecuador::20 July 2007', u'Mexico::20 July 2007', u'Venezuela::20 July 2007', u'South Africa::20 July 2007', u'Belgium::25 July 2007', u'Switzerland::25 July 2007 (French speaking region)', u'France::25 July 2007', u'Japan::25 July 2007 (Chiyoda, Tokyo)\n (premiere)', u'Hong Kong::26 July 2007', u'UK::27 July 2007', u'Ireland::27 July 2007', u'Germany::1 August 2007', u'Austria::3 August 2007', u'Estonia::3 August 2007', u'India::4 August 2007', u'Japan::4 August 2007', u'Iceland::8 August 2007', u'Pakistan::10 August 2007', u'Slovenia::16 August 2007', u'Slovakia::16 August 2007', u'Poland::17 August 2007', u'Latvia::24 August 2007', u'China::September 2007 (IMAX version)', u'Australia::21 September 2007 (IMAX version)', u'Canada::21 September 2007 (IMAX version)', u'UK::21 September 2007 (IMAX version)', u'South Korea::21 September 2007 (IMAX version)', u'New Zealand::21 September 2007 (IMAX version)', u'Taiwan::21 September 2007 (IMAX version)', u'USA::21 September 2007 (IMAX version)', u'Netherlands::13 October 2007 (IMAX version)']",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Eastwood\'s response was that the movie was about the marines who raised the flag on Mount Suribachi. He went on to explain that although African-Americans did fight on Iwo Jima, the Marine Corps was segregated during WWII, and none of the men who raised the flag were black. Eastwood finally told Lee to ""shut his face"". Through the media, Lee responded that Eastwood was being an angry old man. Lee was filming Miracle at St. Anna (2008) at the time, a film about four black soldiers fighting WWII in Italy.', u'The scene in which a sailor falls from a ship and is left in the water as the fleet steams toward Iwo Jima actually happened. The incident is described in ""Iwo"" by Richard Wheeler, himself a veteran of the fighting. Quote: ""According to Coast Guardsman Chet Hack of LST 763: \'We got the man-overboard signal from the ship ahead of us. We turned to port to avoid hitting him and threw him a life preserver, but had orders not to stop. We could not hold up 24 ships for one man. Looking back, we could see him waving his arms, and it broke our hearts that we couldn\'t help him. We hoped that one of our destroyers or other small men-of-war that were cruising around to protect us would pick him up, but we never heard that they did.\' ""', u'Clint Eastwood chose to film a large part of the movie in Iceland.', u'Some battle shots in the movie were made by placing Sony HVR-Z1U video cameras inside prop .50 caliber ammo cases and having extras run around with them. Clint Eastwood called these ""trashcan shots"".', u'Actual Marines from the 5th Marines were used as extras during filming aboard ship as well as the the training work up. The extras who were actual Marines can be best seen climbing up and down the cargo nets.', u'Clint Eastwood tried to option ""Flags of Our Fathers"" after the book by James Bradley and Ron Powers was published in May 2000. However, Steven Spielberg had already bought the rights that summer, and in early 2001, had assigned its adaptation to the screenwriter William Broyles Jr.. Spielberg wasn\'t satisfied with the resulting screenplay and it laid dormant until he met with Eastwood at the Governor\'s Ball after the 2004 Oscar. After that, Eastwood took charge as the director with Spielberg as the producer.', u'The original of the top photograph in the stack of Japanese atrocities is held in the Australian War Memorial. It is dated 24 October 1943, was taken in Aitape, New Guinea, and shows Sergeant Leonard G. Siffleet, about to be beheaded with a sword by Yasuno Chikao.', u'Actor Jesse Bradford on working with director Eastwood, ""I heard rumors that he really does two takes, but I had a friend who was going into a Clint Eastwood movie, I wouldn\'t say he does two takes - I would say he does one. The average is probably two, but the number of times we only did one was overwhelming. It\'s kind of cool because, as an actor, it forces you to be on your game. With this movie, I learned really quickly to be very clear on what I thought were the most important aspects of the scene and how I wanted those aspects to come off, and then practice how I was going to make sure they did, because if I only got one shot, I didn\'t want to be the guy who was always asking for another take. I didn\'t want to waste my bullets in that department.""', u'\'Flags of Our Fathers\' cost $55 million although it was originally budgeted at $80 million. In a 2006 interview Paul Haggis stated that Clint Eastwood had shot the movie in just over 50 days, or nearly half the original shooting schedule. Variety subsequently downgraded the price-tag to $55 million. The budget for the companion piece Letters from Iwo Jima (2006) was officially credited at $20 million but again, according to Variety, the actual cost was ""under $70 million"" for both movies combined (this would place the cost of \'Letters\' as $15 million). It is possible that WB inflated the budget as part of its campaign when it became evident that \'Letters\' had Academy Award potential (the same thing happened in 2004 with \'Million Dollar Baby\'). As of April 2007 \'Flags\' and \'Letters\' had a combined worldwide theatrical gross of $135 million, with \'Flags\' having performed, according to Variety, ""very strongly"" in its home video bow.', u""George Grizzard's final film project."", u'Jared Leto turned down a key role in order to commit his time to his band, Thirty Seconds to Mars.', u'The story about the flag raising being posed was true. It was started, ironically, by Joe Rosenthal himself. He did not know he had taken the famous photograph until he returned to the States. He did however take a second photograph of the Marines gathered around the flag. When people asked if he had posed the photograph he, thinking they were referring to the second photograph said ""Of course"". It was only after seeing the first photograph that he realized they were referring to that photograph and not the second one.', u""The Marine Corps announced on June 23, 2016 that John Bradley is not one of the flag-raisers in Joe Rosenthal's photograph. The Marine Corps also stated that after reviewing the identities of the six flag-raisers in the photograph, the sixth flag raiser was identified as Cpl. Harold Schultz."", u'David Rasche appears in the film in a cameo role. Rasche is famous for his lampoon of Clint Eastwood\'s ""Dirty Harry"" character in the sitcom Sledge Hammer! (1986). Eastwood is known for his sense of humor and apparently liked the show.', u'Bradley Cooper auditioned for one of the leading roles. He later played the lead in another Clint Eastwood film, American Sniper (2014), which was also a biopic about a soldier who struggles with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and has difficulty adjusting to life after war.', u'The newspapers containing the famous photograph are, in order of being delivered, the New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, the Hartford Courant, the San Antonio Express, and lastly the Washington Post.', u'The film was shipped to theaters under the code-name ""Montana"". Also, the first reel was shipped separately from the other seven to further prevent piracy.', u""David Patrick Kelly plays President 'Harry S Truman'. Kelly also played a supporting role on Twin Peaks (1990), where Michael Ontkean plays the town sheriff, whose name is also Harry S Truman."", u'The scene with Bill Genaust and Joe Rosenthal just as the flag is about to be raised and the comment "" I wish I could have seen their faces"" is incorrect. According to the real Joe Rosenthal, it was Genaust that told him the flag was being raised as Rosenthal has his back to the flag photographing the naval fleet. In the movie this is reversed. When told about the flag being raised, Rosenthal turned and snapped the picture. He did not know what he had taken until he was shown the developed picture after returning to the States.', u'Barry Pepper and Harve Presnell also appeared in another WWII film, Saving Private Ryan (1998).', u'Two actors in the film have been linked before. Len Cariou, who played Mr. Beech, and George Hearn, who played Walter Gust. Cariou originated the title role of Sweeney Todd on Broadway was succeeded in the part by Hearn.', u'The iconic photograph that forms the basis of the film is actually misleading. The flag was raised on the fifth day of the battle for Iwo Jima. It would take another 35 days before the Americans could claim that the island was theirs.', u'Originally intended as a vehicle for Steven Spielberg, even though the director had covered similar territory with Saving Private Ryan (1998).', u'Shot over a period of 61 days.', u'Earned $2.7 million less than its companion piece Letters from Iwo Jima (2006) which also had the disadvantage of being shot entirely in Japanese.', u""Ryan Phillippe prepared for his role by spending time with his character's son."", u'Costume designer Deborah Hopper had to come up with over 500 costumes for the stars and all the extras.', u""Clint Eastwood would deliberately not tell his actors where all the special effects were rigged to explode in order to perfectly capture their look of surprise. This was done with the actors' safety firmly in mind."", u'The father of sound effects man Alan Robert Murray actually was at the Battle of Iwo Jima but never talked about it with his son.', u'Pre-production began on the film when Million Dollar Baby (2004) was about to start filming.', u""Adam Beach nearly missed out on being cast as Ira Hayes as he was laid up in bed with flu when the call from Clint Eastwood came through. Only some frantic lobbying by Beach's lawyer helped him secure the role."", u""The reason for taking the second picture is because they wanted a bigger flag so it could be seen by the naval ships off shore and also used as a simple recruiting poster-it then became and still is (72 years later) regarded by photojournalists the world over as the most famous photograph ever taken!

One of them was when the group found one of the terrorists in Norway. The target was exiting a bus with a pregnant woman, and they killed him. The authorities tracked down the Agents' license plate number and arrested them, but it was later revealed that they had shot the wrong man. He wasn't even Palestinian, but a Moroccan waiter, and the pregnant woman was his wife. Another hit was executed with two of the Agents dressed in drag, one of whom was Ehud Barak, who went on to become Prime Minister of Israel in 1999."", u""During the scene where Avner's (Eric Bana's) team joins up with the Israeli commandos in Beirut, one of the commandos introduces himself as Ehud Barak. Barak was a member of the most elite commando force of the Israeli army, sayeret matkal, before becoming a politician and eventually Israel's Prime Minister."", u'Actor and Director Mathieu Kassovitz had left strict instructions to his agent that he would not take any acting assignments at all, as he wanted to fully concentrate on directing features. However, this film was an exception. According to him, he accepted the role of Robert, because he jumped at the chance to work with Steven Spielberg.', u'Avner is referred to as a ""sabra"" more than once. This is an Israeli term for a native born Jew, as opposed to an immigrant. ""Sabra"" originally referred to a tough kind of cactus (Opuntia cactus) which grew out in the desert.', u'The ending of the movie conflicts with the real-life one, where the Mossad Agents successfully bombed the mastermind of the Munich killings, along with his four bodyguards and three innocent bystanders. They also injured sixteen innocent bystanders.', u'This film is based on George Jonas\' book ""Vengeance"". It purports to tell the true story of vengeance taken against the Black September terrorists using a supposed former Mossad Agent named Yuval Aviv as Jonas\' main source.

Aviv counters this by saying that they would deny him anyway.', u'The role of Avner was written with Eric Bana in mind.', u'The time span between the start of production to the release date in December of 2005 was less than six months.', u'The film crews called the shooting of the movie as a ""race against the clock"". In order to have the film ready by Christmas for Academy Awards consideration, Steven Spielberg and Editor Michael Kahn devised an editing schedule in which: 1) All of the scenes in Malta and Hungary shot in twelve weeks were edited on the spot. Each day, Spielberg would review an edited scene shot two days earlier. 2) Two copies of the edited scene were sent out, one to John Williams for music and the other to Ben Burtt for sound effects. 3) The Paris and New York City scenes were edited two weeks after photography, and the final cut was readied after another two weeks.', u""In the opening segment of the movie, there is a brief shot of two Israeli girls watching television appearing twice.

Masada is of great significance in Jewish history, as it is a fortress Hebrew rebels held out in against Roman troops. Many of the rebels were killed or committed suicide, but it relates to the themes of death and resistance in this movie."", u""The role of Ephraim was intended for Sir Ben Kingsley, but he backed out, due to a change to the ending of The Terminal (2004). It caused the start of the production to be pushed back a few weeks later, thus conflicting with Kingsley's work schedule on Oliver Twist (2005)."", u'Steven Spielberg was going to direct this film for a 2003 or 2004 release, but shelved it when Tom Cruise became available, so the duo could work on War of the Worlds (2005) instead.', u'After getting the rights to George Jonas\' book ""Vengeance"", Steven Spielberg commissioned three scripts: one from David Webb Peoples and Janet Peoples, one from Charles Randolph, and one from Eric Roth. Roth\'s script was chosen and subsequently revised by Tony Kushner, after Kushner first declined to co-write the screenplay. He felt it was too controversial and too complicated to be his first screenplay for a feature film.', u'The quote that Papa shares with Avner when telling him that he is being hunted is loosely taken from Ecclesiastes 9:11: ""I returned and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour to men of skill; but time and chance happen to them all.""', u'To create the blue pastel effect in the Beirut scenes, special Fuji film stocks were used exclusively. The notable challenge for that was that it has to be processed in a Fuji lab (in this case in France) since most Technicolor labs use Kodak calibrations and a reprint is required if there was a case of a print printed to the wrong specifications.', u'The film was not shot in Munich or Germany at all. The Munich scenes were mostly shot in Budapest, Hungary.', u'A crew truck imported from Germany and laden with heavy equipment, mysteriously caught fire during shooting in Malta, sparking fears of a possible terrorist attack.

Many of the stores and restaurants were built by the construction crews that built the actual mall and airport stores for the respective companies, and some had fully-functioning equipment, such as ovens and cash registers.

That parachute was called a T-1, and as it deployed out of its pack the canopy came out first, then the suspension lines and finally the risers connected to the harness. With this design, by the time all of the lines are fully deployed the canopy has completely filled with air, acting as a brake for the lines, causing the paratrooper to come to an abrupt stop at the end of the deployment. The heavier the paratrooper and the more equipment he was carrying, the more sudden the stop or shock. Modern-design parachutes deploy in the exact opposite way (lines first, then canopy), greatly reducing the opening shock. On D-Day, not only were the leg bags a new ""innovation"", with which the paratroopers hadn\'t practiced, but frequently the aircraft were flying much faster than expected (to avoid flak) and the shock of opening was, therefore, increased.', u'David Schwimmer ended up on crutches when he injured his leg during boot camp training.', u'Marc Ryan-Jordan (Private Julian) claimed that he met a man on the set who was paid two hundred pounds to roll cigarettes every day.', u'Around seven hundred authentic weapons and almost four hundred rubber prop weapons were used in production.', u'The BBC, despite being a co-funder of the series, still had to pay 22.7 million dollars for the broadcast rights.

In the shooting script, Malcolm allows Marrow to go to Hill House because it will give him the study and results he needs for the last chapter of his book entitled ""Fear and Performance"". In the script\'s alternate ending, Marrow publishes the book and dedicates it in memory of those who died in Hill House: Rene Crain, Carolyn Crain, Eleanor Vance and Luke Sanderson. David Marrow\'s book being published is cut out of the movie, though Malcolm does say ""fear and performance"" to David when originally trying to talk him out of doing his research.', u'The ghost of Hugh Crain was originally supposed to emerge from the fireplace and try to attack Nell.

In the film, Nell says ""In the dark"" ahead of Mrs. Dudley when she repeats her quote to Theo in her bedroom for comedic effect.', u""In the original shooting script, David Marrow's first name was actually Jim. The name David is taken from an omitted character from the script named David Watts, who was a guest Marrow invites to Hill House for the study. The absence of Watts takes up most of the shooting script when Nell sees Watts's car drive up and she later finds the keys to his Toyota by the fireplace, but Watts himself doesn't arrive inside the house and the guests split up to look for him. Near the end, when Marrow, Theo and Luke look for Nell when she re-enters Hill House, they find the dead body of Watts held in the hand of the man statue in the greenhouse pool."", u'In the theatrical trailer, there is a scene where Nell asks Theo if she ever kept something to herself because she was afraid and Theo says, ""All the time.""

Sherri Stoner liked the idea of an aged cartoon character, because an aged cartoon star would know the secrets of other cartoons and ""have the dirt on them"".', u'Sherri Stoner invented Dot\'s full name (Princess Angelina Contessa Louisa Francesca Banana Fanna Bo Besca III) using the song ""The Name Game"" by Shirley Ellis, and also patterned it after Pippi Longstocking\'s full name: Pippilotta Delicatessa Windowshade Mackrelmint Ephraim\'s Daughter Longstocking.', u""Throughout the series, Dot Warner's voice gets slightly deeper each episode, and is also evident in the movie Animaniacs: Wakko's Wish (1999).

Originally, they were going to be ducks named Yakki, Smakki, and Wakki, but this idea was canned (it was thought to be too similar to DuckTales (1987)), and the three were changed into platypi, then into Bosko-like inkblots. Along the way, they gained a female friend. Finally, Yakki became Yakko, Smakki, and Wakki were combined into Wakko, and the female friend was named Dot, and made their sister."", u""Whenever Nathan Ruegger (Skippy) had to laugh as part of the script, but couldn't laugh convincingly enough, his dad Tom Ruegger would come into the studio to tickle him."", u'The C.E.O., Thaddeus Plotz\'s last name is Yiddish for ""explode"".', u""Rob Paulsen modelled Pinky's voice after Frank Spencer, the protagonist from the BBC sitcom Some Mothers Do 'Ave 'Em (1973)."", u'The series was made with a higher production value than standard television animation.

However, when Bob Daley, who ran the studio at the time, saw the balloon, he thought that for some reason, Mickey Mouse was sitting on top of the tower, and he requested it to be removed. It was removed, but not before Paul Rugg took a photo of the balloon.', u'In an ""Animaniacs"" tribute by Doug Walker (The Nostalgia Critic), who had done a video listing eleven of the ""naughtiest"" moments in the show, was curious as to how the writers were able to get so many ""naughty"" jokes past the censors (such as the famed ""fingerprints"" joke). The consensus from writers Tom Ruegger, Sheri Stoner, Paul Rugg, and John P. McCann was essentially, ""We have no idea.""', u'One of the regulars (Ralph the Guard) was a recurring character in the later episodes of Tiny Toon Adventures (1990). Also, several other characters have made cameo appearances, and the theme song from it shows up occasionally as well.

The next scene shows Miller and the others walking through a meadow on foot with no vehicle in sight. This is due to the fact that the scene which shows how Miller and the men lose the Jeep was deleted from the final cut. Later in the film, Miller mentions something about losing ""most of their ammo.""

(""Oxford History of the American People"", 1965 states: ""The court, with a majority of Southerners, was so impressed by the old statesman\'s eloquence, that it ordered Cinque and the other Negroes set free, and they were returned to Africa. The ironic epilogue is that Cinque, once home, set himself up as a slave trader."") However, recent research disproves these rumors (Joseph Yannielli, ""Cinque the Slave Trader: Some New Evidence on an Old Controversy"", Common-Place, Vol. 10, October 2009). It is believed that Cinque, and the other freed prisoners from the Amistad, returned to Africa in 1842, at which time, Cinque\'s home country of Sierra Leone was being torn apart by civil war. Cinque and his companions from the Amistad kept in contact with members from the local Christian mission, and this contact provides today\'s researchers with pieces of information regarding his later life. After a while, Cinque left the area to trade along the coast of West Africa. Most stories of his later life are simply rumor. George Thompson\'s ""Thompson in Africa: or, An account of the missionary labors, sufferings..."" (1852) puts forward the idea that Cinque had moved to Jamaica. Others held that he had become a merchant, or a chief, perhaps trading in slaves. However, this rumor of Cinque engaging in the slave trade has been seriously disputed. The origin of these claims appears to be statements made by early twentieth century Author William A. Owens, who claimed to have seen letters from AMA missionaries, suggesting Cinque was a slave trader. While it is likely that some of the freed Amistad prisoners probably did engage in the slave trade upon their return to Africa, today, most historians agree that Cinque was not amongst them, and these claims are false.']","[u'USA::4 December 1997 (Washington, D.C.)\n (premiere)', u'USA::10 December 1997 (limited)', u'USA::25 December 1997', u'Sweden::4 February 1998 (G\xf6teborg Film Festival)', u'South Korea::14 February 1998', u'Australia::19 February 1998', u'Hong Kong::19 February 1998', u'Brazil::20 February 1998', u'Spain::20 February 1998', u'Belgium::25 February 1998', u'Switzerland::25 February 1998 (French speaking region)', u'France::25 February 1998', u'Germany::26 February 1998', u'Slovakia::26 February 1998', u'Switzerland::27 February 1998 (German speaking region)', u'Denmark::27 February 1998', u'UK::27 February 1998', u'Ireland::27 February 1998', u'Norway::27 February 1998', u'Peru::27 February 1998', u'Poland::27 February 1998', u'Turkey::27 February 1998', u'Japan::28 February 1998', u'Portugal::4 March 1998\n (premiere)', u'Hungary::5 March 1998', u'Netherlands::5 March 1998', u'Finland::6 March 1998', u'Iceland::6 March 1998', u'Mexico::6 March 1998', u'Argentina::12 March 1998', u'Slovenia::12 March 1998', u'Italy::13 March 1998', u'Portugal::13 March 1998', u'Sweden::13 March 1998', u'Philippines::18 March 1998', u'Thailand::20 March 1998', u'Singapore::2 April 1998', u'Kuwait::27 April 1998', u'Uruguay::22 May 1998', u'Greece::11 March 2001 (DVD premiere)']",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Afterward, the real Balto and his team were sold to a movie producer named Sol Lesser, who made a movie called Balto's Race to Nome (1925), eulogizing Balto. After that, the team was sold again and put on exhibit as a kind of curiosity show. The dogs were abused, neglected, and forgotten, until a Cleveland businessman named George Kimbal, with the help of Cleveland school children, bought the six remaining dogs for the then astounding sum of two thousand dollars, which they raised in two weeks. The dogs were brought to the Cleveland Zoo, and lived out their lives in peace. When Balto died in 1933, he was stuffed, and put on display in the Cleveland Museum of Natural History."", u'The real hero of the 1925 serum run was Togo. The twelve-year-old husky led his sled dog team through 260 miles of blowing Alaskan blizzard to deliver emergency diphtheria serum to Nome. Balto received most of the fame, because he led the final 55 miles.', u'There are many differences between the movie and what really happened, such as: *The sled run to get the medicine was actually a relay, and Balto was only the leader of the last team to carry the medicine to Nome. The longest and most hazardous distance was traveled by the team led by Togo. *This film portrays Balto as a wolf hybrid. Balto was actually a purebred Siberian Husky. *Balto was never an outcast as shown by the film, but was instead born in a kennel owned by the famous musher Leonhard Seppala, where he grew up until he was deemed fit for pulling a sled, Seppala was also the owner of Togo, whom he personally used during the relay, Balto was instead used by one of his workers, Gunnar Kasaan. *The real Balto was neutered by Seppala when he was only a few months old, meaning the puppies he has in the sequels never came to be.', u""Jenna's character design was based on Audrey Hepburn."", u""Kasaan staggered into Nome at 5:30 A.M. on February 2, 1925.

There were concerns about his failing health in 1933, until a kindly veterinarian, Dr. R.R. Powell (a member and trustee of the Cleveland, Ohio Balto Committee), offered to ease Balto\'s suffering. Wilson accepted for the zoo, and carefully moved Balto over to Dr. Powell\'s animal hospital. Powell insisted on caring for Balto free of charge, stating it was an honor to care for him in his last hours. On Tuesday, March 14, 1933, he injected Balto with a drug to ""put him to sleep"". Balto died at 2:15 PM, under the loving care of Dr. Powell and Curley Wilson. He had died of natural causes... old age.

This led to the closure and disestablishment of Amblimation, but it quickly garnered a strong cult following, and is now regarded as a classic.

It was the last major outbreak of the disease in North America, and so, out of the Great Race of Mercy to Nome, was born the modern sled race we call the Iditarod.', u'After the mission\'s success, Balto and Gunnar Kasaan became celebrities. A statue of Balto, sculpted by Frederick Roth, was erected in New York City\'s Central Park on December 17, 1925, just ten months after Balto\'s arrival in Nome. Balto himself was present for the monument\'s unveiling. The statue is located on the main path leading north from the Tisch Children\'s Zoo. In front of the statue a low-relief slate plaque depicts Balto\'s sled team, and bears the following inscription: ""Dedicated to the indomitable spirit of the sled dogs that relayed antitoxin six hundred miles over rough ice, across treacherous waters, through Arctic blizzards from Nenana to the relief of stricken Nome in the Winter of 1925.

He did record his part, but his voice-over was subsequently discarded, and the role went to experienced voice actor Jim Cummings.', u'Balto, who has suffered bad press as ""just a freight dog"", surpassed himself in the Great Serum Run. When Gunnar Kasaan became lost on the ice of the Topkok River, it was Balto who scented out the right trail (in fifty mile per hour winds) and brought the team back safely. If it had been left to Kasaan, the entire team would have plunged through the ice.', u'During his travels in the east, Seppala left some of his animals with Harry Wheeler of Quebec, who began breeding them. All currently American Kennel Club-registered Huskies can trace their ancestry back to this foundation stock.', u'Today, the 1925 serum run is commemorated by the dog sled race known as the Iditarod.', u'In the race to see which dog is the fastest for the team, Steele calls Balto ""Lobo"", which is Spanish for wolf.', u'After the team\'s hurried arrival in Nome, on the early morning of February 2 (5:30 A.M. AKST) Gunnar Kaasen halted the team in front of the Miners and Merchants Bank on Front Street. Dazed, exhausted, and nearly overwhelmed from the ordeal, he stumbled up to the front of the team, where a few witnesses said he collapsed, muttering (about Balto) ""Damn fine dog.""', u""In New York City's Central Park stands a bronze statue of Balto, paid for by penny collections from children. Many Siberian Husky aficionados resent the fact that it was this dog, rather than Togo, whose likeness is sculpted.

Kaasen and his dogs, led by Balto, traveled 106 miles through subzero temperatures and icy blizzards and arrived in Nome in the early morning hours of February 2, 1925.

The text translates as: ""Just what did you think you were shooting at, are you crazy? With this rifle you could have shot me! You came that close to shooting me!"" The second soldier then says something that includes ""Entschuldigung"", which is ""apologies"" in German. The NCO then responds with, ""What do we call excuses here? You are certainly crazy!""

He consented and was said to be tickled by the homage.', u'According to the book ""Billy Gibbons: Rock & Roll Gearhead"", ZZ Top was hanging around the set, and was asked to be the town band. During one take, the camera broke. While waiting for the camera to be repaired, Michael J. Fox asked if they would play ""Hey Good Lookin\'"" which they did. Afterwards, more requests were played.

In Back to the Future (1985), the name on the manure truck from 1955 read ""D.

It appears that multiple generations of rowdy defiant Hill Valley residents have consistently wanted to kill the stern ""by the book"" Strickland men, who became authority figures throughout the decades.', u'The train station is near the site of the station built for Pale Rider (1985), another Clint Eastwood movie. The two halves of the ""Pale Rider"" station became new buildings in ""Hill Valley"".

With the help of Chicago attorney Elbert Henry Gary, he created a monopoly in the U.S. wire industry in 1898 with American Steel and Wire Company, which was sold in 1901 to J.P. Morgan in a deal (also negotiated by Gary) to become part of the new U.S. Steel conglomerate.1. Gates was a founder of The Texas Company which became the Texaco oil company.

In Support Your Local Gunfighter (1971), Doc Schultz (Dub Taylor), who is already quite drunk, is similarly seen drinking a single shot of whiskey at the bar before immediately passing out, after which, the bartender concocts a special drink of the Doc\'s own design to revive him quickly.

There are a few interesting things to note: Not counting the time Doc travelled by himself, the DeLorean spent nearly seventy-one years (on its own time scale) from its first time travel to its destruction. By the time Marty made his ultimate return to 1985, he was approximately fourteen days, three hours, and twenty-seven minutes older than he should have been; Jennifer, on the other hand, is seven hours and twenty-six minutes younger than she should have been. Another interesting conclusion is a point of contention. There are two theories, one of which drops the last item. On November 12, 1955, between the time Biff arrived (or 6 a.m., whichever came later) and 6:38 p.m. (the time he left), there were four DeLoreans present in Hill Valley (ordered from its point of view): (1) The instance when Marty was trapped in 1955 in the original movie. (2) The instance when Biff came to 1955 to give himself the almanac. (3) The instance when Marty and Doc came back to 1955 to take the almanac back. (4) The instance when it was waiting in the abandoned mine. Those who do not agree with (4) argue that according to the ""ripple effect"" timeline as presented in the films, there wouldn\'t be a DeLorean hidden by Doc in the mine until later that evening, when the lightning blast would accidentally send Doc back to 1885, thereby altering the timeline. It is *entirely true* that *we* do not ever witness a moment in the films where all four instances coexist, but the text ""ordered from its point of view"" above should hint at a solution. Once the DeLorean is in 1885, consider what it would detect (if it were in a position to witness the comings and goings of its former selves): over seventy years of peace, then (1) arrives, then (2) and (3) arrive in some order; (2) then leaves at 6:38 p.m., (3) leaves around 10 p.m., and (1) leaves at 10:04 p.m. (4) itself leaves soon after that. If we grant that all three of those instances (1-3) continue to exist in the ""final"" timeline, then there should be no problem accepting this theory. Still not convinced? Consider the one hundred-year gap near the end of this movie, when Marty takes the DeLorean on its final journey. Seventy years into it, for a few hours, there are four instances of the car.', u'The scene where Marty and Jennifer kiss on the porch was the only scene shot while Back to the Future Part II (1989) was being made.', u""Each movie in the trilogy has an early scene that foreshadows an event that occurs in the third act. In the first movie, a figure of a guy clinging to a clock is seen in Doc's lab which foreshadows the climax of the movie in which Doc clings to a clock in a similar way. In the second movie, Doc says that he wishes the post office was as punctual as the weather and at the end a post office man gives a letter to Marty in 1955 at the precise time Doc is sent to 1885. In the third movie, when Doc is explaining to Marty at the Clayton Ravine how the train is going to push the DeLorean to eighty-eight miles per hour, he laments that nobody is going to be there to witness it. At the end, Doc remains with Clara, and thus witnesses the event."", u'In the deleted scene (shown on DVD), Buford ""Mad Dog"" Tannen was supposed to shoot Marshal Strickland in the back, killing him. His son was present at the time. This was edited out of the final cut, as it was deemed too depressing. This is why Strickland\'s Deputy arrests Buford at the end of the movie, rather than Strickland himself. The Deputy\'s dialogue from the latter scene had to be re-dubbed to compensate for the change.', u'In Back to the Future Part II (1989), Biff watches A Fistful of Dollars (1964) in the alternative 1985, in which Clint Eastwood\'s character uses steel plating underneath his poncho. Marty (calling himself ""Clint Eastwood"") uses the hatch from a stove under his poncho in 1885. The sign at the train crossing in 1985 identifies the location (formerly Clayton Ravine) as ""Eastwood Ravine"" named for Marty\'s character.', u'In the mid 1990s, there was plans for Back to the Future Part IV. One discussed plot would have involved Doc and his family going to Roswell, New Mexico in 1947, with Michael J. Fox appearing only in a cameo role. In 2004, Michael J. Fox talked about doing Back to the Future Part IV, saying that he wanted Marty McFly to be a mentor to a different family.', u""Throughout the trilogy, the DeLorean, and its duplicates created via time travel make fifteen trips through time. They are: 1) Doc's dog, Einstein, is sent one minute into the future to test the machine. 2) Marty travels back to 1955 from 1985. 3) Marty returns to 1985 from 1955. 4) Doc travels past 2015 from 1985. 5) Doc travels to 2015 from the future to find the beginning of the unravelling of Marty's family. 6) Doc returns to 1985 from 2015. 7) Doc takes Marty and Jennifer forward to 2015 from 1985. 8) Biff travels from 2015 to 1955 to give himself the sports almanac, thus creating an alternate timeline. 9) Biff returns to 2015 from 1955. 10) Doc, Marty, and Jennifer return to the alternate 1985 from 2015. 11) Marty and Doc travel back to 1955 from the alternate 1985 to get the sports almanac from Biff. 12) Doc accidentally travels from 1955 to 1885 when the DeLorean is hit by lightning. 13) Marty travels from 1955 to 1885 to rescue Doc. 14) Marty returns to 1985 from 1885. 15) Doc and his family travel from the future to 1985 to introduce Marty and Jennifer to Jules and Verne, and to give Marty an undamaged photo of him and Doc Brown in front of the clock. Additional off screen time travelling has occurred, as stated by Doc Brown, but these are the fifteen confirmed travels."", u""In every film of the trilogy, there is a scene where Marty is knocked unconscious and awoken by someone resembling his mother, as he thinks the whole film a has been a dream. There is always a scene with him entering a public drinking place where Biff (or one of his relatives) enters calling for one of Marty's relations. There is always a scene with Marty being chased by someone resembling Biff (or Biff himself) and his gang (in Part I, he was on a skateboard; in Part II, he was on a hoverboard). The time machine always becomes unusable at some point. Characters related to Biff have been covered in manure in every film, and are always beaten up by Marty."", u'FRANCHISE TRADEMARK: In each of the three films, a common theme, is that Marty always ends up in a public drinking place, shortly after arriving at his time destination, and is confronted by a Tannen shouting ""Hey McFly!"" In Back to the Future (1985), shortly after Marty arrives in 1955 he walks into a caf\xe9 and is drinking a cup of coffee, while his father George is sitting next to him. Biff Tannen comes in and shouts ""Hey McFly!"", to which Marty acknowledges, but doesn\'t realize Biff is shouting at his father. In Back to the Future Part II (1989), shortly after arriving in 2015 with Doc, Marty enters the Caf\xe9 \'80s, when Griff Tannen (Biff\'s grandson) shouts ""Hey McFly!"" to Marty\'s future son (Marty, Jr.) who just entered after him. In this movie, shortly after arriving in 1885, Marty enters the saloon, and is confronted by Buford ""Mad Dog"" Tannen, who shouts ""Hey McFly!"" confusing Marty with Marty\'s great, great grandfather Seamus.', u'Michael Winslow (""Jones"" of Police Academy fame) performed the sound effects of Michael J. Fox\'s feet during the breakdancing sequence.', u""Early in 2008, several directors, including Steven Spielberg voted on an attraction room for Universal Hollywood, that would contain rare and old costumes and props. Two of the items pulled out from storage vaults were the miniatures of Doc's time travel train and the railroad version of the DeLorean. The full sized version of the time train can be seen at Universal Studios Orlando."", u""By the time it is destroyed, the time machine is made up of components of each era it visited in the films: 1980's DeLorean chassis, 2015 Mr. Fusion and flying conversion, 1955 vacuum tubes and transistors (replacing a burned out microchip), and 1885 train wheels."", u'Bob Gale owns two pieces of the destroyed DeLorean; the time circuit display, and a table lamp, made out of Mr. Fusion, by Special Effects Supervisor Michael Lantieri.', u""If the DeLorean was equipped with a time odometer which measured years travelling backwards or forwards in time incrementally (much like a standard odometer measures miles travelled forwards incrementally), it would have travelled a grand total of five hundred seventy years through time before being destroyed. Here's how the time odometer would have been measured (for the sake of simplicity, any short time hops, such as Einstein's one minute future jump in 1985, and Doc's one day future jump in 2015 will be ignored, as will the exact times for each jump listed): 1) 1985 to 1955 = thirty years (Marty's original trip to 1955). 2) 1955 to 1985 = sixty years (Marty's return to 1985). 3) 1985 to 2015 = ninety years (Doc's trip to 2015). 4) 2015 to 1985 = one hundred twenty years (Doc's return to 1985 to warn Marty and Jennifer). 5) 1985 to 2015 = one hundred fifty years (Doc, Marty, and Jennifer's trip to 2015). 6) 2015 to 1955 = two hundred ten years (Old Biff's trip to 1955 to give his younger self the Almanac). 7) 1955 to 2015 = two hundred seventy years (Old Biff's return). 8) 2015 to 1985A = three hundred years (Doc and Marty's trip to Alternate 1985). 9) 1985A to 1955 = three hundred thirty years (Doc and Marty's trip to 1955 to retrieve the Almanac and restore 1985 time line). 10) 1955 to 1885 = four hundred years (Doc's trip to 1885, when the DeLorean was struck by lightning). 11) 1955 to 1885 = four hundred seventy years (DeLorean was buried in 1885, and sat undisturbed for seventy years, before being unearthed in 1955, and used to travel to 1885). 12) 1885 to 1985 = five hundred seventy years (Marty's return to 1985, and final trip of the DeLorean)."", u'By the end of the trilogy, Marty, Biff/Griff, Doc, and Jennifer all get knocked out or pass out.', u'The person who has time travelled the farthest into the future is Clara Clayton. At the end of the film, when Marty asked Doc where he\'s headed ""Back to the future?"" Doc responds with ""Nope, already been there."" Clara was with him during the time travels, and assuming they visited the year 2015, she travelled one hundred thirty years into the future. Many believe the DeLorean travelled the farthest back to the past, but actually it\'s the hoverboard. Being from October 21, 2015, it travelled all the way to September 2, 1885, for a total of one hundred thirty years, one month and nineteen days.

This means that the clock tower operated for exactly seventy years, two months, seven days, two hours, and four minutes.', u""The film is the final chapter of the Back to the Future trilogy. However, an animated television series based on the trilogy premiered on September 14, 1991, and it ran for two seasons. The series took place after this movie, and it depicted the further adventures of Marty, Doc, Clara, their sons Jules and Verne, their family dog Einsten, and the DeLorean time machine is rebuilt, and is now voice-activated. In 2016, Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd unofficially return in their roles for a Back to the Future Part IV trailer, which was a parody of the trilogy, and the trailer saw Marty and Doc embarking on one last adventure.

However, when plans for a sequel were made by the studio, they chose to remain involved in the continuation of their creation, and even extended it to two sequels. Zemeckis has claimed that if he knew that he was going to make a sequel, he would have made sure that Marty's girlfriend Jennifer wasn't in the car at the end of the first film.

In Back to the Future (1985) George is shown drinking the punch before confronting Biff in the parking lot.

He praised the accuracy in handling the multiple time lines as what would really happen if time travel were possible. In Back to the Future: The Game, Carl Sagan is the alias used by Doc Brown when visiting Hill Valley in 1931.', u""The principal actors and actresses had committed to the sequels before any scripts were written. However, there was a stumbling block in negotiations with Crispin Glover (George McFly in Back to the Future (1985)), who stated that he was offered a monetary amount less than half of what Lea Thompson and Thomas F. Wilson were being paid to return. Crispin believed this was due to Producer Bob Gale taking exception to Crispin voicing his disapproval of the original ending of the first film (where the McFlys viewed money and material possessions as rewards), causing a script change. During sequel negotiations, Crispin's agent expressed to producers that Crispin wanted fair compensation, in addition to a script approval clause in his contract. Bob Gale refused to give in to either of these requests, instead offering a lower salary amount than the first offer. After Crispin turned down the lowball offer of one hundred twenty-five, Gale re-wrote the sequel script to lessen George McFly's screentime. Jeffrey Weissman was cast as George and, using molds of Crispin made on the set of the first film, was dressed in facial prosthetics to look like Crispin, so that they could incorporate excerpts from the original movie. All shots of Weissman either show him from behind, at a distance, upside down or with sunglasses, in effect, fooling audiences into believing that Crispin had taken part in the sequel."", u""During filming of the cut sequence where the McFly family gathers around the table in 2015, between takes they had an earthquake, and were afraid the props may have moved around too much to edit the scene seamlessly as Michael J.

When they decided to shoot Back to the Future Part II (1989), they had to clean the set up and restore it to the same condition it was in 1955. It cost more to rebuild, than it cost to build it from scratch.', u'The biggest effect of the picture is a camera trick called ""vistaglide"". There are four scenes that use the effect of the same actor interacting with themselves. The four scenes that were shot were Griff and 2015 Biff in the Cafe \'80s, the dinner sequence in 2015, 1955 Biff talking to 2015 Biff in the garage, and 1955 Doc talking with 1985 Doc. In order to create the dinner sequence with the vistaglide, the camera had to be divided into thirds and Michael had to come in three different times to play his older self, Marty, Jr., and his daughter Marlene. This is the first film to accomplish interaction between the same actor on the screen twice as two different characters. If you watch closely, you\'ll see that 2015 Biff\'s hand disappears during the scene in the garage.', u'On October 21, 2015 multiple theaters screened the movie, as that is the exact date Doc, Marty, and Jennifer travel to the future.', u""To commemorate the release of a 30th anniversary Back to the Future Blu-ray box-set, a short movie called Back to the Future: Doc Brown Saves the World (2015) was filmed with Christopher Lloyd reprising his role of Doc Brown.

He also added, ""they\'ve been around for years, it\'s just that parent groups haven\'t let toy manufacturers make them. But we got our hands on some and put them in the movie."" He was only joking, of course, but interestingly enough, Mattel (whose logo appeared on the hoverboard props) soon found themselves overwhelmed with callers asking where they could buy one. Although they looked pretty convincing in the movie, the hoverboards were simply wooden props attached to the actors and actresses feet. To make the boards fly, the actors were suspended by cables, which were then erased during post-production.', u'Elisabeth Shue was cast as Jennifer, and all the closing shots of Back to the Future (1985) were re-shot for the beginning of this film. Claudia Wells (Jennifer in Back to the Future (1985)) was unable to reprise her role, as she had stopped acting because her mother had been diagnosed with cancer. She returned to acting for the independent film Still Waters Burn (2008).', u'According to Michael J. Fox, he found out there was going to be a sequel to Back to the Future (1985) when he watched the VHS version and the words ""To be continued"" were added at the end. He immediately called his agent to make sure he was going to be in the sequel.', u'Robert Zemeckis considers this one of his favorite, and strangest films.', u'This movie was the most advanced film of its time for using ""every trick in the book"", according to Robert Zemeckis. It was in the late 1980s when the concept of CGI was starting. However, in the film, very few CGI effects were actually needed.', u""The soda menu at Cafe '80s listed four types of Pepsi products: Original, Diet, Max, and Perfect.

This was written so that Christopher Lloyd would not have to constantly wear old-age make-up for the two sequels, since he would primarily be portraying the 1985 incarnation of Doc.', u'Originally, only one sequel was planned. The script for this sequel, known as ""Paradox"" included all the elements of this movie and Back to the Future Part III (1990), but compressed to fit into one movie. However, it was revealed with the release of the DVD set, that there was an even earlier script which involved Marty meeting up with his parents while they\'re college students in the sixties. (This was probably dropped, because no matter how you cut it, George and Lorraine wouldn\'t have been in college during the ""Protest Era"", they were too old.)', u'Although Marty McFly comments that his son ""looks just like him"", there is one notable difference between the two (aside from a faulty jacket sleeve and a white t-shirt): Marty McFly, Jr. has brown eyes, whereas his father doesn\'t (this can be seen most clearly in the scene with Griff in Cafe \'80s).', u'In the hot tub scene, the film Biff and his lady friends are watching is A Fistful of Dollars (1964), starring Clint Eastwood.

Fleischer also provides the off-screen voice of Biff's grandmother."", u""After Biff gets his cane stuck in the DeLorean upon returning to 2015, he starts to thrash around in pain, apparently having a hard time from the exertion. Robert Zemeckis has stated that Biff was experiencing the same thing Marty did at the dance in the first movie: fading out of history. The idea was that, by going back in time to give the sports almanac to his younger self, Biff had somehow altered his own future so that he no longer existed in the year 2015. According to script drafts, Biff's wife (Marty's mother) had shot and killed the abusive Biff in 1996. A deleted scene in the DVD extras makes this much clearer as we actually see Biff vanish."", u'In this movie a disguised ""1985 Doc Brown"" holds a conversation with his 1955 counterpart. 1985 Doc is wearing a brown trench coat and hat. If you look carefully in Back to the Future (1985), you can see a man dressed exactly like this (and therefore, presumably Doc) walking away shortly before the clock tower scene. In the DVD commentary, it is explained that this was not intentional, as the script for Back to the Future Part II (1989) hadn\'t even been written at the time that they filmed the first one.', u""Biff's alternate 1985 incarnation was loosely inspired by Donald J. Trump, while Lorraine's was based upon Tammy Faye Bakker."", u'Doc expresses his regret that he will never be able to visit his favorite historical era, the Old West, and suggests that instead he should devote himself to studying women. He gets to do both in Back to the Future Part III (1990).', u'Despite what some believe, the voice of Marlene McFly was not that of Michael J. Fox, but rather voice actress Grey DeLisle.', u'In front of the entrance to the Biff Tannen Museum, there is a sign that reads ""Smoking Required"".', u'In the original script, Pa Peabody was to have been evaluated at a mental institution for claiming to have seen a spacecraft (the DeLorean in the first film). As soon as he is released, he sees a flying DeLorean and fires his shotgun at it, damaging the time circuits. This is the reason the destination time display flickers over to read 01.01.1885. On the region one DVD commentary, Bob Gale mentions the scene was dropped when Will Hare was not available to return for the sequel.', u'Near the end of the film when Marty is attempting to steal the almanac back from Biff, they approach and eventually drive through a tunnel. This is the same tunnel Private Investigator Eddie Valiant drives through to reach Toon Town in Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988), which was likewise directed by Robert Zemeckis and starred Christopher Lloyd (Doc Brown).', u'One scene from Back to the Future Part III (1990) was filmed during the shooting of this movie. After filming the scene where Doc and Marty return from the future to ""1985A"" and drop Jennifer off on her front porch swing, the cast and crew waited for daylight and filmed the Part III scene where she is awakened.', u""The ending of Doc's departure to 1885 via weather and his ensuing telegram to Marty is foreshadowed. During the beginning, Doc commented how he wished postal delivery was as reliable as the meteorological service."", u'When Doc sees the future newspaper headline change to tell him that he was ""commended"" instead of ""committed"", a headline at the bottom of the page changes from ""Nixon seeks fifth term"" to ""Reagan seeks second term"". (Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan).', u'One initial idea for the sequel had the first two acts the same, but the third act had Biff giving his younger self the almanac in the 1960s, not in 1955. When Marty went back to stop him, he ran into his parents again (who were now hippies) and almost stopped his own conception. Robert Zemeckis decided that it was too similar an idea to the first film, and George and Lorraine would have been too old to be hippies. He came up with the idea of revisiting the original Back to the Future (1985) from different angles with the two Martys in 1955.', u""Biff Tannen's rise to fortune occurred in 1958 (not in 1955), as mentioned during the Biff Museum's video presentation. Biff would have been seventeen going on eighteen years old in 1955. Too young to legally gamble, he had to wait until 1958 (when he was twenty-one years old) to get into the race track to place any bets."", u'The 1990 television special The Secrets of the Back to the Future Trilogy (1990) showed some sequences cut from the film: Biff fades out of 2015 after stumbling out of the DeLorean and behind some trash cans. Marty discovers the destroyed Hill Valley High School.', u""Several elaborate sequences were deleted through various revisions of the script, including: During the 2015 hoverboard chase, Marty grabs on to a flying car that actually pulls him into the sky to a very high altitude. When Marty loses his grip, he is rescued by Doc in a flying van. Marty and Doc, after learning when Biff received the almanac, have to escape in the DeLorean during a police shoot-out. When the car's flying circuits are damaged by gunfire, Doc plunges the time machine straight toward the ground in order to reach eighty-eight miles per hour. While Marty and Doc try to recover the almanac, the fusion generator (and in later revisions, the time circuits) is damaged by Farmer Peabody (a character Marty encountered in the first film) who still thinks the DeLorean is a space ship. With Mr. Fusion and the flight circuits heavily damaged, Marty and Doc fly the DeLorean into an array of power lines over the Grand Canyon to generate enough power to return to 1985."", u'The film depicts an alternate, dystopian 1985 where President Richard Nixon is in his fifth term. This was also a plot point in the Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons graphic novel Watchmen (1986-1987). Alan Moore and Bob Gale have written for Batman comic books.', u'In 2015, when Doc and Marty look at the USA Today newspaper and see the headline change, the following headlines and blurbs are: Across the top: 1. Slamball Playoffs Begin (Slamball would become a televised sport in 2002) 2. Cubs Sweep Series In 5 (a World Series sweep would be in 4 wins thus implying the playoffs have been expanded in the future) 3. Marshall Runs 3min. Mile 4. Washington Prepares For Queen Diana\'s Visit (the film was released 8 years before Princess Diana\'s death) On The Side 1. Man Killed By Falling Litter 2. Tokyo Stocks Are Up 3. Swiss Terrorist Threat 4. Shredding For Charity 5. President Says She\'s Tired 6. Queen Diana... (Repeated Headline) 7. Kelp Prices Increase 8. Pitcher Suspended For Bionic Arm Use 9. Slamball Playoffs (Repeated Headline) 10. Jaws (1975) Without Bite (Movie review of the ""Jaws 19"" gag in the film) Main Headline of Griff and His Gang\'s arrest: ""Gang Jailed"" ""Hoverboard Rampage Destroys Courthouse"" ""Gang Leader: I Was Framed"" Caption below Griff\'s picture: Gang Leader Had Bionic Overload.', u'When the producers knew they were going to make a sequel they tried to get as much of the original cast back together. The only actor who did not agree right away was Crispin Glover, who disputed his salary, and so the character of George McFly was written out (murdered in the alternate future).', u'More time periods are visited in Back to the Future Part II (1989) than in any other Back to the Future movie: The good 1985, 2015, 1985-Alternate, 1955, and 1885. Although the last one was not visited until Back to the Future Part III (1990), the trailer for Part III is shown just before the closing credits, so in a way, it could be considered part of this movie as well. The only time period that isn\'t represented in the movie in any shape or form is the ""original"" 1985, in which Back to the Future (1985) starts.', u'In the alternate timeline, George McFly is murdered on March 15, the Ides of March. This date was made infamous by the assassination of respected Roman leader Gaio Giulio Cesare (Julius Caesar) in 44 B.C.', u""When the DeLorean is struck by lightning at the end, it travels back to January 1, 1885, at 12:00 a.m. (as shown by the malfunctioning time circuits before the jump). At the beginning of the movie, they travel to October 21, 2015, at 4:29 p.m. This means that the total time the DeLorean has passed through during the entire trilogy, counting all the on-screen jumps, is one hundred thirty years, nine months, twenty days, sixteen hours, and twenty-nine minutes. This, however, doesn't include the off-screen jumps Doc Brown made before he returned to 1985 to pick up Marty and Jennifer (he does mention those jumps to Marty, and even shows him a newspaper from a slightly more distant future)."", u""According to the revised six dollar USA Today newspaper article (which formerly featured Marty McFly, Jr. arrested for theft, and now featured Griff Tannen's gang arrested for destruction of the Hill Valley courthouse's window), the real names of Griff's 2015 gang, Data, Spike, and Whitey, are Rafe Unger, Leslie O'Malley, and Chester Nogura."", u'This is the only film in the trilogy that does not end with a time travel vehicle flying directly at the camera.', u'In early scripting, the DeLorean\'s malfunctioning time circuits were due to a police shoot-out\'s or Old Man Peabody\'s having damaged the car from gunfire. These scenes were later rejected, and so the time display\'s flickering was impliedly attributed to merely the amateur ""prototypical"" construction of the time machine (Doc had been the first one to successfully create time travel, after all, and so his initial invention, the somewhat cobbled-together sports-car rig, rather than the subsequently-constructed and more-professionally-designed steam-locomotive machine, would understandably be fairly primitive and experimental, and thus more prone to malfunctions), and to all the stress and battering about that it endured (especially during the periods with the inexperienced Marty, and the clumsy or infirm Biff at the controls) during its life up to that time.', u'The original draft of the script had Doc and Marty travelling to 1967 instead of back to 1955 to stop Biff. Marty once again encounters his mother, and accidentally prevents her from going on vacation with his father, thus stopping his own conception, and endangering his existence once more. Throughout the 1967 scenes, the 1985 Doc is continuously hiding from his 1967 counterpart, but the duo requires the younger version\'s help, since the ""Mr. Fusion"" is broken.', u""In 1985A, the newspaper bearing the story of Doc's mental hospital commitment has a story about Richard Nixon seeking a fifth presidential term. This is believed to have been inspired by the Alan Moore graphic novel Watchmen, in which Richard Nixon is serving a fifth term."", u'On his tombstone, George McFly (who was born on April 1, 1938), is revealed to have the middle name of ""Douglas"".', u'The principal actors committed to the sequels before any scripts were written. Crispin Glover did not return, and Bob Gale came up with the idea to have George be murdered, as a way of writing Crispin Glover out of the script.', u'Biff\'s grandmother, Gertrude, is the mother of Biff\'s father, Irving ""Kid"" Tannen, as seen in Back to the Future: The Game.', u""The Wild Gunman (1984) video game that Marty plays at the Caf\xe9'80s when he talks to the two boys, is a strong foreshadowing of Back of the Future Part III (1990), in which Marty travels back through time to 1885 to rescue Doc, who is trapped in that time period."", u'In this movie, Marty, Doc, and Jennifer travel to October 21, 2015. While there Marty sees a news story showing the Cubs winning the World Series in a sweep against Miami. In 2015, the Chicago Cubs did make their first playoff appearance since 2008 and made it to the NLCS (by defeating the Pittsburgh Pirates and St. Louis Cardinals). However, on October 21, 2015, the Cubs were swept by the New York Mets.']","[u'UK::November 1989 (London Film Festival)', u'USA::20 November 1989 (Century City, California)\n (premiere)', u'USA::22 November 1989', u'Canada::24 November 1989', u'UK::24 November 1989', u'Ireland::24 November 1989', u'Australia::7 December 1989', u'Japan::9 December 1989', u'Brazil::14 December 1989', u'Austria::15 December 1989', u'Belgium::20 December 1989', u'France::20 December 1989', u'Colombia::21 December 1989', u'West Germany::21 December 1989', u'Spain::22 December 1989', u'Finland::22 December 1989', u'Italy::22 December 1989', u'Netherlands::22 December 1989', u'Portugal::22 December 1989', u'Sweden::22 December 1989', u'Denmark::26 December 1989', u'Argentina::28 December 1989', u'South Korea::13 January 1990', u'Turkey::26 January 1990', u'Taiwan::27 January 1990', u'Uruguay::1 February 1990', u'Hong Kong::1 March 1990', u'Hungary::5 April 1990', u'Philippines::26 June 1990 (Davao)', u'Greece::17 December 2002 (DVD premiere)', u'Russia::26 October 2010 (Blu-ray premiere)', u'Japan::28 October 2012 (Harajuku Film Festival)', u'Japan::22 August 2015 (Kawasaki Shinyuri Film Festival)', u'Japan::19 September 2015 (Mito Short Film Festival)', u'Brazil::15 October 2015 (re-release)', u'Chile::21 October 2015 (re-release)', u'Spain::21 October 2015 (re-release) (subtitled version)', u'UK::21 October 2015 (re-release)', u'Mexico::21 October 2015 (re-release)', u'Sweden::21 October 2015 (re-release)', u'Japan::11 March 2016 (Chofu Film Festival)']",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

In total, eighty-two thousand eighty frames of animation were drawn. Including storyboards and concept art. Animation Director Richard Williams estimates that well over one million drawings were done for the movie.', u'Jessica Rabbit was based exactly on four movie femme fatales. Writer Gary K. Wolf had based Jessica primarily on the cartoon character Red, Tex Avery\'s vixen from Red Hot Riding Hood (1943). (In fact, the musical number in Red Hot Riding Hood (1943) is duplicated by Jessica at the Ink and Paint Club.) In addition, Animation Director Richard Williams said he based Jessica mostly on Rita Hayworth in Gilda (1946), Veronica Lake for the peek-a-boo bangs of her hair, and, at the suggestion of Robert Zemeckis, ""the look"" trademark of Lauren Bacall.', u'Judge Doom picks up a record and reads its label: ""The Merry-Go-Round Broke Down"".

Eisner and Silver hated each other from their days at Paramount Pictures in the early 1980s, particularly after the difficulties involved in making 48 Hrs. (1982). Silver shaved off his beard, paid his own expenses, and kept his name out of all initial cast sheets. When Eisner was told, after the movie was complete, who was playing the director, Silver was nearly unrecognizable, he reportedly shrugged and said, ""He was pretty good.""', u'Roger Rabbit is described (design-wise) as having a ""Warners face"", a ""Disney body"", a ""Tex Avery attitude"", Goofy\'s overalls, Mickey Mouse\'s gloves, and Porky Pig\'s bowtie. Richard Williams says he based his Roger color model on the American flag (red overalls, white body, blue tie) so that ""everyone would subliminally like it"".', u'During production, one of the biggest challenges faced by the makers of the film was how to get the cartoon characters to realistically interact with real on-set props. This was ultimately accomplished in two different ways. Certain props (such as Baby Herman\'s cigar or the plates Roger smashes over his head) were moved on-set via motion control machines hooked up to an operator, who would move the objects in exactly the desired manner. Then, in post-production, the character was simply drawn over the machine. The other way of doing it was by using puppeteers. This is most clearly seen in the scene in the ""Ink & Paint Club"". The glasses held by the octopus bartender were in fact being controlled by puppeteers from above, while the trays carried by the penguin waiters were on sticks being controlled from below, the wires and the sticks were simply removed in post-production, and the characters added in.', u'To convince the Disney and Amblin executives that they could make the movie, the filmmakers shot a short test involving Roger bumping into some crates in an alley and then getting picked up by a version of Valiant played by Joe Pantoliano (this test can be seen in the Behind the Ears: The True Story of Roger Rabbit (2003) documentary on the Vista Series DVD). After viewing the test, several of the Disney executives were convinced they had seen a traditional ""man-in-a-suit"" gag with added animation.

Seaman admired Chinatown (1974). There were two sequels planned to that film; the first was The Two Jakes (1990), which was eventually made. The second was to be about corruption in Los Angeles when the streetcar system was undermined, and freeways were built to replace them. It was to be called ""Cloverleaf"". Although it is an animated comedy, Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988) pretty much tells the story that would have been covered in the never-filmed, post-noir sequel.', u'Bob Hoskins had to do a lot of his acting in front of a greenscreen, only visualizing the cartoon characters that were added later. In a 1988 interview for Danish television, he said, ""I had to learn to hallucinate to do it. After doing it for six months, for sixteen hours a day, I lost control of it, and sort of had weasels and rabbits popping out of the wall at me."" Hoskins didn\'t take another job for a year.', u'According to Robert Zemeckis, a major brewing company offered to pay to have their name visible on the liquor bottle, from which Roger drinks, early in the film. Zemeckis reminded them that Roger ""turns into a steam whistle"" after taking a shot, but the brewing company reps didn\'t care, apparently figuring that the publicity they would receive would be priceless. Ultimately, this product placement could not be included, as the film was being distributed by Touchstone Pictures (Disney).', u'Eddie Murphy revealed on Inside the Actors Studio (1994) that he turned down the role of Eddie Valiant. He regrets that decision.', u'Kathleen Turner was nine months pregnant when she recorded the voice of Jessica Rabbit.', u'Screenwriters Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman first adapted the Gary K. Wolf novel, ""Who Censored Roger Rabbit?"", in 1981, with a view to making it with up-and-coming Director Robert Zemeckis. However, when Disney viewed Zemeckis\' two feature films, I Wanna Hold Your Hand (1978) and Used Cars (1980), they felt that he wasn\'t talented enough to pull off the movie. But after he made Romancing the Stone (1984) and Back to the Future (1985), Disney reconsidered, and the movie was green-lit.', u'Judge Doom originally had a vulture on his shoulder, and seven weasels accompanying him, rather like the Seven Dwarfs. He ended up only having five. He was also to have a jury of kangaroos, as in ""Kangaroo Court"". These elements were all dropped, because animating these extra characters would be too costly.', u""Felix the Cat's face appears as the masks of tragedy and comedy on the keystone of the entrance to Toontown."", u'Lena Hyena, the hideously ugly toon whom Eddie mistakes for Jessica Rabbit in Toontown, is based on the creation of the same name by artist Basil Wolverton. She was first conceived in 1946 for a contest by Al Capp to depict ""the world\'s ugliest woman"" to be featured in his ""Lil\' Abner"" comic strip.', u'Judge Doom was originally going to have an animated pet vulture that sat on his shoulder, but that idea was dropped in the interest of saving time. However, the vulture later resurfaced with Judge Doom, when a bendable action figure was produced.', u'During production, there was disagreement over the way the Looney Tunes characters should look. Warner Brothers wanted the filmmakers to use the characters as they appeared in their merchandising at the time, while the producers insisted on having the characters looking the way they had looked at the time period where the film is set, the mid to late 1940s. Dummy footage using the modern designs was sent to Warner Brothers for approval, while the animators used the period-appropriate designs in the actual film.', u'An elaborate funeral scene for Marvin Acme, set at the famous Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, was discarded from the shooting script in pre-production. It came complete with Foghorn Leghorn delivering the eulogy, and the Harvey Toons jack-in-the-box logo springing out of Acme\'s casket to the tune of ""Pop Goes the Weasel"", with a giant funeral wreath attached; also in this scene, were many cartoon cameos that were eventually cut, including Casper the Friendly Ghost (who eventually sends everyone fleeing), Tom & Jerry, Screwy Squirrel, Superman and Lois Lane, Felix the Cat, Chip and Dale, Baby Huey, Mighty Mouse, Crusader Rabbit, Little Lulu, Popeye, Olive Oyl, Bluto, Wimpy, Heckle and Jeckle, Cinderella, Alice, the White Rabbit, the Mad Hatter, the March Hare, Winnie the Pooh, Tigger, Piglet, Peter Pan and Wendy, Herman and Catnip, and Little Audrey amongst others.', u'A brief sequence was prepared to test the techniques used to combine live-action with animation. The footage, which showed Eddie Valiant (played by Joe Pantoliano) walking in an alley with Roger Rabbit, touched on all the challenges expected of the production, shading on the cartoon characters, interaction with the live-action cast members and environment, matching with the constantly moving camera, et cetera. The brief, one-minute film, budgeted at one hundred thousand dollars, convinced the filmmakers that the effects could create the illusion of cartoons and live cast members occupying the same reality.', u'The crowd scenes at the beginning of the Toontown sequence consist mostly of animation from previous Disney films. (Re-using animation was a common practice for Disney up until the early 1990s.)', u'Before he was the official voice of Goofy, Bill Farmer had his first job as a voice over artist singing ensemble for the closing song, ""Smile, Darn Ya, Smile!"". He snuck in the voice of Goofy during this song.', u'A prequel with the working title ""Toon Platoon"" never got out of the developmental stage.', u'In the documentary Behind the Ears: The True Story of Roger Rabbit (2003), Bob Hoskins refers (jokingly) to Charles Fleischer as ""completely nuts"". This is likely due to Fleischer\'s insistence upon wearing a Roger Rabbit suit while voicing the character live on the set, despite reminders that he would never be on-camera himself.', u""Robert Zemeckis wanted to use the Robert Clampett version of Daffy Duck, but Chuck Jones wanted to use his version of the character, and had personally disliked Clampett. Zemeckis had his way, and this was one of the main factors in Jones' stated distaste for the film."", u'To create the animation, over eighty-five thousand hand-inked and painted cels were created and composited with the live-action backdrops, live-action characters, and hand-animated tone mattes (shading), and cast shadows using optical film printers. No computer animation was used in creating the animations. Some scenes involved up to one hundred individual film elements. Any live-action that had to be later composited was shot in VistaVision to take advantage of the double-area frame of the horizontal 35mm format. The finished film thus does not suffer from the increased grain that plagued previous live-action and animation combos, such as Mary Poppins (1964).', u'The photograph that Eddie takes of Marvin Acme and Jessica playing ""patty-cake"" was created during pre-production, and features an earlier design of Jessica, than the one that is used in the final character animation. The one shot that was re-done to incorporate the new Jessica design, was the insert shot of the picture after it is first developed.', u'Wallace Shawn was considered for the role of Eddie Valiant.', u""The film's original budget was projected at fifty million dollars, which Walt Disney Productions felt was too expensive.

This, coupled with the fact that animation could not begin until all of the dialogue was recorded, practically meant finishing the film before it was finished. This also ruled out alternate takes or re-shoots, since the animation for alternate scenes would have been too expensive, and the animation had already been completed for any scenes that the filmmakers might have wanted to film again. As such, cutting even part of a scene for timing, meant that the entire scene had to be taken out, animation and all.', u'A list of the classic cartoon cameos in the film (which is supposed to be set in 1947, though quite a few post-1947 characters appear), grouped by studio: Disney: Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Pluto, Donald Duck, Goofy, Pegleg Pete, Horace Horsecollar, Clarabell Cow, the merry dwarfs from The Merry Dwarfs (1929), the flowers and trees from Flowers and Trees (1932), the Three Little Pigs and the Big Bad Wolf from Three Little Pigs (1933), Peter Pig from The Wise Little Hen (1934), Toby Tortoise, Max Hare, and the girl bunnies from The Tortoise and the Hare (1935), Mickey\'s orphans from Orphan\'s Benefit (1934), Little Red Riding Hood from The Big Bad Wolf (1934), Jenny Wren from Who Killed Cock Robin?

Chuck Jones, in particular, who worked on the film, ended up loathing the final product. He called it an obnoxious, witless misunderstanding of the old cartoons it set out to honor, and he even accused Robert Zemeckis of robbing Richard Williams of any creative input, and for apparently ruining the piano sequence that he and Williams had planned together. Cartoon historian Michael Barrier derided the animation direction as ""disastrous"", and Frank Thomas of Disney\'s Nine Old Men was strongly disappointed in Richard Williams\' failure to have any actual pathos come from the main character himself.

However, Bale became nervous as the stunts began, and didn't do much of anything.

This allows the movie Delorean to reach eighty-eight miles per hour, as judged by that speedometer, although that speedometer shown does not exist on a real Delorean. The original Delorean vehicle can reach eighty-eight miles per hour, but the speedometer tops out at eighty miles per hour, and the needle would be pegged at the limit of the speedometer giving no ability to judge the speed. This is because of a 1979 traffic safety law that insured all speedometers in cars released after September of that year to top out at eighty-five miles per hour, in an effort to encourage drivers to travel at ""safer"" speeds.

They never even mention to Marty who he is named after, acknowledge that such a person was important to their lives and why, and most of all, never notice that the ""two"" Martys look exactly alike. It has been suggested, however, that George at some point figured this out. George\'s novel, ""A Match Made in Space,"" features a young boy and girl on the cover, as well as a mysterious third figure dressed quite like Marty was when playing ""Darth Vader from Planet Vulcan."" This indicates that the story, while fictional, may have been based on Marty\'s attempts to match him and Lorraine. The names Darth Vader and Vulcan almost assuredly caught his eye when they appeared on Star Wars and Star Trek. George has also given Marty the advice that ""If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything,"" something Marty had said to him in 1955. Finally, George has never called out Lorraine on the fact that young Marty looks and is now named for the Marty they met decades ago, something that for many husbands would be proof of adultery.', u'Christopher Lloyd and Lea Thompson appeared in The Right to Remain Silent (1996).', u'Michael J.

Doc Brown comments that old farmer Peabody used to own all of the land, and he grew pines there. When Marty goes back in time, he runs over and knocks down a pine tree on the Peabody\'s property.

The cliffhanger ending of the film was not originally intended to set up a sequel, but rather just as one last joke. It was admitted by the writer that had they originally intended the following two sequels, the ending would not have had Jennifer get into the car with Doc and Marty. This is why Jennifer was almost immediately knocked unconscious at the beginning of Back to the Future Part II (1989).', u'Bob Gale confirmed that for wide shots, the wind during the storm at the Clock Tower was created by using a McBride, which was described by the writer as ""basically an airplane engine on a huge cherry picker"", and was placed a good fifty feet away from the actors. The McBride was so loud, that all of the dialogue said by Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd had to be re-recorded later. However, the McBride also had an effect on Fox\'s health: while filming the sequence where Marty yells up at Doc at the Clock Tower to tell him about the future, he coughed up blood after filming those scenes.', u'In the original script, Marty\'s playing rock and roll at the dance caused a riot, which had to be broken up by police. This, combined with Marty accidentally tipping Doc off to the ""secret ingredient"" that made the time machine work (Coca-Cola) caused history to change. When Marty got back to the 1980s, he found that it was now the 1950s conception of that decade, with air-cars and what-not (all invented by Doc Brown, and running on Coca-Cola). Marty also discovers that rock and roll was never invented, and he dedicates himself to starting the delayed cultural revolution. Meanwhile, his dad digs out the newspaper from the day after the dance, and sees his son in the picture of the riot.', u'The only scene which appears in all three Back to the Future films, is that of Doc sliding down from the clock tower on a cable before the clock is struck by lightning. Stuntman Bob Yerkes, who doubled for Christopher Lloyd during this scene, got extra payment for parts II and III without having to do any work.', u'The dialogue where Lorraine says that when she grows up, she\'ll let her kids do anything they want was cut.

The date is provided by the caption on the photograph that Doc Brown gives Marty at the end of Back to the Future Part III. The time is provided by the Mayor in 1885 in Back to the Future Part III, who starts it. The lightning strikes the clock tower at 10:04 p.m. on November 12, 1955. This means that the clock tower operated for exactly seventy years, two months, seven days, two hours, and four minutes.', u'The ""Mr. Fusion"" energy converter at the end of the film originally had the Westinghouse logo on it. However, the company would not allow the logo to be used, so Art Director Todd Hallowell added some additional lines to the symbol to differentiate it.', u'When Marty meets Doc Brown for the first time in 1955, Doc puts the mind reading device on him and makes three seemingly off the wall assumptions about him. However, when analyzed, they may not be so off the wall after all. He assumes Marty has come from a great distance (and he has, thirty years into the future in fact), wants him to buy a subscription to the Saturday evening post (Marty looks at a newspaper earlier in the day confirming that he was truly in 1955) and that he wants a donation for the Coast Guard (the clock tower lady distributing the flyer asked for a donation and Marty later shows this flyer to Doc when telling him about the 1.21 gigawatts of electricity he needs.) The mind reading device may not have worked how Doc intended it, but it seemed capable of at least grabbing certain thoughts that had been kicking around Marty\'s head, demonstrating Doc\'s prowess as an inventor. This could also be attributed to Doc making general assumptions, about a young kid knocking on his door wearing what others have described as a ""life preserver"" or ""life vest"".', u'The scene in which George McFly (Crispin Glover) finds inner courage and saves his future wife Lorraine Baines (Lea Thompson) from being attacked by Biff Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson) is highly similar to the scene in I Wanna Hold Your Hand (1978) in which the similarly wimpy character Larry Dubois (Marc McClure, who also played Dave McFly in this film) saved Grace Corrigan (Theresa Saldana) from Al (Claude Earl Jones). George and Larry both said, ""Get your goddamn hands off her!"" before punching the attacker. Both this film and I Wanna Hold Your Hand (1978) were directed by Robert Zemeckis and co-written by him and Bob Gale.

While he was filming Dirty Mary Crazy Larry (1974), he insisted on having a one million dollar life insurance policy before he would shoot any scenes involving the helicopter, in which he was due to ride. He was very insistent, and when asked why, Morrow replied ""I have always had a premonition I was going to die in a helicopter crash!""', u'Steven Spielberg ended his friendship with John Landis, as a result of the accident. He said that the crash had ""made me grow up a little more"", and had left everyone who worked on the movie ""sick to the center of our souls"". With regard to how the crash had influenced people\'s attitudes towards safety, he said: ""No movie is worth dying for. I think people are standing up much more now, than ever before, to producers and directors who ask too much. If something isn\'t safe, it\'s the right and responsibility of every actor or crew member to yell, \'Cut!\'""', u'According to John Larroquette, he requested to watch the filming of what would become the tragic helicopter scene, but his car was stolen the night before, and he was unable to get to the set.', u""Known for his meticulous preparation, John Lithgow had worked out certain scenes in his airplane seat in conjunction with the manufactured lightning outside the window. However, during filming, the crew member in charge of the lightning flashes would activate it too soon or too late, throwing off Lithgow's timing.

John Landis opted not to seek a special waiver, either because he did not think he would get permission for such a late hour, or because he knew he would never get approval to have young children as part of a scene with a large number of explosives. The Casting Agents were unaware that the children would be involved in such a dangerous scene. Associate Producer George Folsey, Jr. told the children's parents not to tell any firefighters on-set, that the children were part of the scene, and also hid them from a fire safety officer, who also worked as a welfare worker. A fire safety officer was concerned the blasts would cause a crash, but did not tell Landis of his concerns."", u'At the trial over the helicopter incident, the defense claimed that the explosions were detonated at the wrong time. Randall Robinson, an Assistant Cameraman on board the helicopter, testified that Production Manager Dan Allingham told pilot Dorcey Wingo, ""That\'s too much.

Robinson said that Wingo tried to leave the area, but that ""we lost our control and regained it, and then I could feel something let go, and we began spinning around in circles."" Steve Lydecker, also a Camera Operator on-board, testified that Landis had earlier ""shrugged off"" warnings about the stunt with the comment ""We may lose the helicopter.""

All four parents testified that they were never told that there would be helicopters or explosives on-set, and were reassured that there would be no danger, only noise. Dr. Le, who survived the Vietnam War and immigrated with his wife to the United States, was horrified when the explosions began on the Vietnamese village set, bringing back memories of the war."", u'William Shatner, at one point, was in consideration to reprise his lead role in the Nightmare at 20,000 Feet segment.

This was mainly due to the tragedy that occurred on the ""Time Out"" segment. He finally chose ""Kick the Can"" from the original series.', u'Segment two, ""Kick the Can"", featured Steven Spielberg\'s future mother-in-law, Priscilla Pointer, as Miss Cox.

Although the media seems to have already decided it was completely a Spielberg movie and that Hooper was used as a front man so that Spielberg wouldn't break studio contractual commitments which prevented him from directing another movie while he directed E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982), (which, essentially, is what he did)."", u""Was compared by all the critics to The Amityville Horror (1979), which came out three years earlier in 1979.

The city put out notices for bids to relocate the cemetery and decided to go with the lowest bidder. About a third of the way into the project the contractor realized that he had seriously under bid the job and long story short started moving just the head stones.

The model took several weeks to complete. The shot was arranged with the camera placed directly above model, which was mounted over an industrial strength vacuum generator (the front door was facing directly up, straight at the camera). The model also had about 100 wires attached to various points of the structure. These wires went down through the back of the house, and down through the vacuum collection sack. The camera was turned on, and took 15 seconds to wind up to the required 300 frames per second. The vacuum was turned on, the wires were yanked, and several SFX guys blasted the house with pump-action shotguns. The entire scene was over in about two seconds, and they had to wait until the film was developed before they knew if they would have to do it again. Luckily, they got it right on the first take. The finished scene was sent to Steven Spielberg, who was on location shooting E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982).

After Ray wrote the script, he sought the help of science fiction author Arthur C. Clarke in having the script produce in the United States. Clarke introduced Ray to his friend Mike Wilson, who helped promote the film to Columbia Pictures. Columbia signed on to the project and sought to cast Marlon Brando and Peter Sellers in the lead roles. However, a series of events led to the project being canceled. First, when Ray went to copyright his script, he was surprised to find that the script had already been copyrighted by Wilson as a co-written work, the authors being officially credited as ""Mike Wilson and Satyajit Ray,"" in that order. According to Ray, Wilson\'s only contribution to the script was his suggestion of the word ""broad"" instead of ""chick"" at one place in the script. Later, Brando dropped out of the project and, although an attempt was made to bring James Coburn in his place, Ray said he was disillusioned with Hollywood machinations and returned to Calcutta. The project was abandoned at that time and, although Columbia was interested in reviving the project in the 1970s and 1980s, nothing came of it. When ""E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial"" was released in 1982, many, including Arthur C. Clarke, saw striking similarities in the film to Ray\'s earlier script. Ray said that Steven Spielberg\'s movie ""would not have been possible without my script of \'The Alien\' being available throughout America in mimeographed copies.""

Production Designer Peter Jamison, in selecting the cabin's original site with director Michael Apted, did not consider the site's elevation until shooting began. The elevation's thin air caused major problems for both cast and crew, especially John Belushi in his overweight condition. Belushi had to be constantly revived with oxygen by the medic. The production made the decision to move the cabin site to a 1000 foot lower elevation. The entire cabin, and all the bushes and trees, were moved lock, stock, and barrel to the new site. In town, a duplicate interior cabin had been constructed in a warehouse for interior filming, without the exterior log frame. During this logistic cabin move, Belushi put himself on a diet, realizing his weight prevented him from performing his character at mountain elevations. Watching scenes filmed at the exterior Colorado cabin, you see the weight change on his body frame. With the drop in his weight, moving with the film company to film the Chicago scenes, Belushi actually began to visualize himself as a romantic leading man, and kept at his diet to lose more of his body fat. Filming in Colorado was canceled after early snowfalls, preventing completion of the cabin scenes. The company moved to Chicago earlier than scheduled. Construction foreman-supervisor Doug Vlaming and his crew dismantled the mountain cabin, loading the entire set on flatbed trucks. The set and set dressing returned to Universal City Studios and were reassembled on stage over an enormous scaffold frame duplicating the Colorado terrain's scaled hillside. Universal Studios' green department duplicated every tree, grass and dirt ground cover, shrub, bush, and rock from location reference photos. Linda Spheeris' set decorating crew duplicated the Colorado interior. When the company moved back to Universal Studios, the mountain scenes were the first to resume the daily schedule, including the exterior mountain lion shots. Filming in the controlled stage environment was much easier than filming this scene in the Colorado mountain wilderness. The paint department utilized the floor space beneath the high end of the scaled scaffold mountain hilltop for their paint work area. It was notoriously nicknamed the Pharmacy, because of the drug exchanges which occurred in the area, and also became a favorite hideout for Belushi during his stage work."", u'Penultimate film of actor John Belushi, first released in the same years as Belushi\'s last movie Neighbors (1981).

Braden had been the art director to resume and finish Peter Jamison's Barbra Streisand-Gene Hackman film All Night Long (1981) directed by Jean-Claude Tramont. The film had been interrupted by an actor's strike. Jamison was now working on Continental Divide (1981). He was required to fly to Chicago with the cinematographer who would direct second unit for process plates outside the train at the tracks and platform area in the Chicago train station. Braden consulted with Jamison and both directors, regarding building a duplicate train car exterior and interior compartment and corridors, on stage, for the process plate filming of the train's interior scenes. Braden's resume had included designing-art directing the 1979-80 NBC-TV Supertrain (1979) series which had required extensive process plate filming. Together, discussions between Jamison and Braden included designing the train, designing stage sets to build back at the studio, and locations in Los Angeles. A major penthouse interior set focused their attention because this set required immediate attention related to the film schedule at the studio. Back on the West Coast, plans, elevations and models were prepared and sent to Jamison, in Chicago, for his meetings with director Michael Apted. A dining room featured a mirrored wall at a restaurant the two had dinner in Chicago; this became a focal novel point in the stage set design. When Linda Spheeris returned to the studio to begin dressing the stage sets, arriving a week earlier than Jamison, walking the stage set with Braden, Spheeris commented why the room looks exactly like the Architectural Digest photograph of the Chicago penthouse that Peter copied! Good job! Braden's reaction was why didn't he just tell us to get the issue. They wouldn't of had the design grief putting this set on paper! The set's dining room mirror wall were vertical twelve inch wide, floor to ceiling high, beveled mirrors centered on pivot rods.

Finally, he just decides to repeat whatever Russell said to Warden. Apparently Warden was unaware of what Graham was doing, thus his line ""What\'re you? A fuckin\' parrot?"".

Its production costs would have been too high, so he approached LucasArts in 1989 with the idea of making it a video game instead, being very satisfied with the way Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989) had turned out. Spielberg also contributed to the screenplay by suggesting several puzzles and situations, and helping out with character development.', u'The second version of the game was primarily aimed at adults. Not only was it filled with heavy scientific lingo, it was also made quite violent and gory, as requested by Steven Spielberg. For example, one of the characters would turn into a bloody corpse after entering a cave filled with acid, another was to be ferociously attacked by bats, and there was to be an amputation scene featuring lots of blood, requiring a tourniquet. However, after receiving much criticism for some particularly violent and bloody scenes in his movie Jurassic Park (1993), Spielberg asked the design team to tone down the mood of the game, so that it would still be appropriate for children.', u""The first version that was inspired by Steven Spielberg's original idea was vastly different than the final result. It would have been situated in the future and feature a distant planet with ruins of four major cities, but no sophisticated aliens inhabiting them. The main characters were humans inspecting the planet. They would gradually find out that one of the cities waged war on the peaceful other three, making the planet so toxic that all survivors of each civilization were forced to go into stasis, to be revived when the planet became habitable again. The main characters would eventually revive all civilizations, and establish peace on the planet by converting the war-mongering tribe to a peaceful way of life."", u'During its production, The Dig went through three significantly different versions of the plot and four changes of project leaders.', u'Before entering the door to the first tram platform, Boston Low jokes that there may be a mad scientist with a pretty girl and a talking robot on the other side. This is a reference to the classic science fiction movie Forbidden Planet (1956), which is also about a couple of astronauts arriving on a planet full of technology from a society that has long since died out (and where they indeed find a deranged professor and his pretty daughter). Forbidden Planet was one of the main inspirations for the game.', u'Steven Spielberg envisioned the game originally as a hybrid between Forbidden Planet (1956) (a planet full of alien technology from a long-since disappeared civilization) and The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948) (people unable to trust one another because of growing greed and paranoia).', u'Several pieces of artwork for the game showed four astronauts instead of three, originating from the second version of the game which had four main characters. The fourth character was a Japanese business man who co-funded the mission and therefore became part of the crew. He was eventually written out of the game, and all artwork produced thereafter showed three astronauts.', u""During the first brainstorm session for the game at LucasArts, a large earthquake hit the Los Angeles area. Many have jokingly described the earthquake as a bad omen of the so-called 'Dig curse': the production of the game was indeed plagued by creative problems, re-writes, changes in management, and the final product was not released until many years after its first conception (although to generally favorable reviews)."", u'As specified in the game\'s manual, the name of the alien planet is Cocytus. The planet is never named as such within the game; the characters only ever refer to it as ""this place"" or ""alien planet"". Originally, Brink was to come up with the nickname, but this piece of dialogue was scrapped.', u""Originally, the gameplay included much more survival elements, requiring the player to look for food and water to stay alive. When Sean Clark took over, he removed these elements because they would only frustrate the player. He also simplified the interface, moving away from the traditional 'verb interface' that LucasArts had used for years, where the player performs actions by combining verb commands with objects."", u'In an early version of the game, Boston Low and Judith (not Maggie) Robbins both had blond hair. There was also an object called the Klein bottle, which would mirror the appearance of a character (i.e. making them left-handed instead of right-handed). This would be needed to solve several puzzles.', u'The second version of the story was largely similar to the final version. The major differences were that a fourth main character was added, a Japanese business man who had funded the space flight, and therefore demanded to be part of its crew; the aliens had also found a space dimension in which they could live forever, but they were quite happy there, as opposed to in the final version. Their intention was to gather several space faring species to their planet, and make the surrounding particularly hostile, so that only the most clever individuals would find out how to enter the dimension, and therefore be worthy of it.', u""The planet was named Cocytus by the game's creators. In Greek mythology, Cocytus is one of the five rivers that run around the Underworld, the place where dead souls end up after death. The rivers (the Styx being the most famous) separate the Underworld from the world of the living, and need to be crossed to gain access to the afterlife. Cocytus literally means 'Lamentation', and is considered the river of wailing. The name seems fitting, since the Cocytans in the game used their planet to cross into some form of afterlife, where they can only exist as non-corporeal beings, a move they now regret."", u""Early in the game, Ludger Brink objects when Boston Low digs up a grave, where he retrieves a jawbone. Ironically, that same bone is later used to save Brink's life by cutting off his hand that got trapped between rocks.""]",,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Most of the people associated with the production say it was a collaborative effort, with Hooper having equal say and input in terms of story development and shot setup, (it was Hooper's idea to do a ghost story in the first place, not Spielberg's); while Spielberg definitely had the upper hand and the final say in terms of editing. Although the media seems to have already decided it was completely a Spielberg movie and that Hooper was used as a front man so that Spielberg wouldn't break studio contractual commitments which prevented him from directing another movie while he directed E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982), (which, essentially, is what he did)."", u""Was compared by all the critics to The Amityville Horror (1979), which came out three years earlier in 1979. The consensus was this was slightly better; with more solid storytelling, better special effects, and without Rod Steiger's hamfisted performance. And although both movies were big box office hits and started mini-franchises of their own, neither was considered a classic. To find a classic in the haunted house genre, most critics would point to either Stanley Kubrick's The Shining (1980), or Robert Wise's The Haunting (1963)."", u'At a point of the movie, Dr. Lesh talks with Diane and Robbie about a white light that people see when they are dying. As well as it describes may derive from war stories that pilots claim to have seen in combat, the Dr. Lesh\'s explanations about the light and the effects of the people who see it are inspired in the book ""Life After Life"", written by Dr. Raymond Moody and published in 1975. It\'s a series of compilations and testimonies about people who by a brief time were dead and later lived again, called NDE or Near-Death Experience.

In the late 1800's when Denver was expanding, there was a graveyard where the city government wanted to put in a grand city park like the one that New York city built and that city's across the country sought to emulate; Central Park. The city put out notices for bids to relocate the cemetery and decided to go with the lowest bidder. About a third of the way into the project the contractor realized that he had seriously under bid the job and long story short started moving just the head stones. He completed the job and the city started building the slated structure, an were actually getting close to finishing, when one of the contractors employees spilled the beans. The contractor was arrested but the damage was done. The city, not being able to afford to tear down the building and redig up the cemetery, left it as it was and just finished the project, leaving the unmarked graves as they were.

The model took several weeks to complete. The shot was arranged with the camera placed directly above model, which was mounted over an industrial strength vacuum generator (the front door was facing directly up, straight at the camera). The model also had about 100 wires attached to various points of the structure. These wires went down through the back of the house, and down through the vacuum collection sack. The camera was turned on, and took 15 seconds to wind up to the required 300 frames per second. The vacuum was turned on, the wires were yanked, and several SFX guys blasted the house with pump-action shotguns. The entire scene was over in about two seconds, and they had to wait until the film was developed before they knew if they would have to do it again. Luckily, they got it right on the first take. The finished scene was sent to Steven Spielberg, who was on location shooting E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982). He gave it to a projectionist, who assumed it was dailies from ET and was startled by the images. Spielberg had the remains of the model encased in perspex, and it is now sitting on his piano.

In Poltergeist II: The Other Side (1986), it's revealed that under the Freelings' home there is a mass grave of a sect of the 19th century, who buried themselves in the belief that the end of the world had come.

Pacino wasn\'t interested, and Nicholson thought that any actor would be overwhelmed by the special effects. Hackman turned down the role because he was in a troubled marriage and could not spend 16 weeks outside of Los Angeles on location-shooting. The studio suggested James Caan, but his agent wanted $1 million plus 10% of the gross.

A live action shot which would later have a special effect added would also be shot in 70mm. The rest of the film was shot in 35mm. When the 70mm special effects shot was overlaid on the 70mm live action, the overall graininess was the same as normal, non-effect 35mm film, thus matching the rest of the film, even after the completed film was blown up to 70mm prints. This was to avoid the effect Steven Spielberg had noticed in previous effects-laden films, where the viewer instinctively knew when a special effect was coming up, because of the change in the grain of the shot.', u'After a while, Fran\xe7ois Truffaut found the long shoot tiring and he was frustrated over not being able to get on with his own directing work.

Still, the experience gave him good insight into what it takes to act in film. All in all, Truffaut respected Steven Spielberg for his outward calm, patience and good humour and found that despite his own relative lack of experience in front of the camera (having acted only twice in his own movies), ""several times during the shooting [Spielberg] made me...come out of myself. Thanks to that, I discovered a real pleasure as an actor.""

Eight people operated the mechanisms to control the puppet, and Steven Spielberg was so pleased with it, according to Rambaldi, he often played with it.

He found the director more commanding and less eager to discuss options than previously, but Zsigmond was enthusiastic to be on the picture. ""[Close Encounters] had the smell of a great movie. We fell into sandtraps not because anybody made mistakes but because we were making things that had never been done before."" Zsigmond found himself blamed for many of those ""sandtraps"" by producer Julia Phillips and the studio, who almost fired him over his insistence that he needed at least one day to pre-light the enormous set. Nevertheless, Zsigmond refused to give in to pressure to use less lighting, and he was supported in this by Spielberg and especially Trumbull, who knew what it would take to match the scenes to the special effects. After the first two months of shooting in Mobile, when studio executives and financial backers began to show up on set, Phillips insisted on firing him. Several other cinematographers were called as potential replacements--John A.

That is why Roy Neary was trying to convince his family to see that film together just before the blackout. The song remains incorporated in the John Williams score, though. A toy can also be heard playing the song\'s melody right before Roy rips off the top off his sculpture.', u'The actors had to spend a lot of time acting to objects and things that weren\'t there and being told by Steven Spielberg what they were looking at and how to react. ""For weeks we were just sitting on a rock, shifting positions, pretending to look at the landing site and the sky,"" Melinda Dillon said. ""It was a great acting exercise."" Fran\xe7ois Truffaut, however, found it very difficult, finally giving himself over to be nothing more than another object in the ""grand cartoon strip"" of 2,000 storyboard sketches Spielberg had shown him. When Richard Dreyfuss saw the final picture, he was upset with several moments of his performance, believing he would have reacted quite differently if he had seen the actual effects.', u""Richard Dreyfuss's father was an extra in the film and spent six months on location; however, the scenes in which he appeared never made the final cut."", u'From a budget of $20 million (sizeable at the time), this went on to become one of the top grossing films of the 1970s.', u'A highly detailed miniature and the filming technique ""forced perspective"" were used to create the effect of an ocean freighter left stranded in the Gobi desert.', u'The film holds the record for most cinematographers on a production (11, counting the Special Edition).', u'Famed ufologist J. Allen Hynek - who coined the phrase ""close encounter of the third kind"" - actually has a cameo in this movie. He can be seen as the gray-haired man with glasses, a pointed beard, and a pipe walking out to see the returnees in the final sequence.', u'Steven Spielberg was intimidated by the prospect of asking one of his cinematic heroes, Fran\xe7ois Truffaut, to play the part of Lacombe. Truffaut liked Spielberg\'s work and agreed but told him, ""I am not an actor; I can only play myself."" Spielberg replied that was exactly what he wanted, and Truffaut signed on for $75,000.', u'The character of Claude Lacombe (Fran\xe7ois Truffaut) is based on real-life French UFO expert Jacques Vall\xe9e.', u'The darkening sky and the shape of the clouds forming in the scene before Jilian\'s son gets abducted by the aliens resembles that of the ""Angel of Death"" in The Ten Commandments (1956) that comes into the sky before the slaying of all the firstborn of Egypt begins. Also, Roy and his family are watching this movie on TV before he is called to work after the power failure.', u""The nine foot diameter model of the mothership that was used in the final sequences was kept locked up in Steven Spielberg's garage to help prevent pictures of it from appearing in the media before the release of the film."", u'Steven Spielberg cast Teri Garr in the film after seeing her work on a coffee commercial. He was impressed that she was able to convey a wide range of emotions in just a 30-second clip.', u""When the lights go out in the Neary house during the blackout, the miniature lakes on Roy's model train layout continue to glow in the dark.

They settled on an abandoned hangar near Mobile, Alabama where they thought they\'d have greater control over the enormous $700,000 set. Bigger than a football field and six times the size of the largest Hollywood sound stage, the hangar harbored its own climate, trapping humidity that sometimes caused clouds and precipitation during filming. Dozens of very large lights were needed, and the 200 extras involved necessitated careful choreography of movement. All of this meant frequent delays and rising costs. The scenes filmed on this set accounted for only about a fifth of the film\'s running time but took up easily half of the shooting schedule. Spielberg stated, ""That set became our shark on this picture.""', u'The entire landing strip complex behind Devils Tower was actually constructed and filmed in an abandoned aircraft hangar at the former Brookley AFB in Mobile, Alabama.', u""Gillian's phone number, seen when she tries to dial for help when the aliens come for Barry, is 311-555-2368. This number frequently appeared on phones in Bell Telephone print ads around the late 1960s.

Jack Nicholson was also considered. McQueen turned the role down because he said he wasn't able to cry on film."", u""One of the reasons behind new cost increases was Steven Spielberg's decision to release the film in 70mm using a process that allowed for a wider magnetic sound track to let him create greater audio impact as well as visual."", u'Although Steven Spielberg continued to support Vilmos Zsigmond, creating what the cinematographer called ""a very rewarding"" experience, Zsigmond was not asked to shoot additional sequences and shots that were needed after the company left Alabama. He believed this was largely the work of Julia Phillips and the studio. Although Zsigmond shot about 90 percent of the picture, additional material (the India sequence, the discovery of the lost Air Force squadron, etc.) was shot by others, primarily William A. Fraker, as well as Douglas Slocombe, John A. Alonzo, and L\xe1szl\xf3 Kov\xe1cs, all of whom received on-screen credit as additional directors of photography, a vindictive move by Phillips, by her own admission.', u'Despite the title ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind,"" Barry and the other abductees were actually involved in a case of ""Close Encounters of the Fourth Kind,"" which denotes abduction by extraterrestrial beings. However, among other problems, the phrase ""Close Encounters of the Fourth Kind"" had not been invented yet, and was unnecessary for Steven Spielberg\'s use.', u'Several scenes were filmed around Mobile, AL, and many locals were cast. This is why several characters in the film have accents uncharacteristic of those from Indiana and Wyoming.', u'This is essentially an adult rethink of ""Firelight,"" a movie that Steven Spielberg made as an adolescent. He even gave Douglas Trumbull and Vilmos Zsigmond notes that he\'d made at that time, for their work on ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind.""', u'The underside of the mothership was inspired by the lights of the San Fernando Valley at night.', u'A digital system called the Electronic Motion Control System was employed to record and program camera movements so they could be duplicated in post-production when putting live-action photography together with the matching miniature effects.', u'Julia Phillips, who by this time had developed a serious cocaine problem and was divorced from producer Michael Philips, was forced off the picture by Columbia during post-production in 1977.', u""Melinda Dillon was suffering from a sprained ankle when location shooting began in May 1976 at Devil's Tower.

As written, Jillian was to have remained in her house, shut off from the outside world. During production, however, Steven Spielberg decided it was better to show that Jillian had travelled out west searching for her missing son, and so the set of a New Mexico-style motel room was hastily built to film the scene."", u""Two of the old AMT Star Trek (1966) model kits - the USS Enterprise and the Klingon Battle Cruiser (both painted silver) - can be seen hanging over Roy's model railroad layout, on which he fashions his clay model of Devil's Tower."", u""Cary Guffey's performance was so outstanding, that his name was mentioned as a possible nominee for Best Supporting Actor, during the nominations process for the Academy Awards, in 1977.

He would come to find Close Encounters to be ""twice as bad, and twice as expensive, as well.""', u'Douglas Trumbull and Steven Spielberg went through several conceptions of what the UFOs would look like. One abandoned idea was to have them resemble structures and logos familiar on Earth, such as those for McDonalds and Chevron, to suggest the aliens were using human symbols to make their crafts appear less threatening.', u'During a fierce summer storm, the side of the hangar blew off. Luckily no one was hurt, but the accident caused further delays while it was repaired. Richard Dreyfuss later said, ""Part of the shoot was a nightmare. It went from fun to frightening.""', u'Steven Spielberg first considered doing a documentary or a low-budget feature film about people who believed in UFOs.', u'Steven Spielberg and other producers wanted Walter Cronkite as newsreader for the broadcast that Neary ignores in the living room sculpture scene. However, CBS would not allow Cronkite to take the role, so producers settled on ABC\'s Howard K. Smith. Unfortunately, the news cutaway scene to Wyoming reporter was filmed before this decision; as a result, the reporter says ""order your steak well done, Walter."" In addition, during the interrogation of Neary by Lacombe, Neary shouts ""you think I investigate every Walter Cronkite story there is?""', u'Because the complicated and extensive visual effects were stretching the limits of what had been done before, Steven Spielberg also discovered a difficult new challenge in having to shoot scenes without an exact idea of how they would look when Douglas Trumbull completed them and added them to the film in post-production, months after principal photography was finished. On Jaws, the effects were difficult, but they were mechanical and physical, right there before him every day. The unknown of working around optical effects to be added later meant a more tense on-set atmosphere. Trumbull said, ""I\'ll never be able to thank him enough for having the confidence and the patience to see it through time and not panic. There was enormous pressure on the production all the time from the studio to keep moving on.""', u'During the scene in which the power goes out at a McDonald\'s restaurant, the song ""More Than a Feeling"" by Boston can be heard coming from a car radio. This song appeared on the band\'s self-titled debut album in 1976 which, coincidentally, featured a huge saucer-shaped spaceship on the cover.', u""To get the spaceships' attention prior to their arrival at Devils Tower, the five notes the scientists play are G, A, F, (octave lower) F, C.

He finally suggested Devil's Tower in Wyoming, which closely resembled prominent features of Monument Valley, where John Ford shot movies like The Searchers (1956). Devil's Tower was preferable because it was less familiar to movie audiences and a more solitary and abrupt intrusion on the landscape. These features made the sheer, jagged-edge rock rising nearly 1,300 feet from the surrounding terrain eerie and imposing."", u'John Williams wanted the music to ""convey a sense of awe and fascination"" as well as ""overwhelming happiness and excitement"" at the prospect of seeing aliens for the first time.', u'When principal photography began again on May 16, 1976, the budget had risen in stages to $11 million, and kept climbing as Steven Spielberg expanded his ideas.', u""In the beginning of the film in the Sonoran Desert, from inside one of the World War II airplanes, they pull out a calendar that looks vintage from 1945. Across the grid of the days of a full month on the calendar is plainly seen a light blue logo from the defunct Security National Bank (which did not exist in 1945, either). In the fall of 1972, Security National Bank issued a 1973 calendar that corresponded exactly, month by month, day by day, to the 1945 calendar for fun. Thus, this unique idea was a promotional give away to the bank's customers. The props crew probably could not locate an authentic 1945 calendar, so instead they utilized the fake vintage calendar, which was not hard to find in 1976."", u""Production designer Joe Alves chose an old farmhouse located outside Fairhope, Alabama, for the Guiler home, feeling it had a lonely quality suited to Jillian's character as a free spirit."", u'During the very beginning of the ""space show"" at the end of the film, the various dots (ships) doing their tricks in the sky form the ""Big Dipper."" This takes place just before Roy and Gillian laugh as they watch the objects in the sky.', u'When the project was first pitched to Columbia in 1973, Steven Spielberg said it would cost $2.7 million to make. Due to delays caused by script development problems, he went on to make Jaws (1975), a huge success that gave him more status and bargaining power with the studio. At that point, exhausted and frazzled from the difficult location work on the shark movie, Spielberg decided he wanted to make Close Encounters entirely in the studio, and the budget was set at $4.1 million. As time went on and production ideas and plans grew more elaborate, it became clear more money would be needed, a prospect not looked on favourably by the financially strapped studio. Douglas Trumbull was surprised by the original low budget because he had estimated early on that his effects alone would cost about $3 million. The final figure for effects was fairly close to that.', u'Special effects were a part of more than 200 different shots in the movie, and some of them contained as many as 18 separate visual elements, including dozens of matte paintings and animated sequences. With no knowledge of such techniques, Steven Spielberg depended heavily on Douglas Trumbull. ""If Trumbull hadn\'t accepted the job,"" Spielberg said in a 1978 article, ""I\'d still be on the Columbia back lot trying to get a cloud to materialize from thin air.""', u'Jean Renoir compared the film to Jules Verne and Georges M\xe9li\xe8s.', u""When the aliens visit Jillian's home, there's a shot of the screws in the floor vent unscrewing. This is shown in an extreme close-up. The unscrewing effect is very similar to what we see in the movie version of The War of the Worlds (1953), which would later be remade by Spielberg himself."", u'The huge success of the film made a popular icon of its signature logo, a black-and-white image of a highway receding towards a glowing horizon at night. In 1978, an enterprising group of students from the College of Architecture at Ball State University in Muncie, IN, manufactured and sold a small production run of black T-shirts emulating the logo and typeface of the original, but reading ""MUNCIE INDIANA: A Gross Encounter of the Worst Kind.""

However, artists were given very little visual references to work with, and were unable to obtain likeness rights for the movie's cast members."", u'In a conversation with Bob Balaban, Fran\xe7ois Truffaut, talking of his directorial career, said he had to choose his projects carefully, since he felt he only had about thirty more years in which to make films. Tragically he lived only another eight years after filming Close Encounters of the Third Kind.', u'While no part of the film was actually shot in Muncie, Indiana, a production team did visit for local details and props, such as the pull-down map of Muncie that Roy consults in his truck. They also visited the bookstore of Ball State University for university memorabilia, such as a fraternity ""BSU"" paddle visible on Roy\'s wall, and the red-and-white ""BallU"" (or U-Ball) T-shirt worn by Roy in the shaving-cream scene.', u'Melinda Dillon was cast largely at the suggestion of director Hal Ashby. He had heard that Steven Spielberg was having difficulty casting the part of Jillian, and Ashby had just completed his movie Bound for Glory (1976) with her in the cast - and liked her work. So Ashby sent Spielberg a couple of film reels containing her acting.

To prevent anyone not directly involved with the production from sneaking onto the set, everyone working on the film was required to wear an ID badge, and on one occasion Spielberg himself was barred from entry when he showed up without his.', u'Six ""wrap parties"" were held before the film completed its production, since Steven Spielberg was continually revising his vision of the film.', u'The organization that Claude Lacombe (Fran\xe7ois Truffaut) leads is called the ""Mayflower Project.""

During the scene, Lacombe tested Laughlin's skills as an interpreter by having him translate part of an erotic book.

Spielberg then whispered to the gorilla to remove his mask, eliciting a smile from Guffey."", u'The small aliens in the film were played by local girls aged between 8 and 12 years old. Girls were used instead of boys because Steven Spielberg felt that they moved more gracefully.', u'Fran\xe7ois Truffaut was continually trying to improve his English during production, and he was self-conscious of his heavy French accent. When he delivered the line ""They belong here more than we"" (after he learns the Army plans to dust the mountain with nerve gas), several crew members thought that he had said ""Zey belong here, Mozambique."" Several T-shirts were printed with this quote as a joke. When he heard about this, Truffaut supposedly burst out laughing. Steven Spielberg mentioned on a laserdisc documentary for E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982) that Truffaut later used a variation of the line in a congratulatory telegram after E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982) was screened at the Cannes Film Festival.

Steven Spielberg told him to think of all his friends going away forever.', u'The final alien with whom Mr. Lacombe communicates by sign language was initially a child in a rubber costume. However, when doing the hand gestures, the folding rubber simply looked fake, so the scene had to be re-shot with an animatronic puppet.', u""The mothership's dome was supposedly meant to resemble a breast, with the hatch lowering from it meant to be its nipple, as a very literal representation of a 'mother-ship'."", u'Many techniques were attempted to portray the aliens, who were played by little kids in rubber suits. One involved shooting them at normal speed while they moved through a sea of mimes dressed as technicians. The mimes would make slow motion movements so that when the film was sped up, the mimes looked normal and the aliens would appear to run about with super-human quickness. Flailing their arms and long hands about, they would somewhat resemble bugs. Inventive as it was, the human movements did not look convincing, so the idea was abandoned. Another idea was to suspend the aliens on wires and have them fly, since the mothership was supposedly in a lower gravity field (this line remains in the final cut of the movie as the ship lands: ""watch for dizziness and low gravity""), and Neary was even supposed to float up as he walked into the ship at the end. This idea was eventually cut too, as this meant there would be a huge number of wires that could not be concealed by lighting, so wires were only used on the very thin insectoid alien.', u""Dr. J. Allen Hynek (who created the 'close encounters' and other UFO report classification schemes) makes a cameo appearance near the end of the film during the return of abductees just after one of the infamous Flight 19's pilots is announced as having returned.

This was the second time that Spielberg used an author as a cameo appearance in a movie; Peter Benchley had a cameo in Jaws (1975)."", u'Steven Spielberg gave Carlo Rambaldi photos of Cary Guffey to use as reference when creating the animatronic extraterrestrial (nicknamed ""Puck"") that communicates with Lacombe. The resemblance is most noticeable when the alien smiles.', u'The final sequence as well as almost every scene that takes place at night was filmed at a giant airplane hangar (not a dirigible hangar as is often stated) in Mobile, Alabama. The heat was unbearable, although it did not actually rain in the hangar as is often erroneously reported - the crew was only told that such a condition was possible because of the great humidity. There was a constant effort to get every arc light available to the location to film the reflections of the UFOs. Many lights in retirement from the Technicolor era were brought out of mothballs for the spaceship sequences.', u'During the end sequence when Roy is about to board the mothership, you can distinctly hear a stylized, yet very recognizable rendition of ""When You Wish Upon a Star"" playing in the score.', u""Beyond having to manage the myriad of complex technical and artistic details involved, Steven Spielberg would find he also had to spend a lot of time and energy battling the studio for more and more money, a task he wasn't prepared for and didn't like. At one point later in production, the studio refused to shell out several thousand dollars for the effect of the Devil's Tower control room glass shattering and Spielberg used his own money for it."", u'As the returned abductees emerge from the belly of the ""Mothership"", their names are read out over a PA system. One of the names is Ken Swenson, who in reality was one of the model-makers working on this film.', u""The spindly alien which appears briefly, spreading it's arms in a peaceful gesture, was an elaborate marionette made for the film by puppeteer Bob Baker, and referred to during the production as 'Daddy Long Legs.' Actually the prototype for a planned sequence involving several aliens performed as marionettes, Baker's alien had transparent skin so that the internal organs and skeleton were visible, including a beating heart. Although the idea of using marionettes was abandoned, a last minute decision was made to include Baker's prototype, and so a miniature set of the mothership ramp was constructed to film the creature emerging from the ship."", u""When the mothership opened, strings of white cubes were originally supposed to come out of it, quickly flying through the area like little sensors probing the surroundings. A test was done and some footage shot with the effect, but the special effects crew thought their techniques weren't advanced enough, so the idea was scrapped."", u'When Lacombe plays the 5 notes on the keyboard, in the scene when the number transmissions are revealed to be Earth coordinates, watch closely in the background for the iconic poster of Farah Fawcett (then Farah Fawcett-Majors).', u'The mothership interior sequence from the 1980 Special Edition was designed by artist Ron Cobb, who also designed the Nazi flying wing for Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981). At the time, Cobb was being considered to direct another Steven Spielberg project known as ""Night Skies"", a proposed followup to Close Encounters of the Third Kind that was ultimately scrapped when Spielberg decided to make E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982) instead.', u""Makeup man Bob Westmoreland appears twice in the film, first as one of Roy's co-workers at the DWP (only in the original 1977 theatrical cut), and later as one of the missing Flight 19 pilots returned by the mother ship."", u'Altough Warren J. Kemmerling\'s character is credited as Wild Bill, Lacombe calls him ""Major Walsh"" all times. It reveals his full name as William ""Bill"" Walsh.', u'When shown on TCM they will play one of the three editions according to what time slot they use for the showing but do not say which version they will show.

He was assigned to Blessed Sacrament in Birmingham, AL prior to coming to Mobile.', u""When Roy tries to explain to his son Brad what are mathematical fractions, he uses his model trains to put partially a lonely wagon in a crossroad, turning on another train to cause an accident if Brad doesn't find the right answer to move enough the wagon from the crossroad. As Brad doesn't speaks, the train crashes against the wagon. This foreshadows the lately train accident that the US Amy pretends to remove all people close to Devil's Tower surroundings, in order for having not witness of the encounter with UFOs."", u'After that Roy Neary (Richard Dreyfuss) and Jillian Guiler (Melinda Dillon) meet by second time during a reunion of people who hopes to contact UFOs, when she watches two lights moving in the night sky she comments: ""It\'s like Halloween for grownups"". In the Spanish dubbed over voice it was change for ""Es como una Noche de San Juan a lo bestia"" (It\'s like Bonfires of Saint John\'s night to the wild), since then Halloween was unknown in Spain at those time.

Since there were no road lights at the intersection where they filmed, the art director built a tractor rental station on one side of the road and strung 200 50-watt light bulbs over it.

Not having faith in the picture, however, it switched to a wider opening, a sign at the time that it was just trying to burn the film off quickly.

Admiration, for having sought new viewpoints and a fresh approach to the mise-en-scene, giving the film his own unmistakable touch. Vanilla Sky is as true the original spirit as it is irreverent towards its form, and that makes it a courageous, innovative work. I think I can say that, for me, the projects are like two very special brothers. They have the same concerns, but their personalities are quite different. In other words, they sing the same song but with quite different voices: one likes opera, and the other likes rock and roll.""', u'The scene with Tom Cruise alone in Times Square is not computer enhanced. The production was given unprecedented permission to shut down Times Square for one Sunday. At the time, the news ticker was providing updates on the George W. Bush-Al Gore election. To avoid dating the film, Crowe got permission to change the NASDAQ sign in post-production.', u'In the opening of the film where Tom Cruise gets out of his car and runs in Times Square, you can see an episode of The Twilight Zone, The Twilight Zone: Shadow Play (1961) being shown on the large screen.

Crowe didn't remove them, and they appear in several shots of New York City."", u'Sofia\'s line, ""I\'ll tell you in another life, when we are both cats"" was a phrase actually uttered spontaneously in a moment of frustration by Pen\xe9lope Cruz to Cameron Crowe.', u'At the start of the movie, when David wakes up with Julie Gianni, her cell phone ringtone is ""Row, Row, Row Your Boat"" but at the moment she answers the call and the music stops, the next lyric would have been ""Life is but a dream"".', u'The album ""The Freewheelin\' Bob Dylan"" can be seen in David\'s bedroom. Later he and Sofia recreate the image, as pointed out during the end montage.', u""The flat-screen television that retracts into the floor was thought up by Cameron Crowe and Tom Cruise while brainstorming things they've always dreamed of having, that the David Aames character should have.

Both groups have control over part of David\'s life.', u'Jared Leto auditioned for the role that eventually went to Jason Lee.', u'Cameron Diaz was referred to as ""CD"" during production, to avoid confusing her with Cameron Crowe.', u'Cameron Crowe summed up the movie in the production notes with the following words: ""Snowboarding through life, David Aames appears to lead a charmed life. Handsome, wealthy and charismatic, the young New York City publishing executive\'s freewheeling existence is enchanting, yet he seems to be missing something. Like the pointillism of an Impressionist landscape, a life can appear to be entirely different when examined close up. In one night David meets a girl of his dreams and loses her by making a small mistake. Thrust unexpectedly onto a roller-coaster ride of romance, comedy, suspicion, love, sex and dreams, David finds himself on a mind-bending search for his soul and discovers the precious, ephemeral nature of true love.""', u'To Kill a Mockingbird (1962) plays in the holding block, on the television screen in the security room, in almost all of the scenes between David and Dr. McCabe. It\'s one of Cameron Crowe\'s favorite movies, and it\'s later revealed that David based his ""ideal father figure"" on Gregory Peck\'s Atticus Finch.', u'Cameron Crowe says, ""The original film is like a song our band really liked and we decided to cover it our own way. I view my adaptation as a \'remix\' rather than a \'remake\'; the film is a genre-bending, mind-twisting portrait of the American male as he exists five minutes into the future. Hopefully, it honors the original. I like the idea it could be sort of a dialogue between the two movies. I kept thinking of the original like a folk song. There\'s so many different ways you can play it, and you can reinvent it in your own way. I would never say to somebody, \'Don\'t see his, see ours.\' I want people to see both.""', u'Kate Hudson turned down the role of Julie Gianni, while Maggie Gyllenhaal also auditioned.', u'Writer/director Cameron Crowe also referred to the clues as his version of the \'Paul is Dead\' rumor (the notorious Beatles hoax from the late-60s, when fans became convinced through song lyrics, sonic tricks, and album art that Paul McCartney had died and was replaced by a look-alike). ""Divorcing it from whether Paul was really dead or not, that was a really great parlor game: searching for clues, the excitement of different layers, some of them chilling, some of them really funny. It was a great model for us.""', u'In the very beginning of the film, a whispering voice is heard: ""Abre los ojos"" (Spanish for ""Open your eyes"".) Vanilla Sky is a remake of a Spanish film titled Open Your Eyes (1997).', u""There are multiple occasions when the number (or time) 9:09 is displayed prominently. (David's watch, the chalkboard, a kid wearing a blue shirt that says #9 and of course all the mentions of cats (who according to various myths, have nine lives). Crowe has stated in multiple interviews that this is an homage to the Beatles and their song Revolution #9."", u'The screenplay was sent to studios with the following quote from the character David Aames on the titles page, ""The little things. There\'s nothing bigger, is there?""', u'\'I Fall Apart\' by Julianna Gianni (Cameron Diaz) features music and lyrics by Cameron Crowe and his wife Nancy Wilson. Here\'s Cameron Diaz\'s comments: ""Well, that was Cameron\'s request that I sing it. It was a huge fear to conquer ... standing in that booth in front of Nancy Wilson, who has been my goddess since I was a child. My sister and I would just sit with their Heart albums and just be like, \'These beautiful creatures making rock \'n\' roll, are you kidding me?\' So, when Cameron said Nancy wrote a song, I was like, \'I couldn\'t!\' I had chills. I was so excited to sit in front of her and she just sat there and sang and strummed a guitar and I was just like, \'I can\'t believe this is happening.\' And then to actually go into the studio and record with her ... she had to lay down her own voice underneath mine to help carry the song because there was no way I was surviving on my own.""', u'The large portrait of David\'s ""father"", seen at the party is actually a portrait of the contemporary artist Robert Rauschenberg.', u'Michael Keaton, Harrison Ford, and Alec Baldwin were all considered for the role of Dr. Curtis McCabe.', u'David refers to Brian\'s speech as the ""sweet and sour speech"" even though it goes, ""Without the bitter, baby, the sweet ain\'t as sweet"".', u'The vintage car that Tom Cruise drives in the movie is a 1962 Ferrari 250 GTO.', u""Tom Cruise has said this is the best film he's done."", u""The Claude Monet painting which gives the film its title and which is seen during David's birthday party is the Seine at Argenteuil, 1873."", u'Cameron Crowe and Tom Cruise both tried to persuade legendary director Billy Wilder to make an appearance in the film, but he declined.', u'During the pop culture montage scene towards the end of the movie a picture of Nancy Wilson (wife of Cameron Crowe) from Heart can be seen.', u'In the cell, Carl Jung\'s book, ""Memories, Dreams, and Reflections"" can be seen on the table between David and McCabe. The book is all about Jung\'s personal dreams and how they helped him uncover his ""shadow"" and remove his persona (or ""mask"").', u""In the hallway at LE at the end of the movie, Alice Crowe (Cameron's mom) is the first face seen on the television monitors that are promoting LE's services."", u'In the Times Square sequence at the beginning of the movie, one of the images that flashes for only a few frames is of Katie Holmes on the cover of a magazine. Holmes later married Tom Cruise.', u'The smashed Gibson SG electric guitar is not a genuine Pete Townshend smashed guitar. It\'s a replica. Cameron Crowe says in his commentary that he ""really, really wished"" he had a genuine Townsend.', u'The line, ""Rumors of my death have been mildly exaggerated,"" is a Mark Twain line slightly tweaked. Twain said ""greatly"" rather than ""mildly.""', u'Many people have asked Cameron Crowe when a consumer version of the John Coltrane hologram will become available, only to be disappointed when informed it was all a visual effect. He explains, ""I conceptualized the idea of a holographic stereo to show that David Aames is rich, cutting edge and, because he publishes magazines, companies send him new technology in hopes of getting a product review. The invention doesn\'t actually exist, and was created using CGI - with classic Coltrane footage used as the source material.""', u'At the club, Sofia wears a t-shirt that says ""St. Rose."" Along with being the patron saint of Latin and South America , St. Rose is the Patron Saint of Vanity. St. Rose used to pray: ""Lord, increase my sufferings, and with them increase Your love in my heart.""', u'Cameron Crowe felt pressure to complete the film in six weeks because of a pending strike which would have halted production. The anticipated strike never happened.', u'The film opens with the song ""Everything in Its Right Place"" by Radiohead. Chorus of the song is ""Yesterday I woke up sucking on a lemon"" - These words relate directly to Brian Shelby\'s sweet and sour speeches.', u'Actors/musicians Mark Kozelek and John Fedevich (bassist Larry Fellows and drummer Ed Vallencourt from Almost Famous (2000)\'s Stillwater) make an appearance in Vanilla Sky. When David Aames is in the bathroom at the club, they both walk in and Mark says ""Fix your fuckin\' face"" as Ed walks silently behind him.', u""There are two times when Sofia calls David a pleasure delayer; she says it so subtly that it's almost missed."", u'The name of Kurt Russell\'s character, McCabe, was inspired by Nancy Wilson\'s first solo album, ""Live at McCabe\'s Guitar Shop"". Nancy Wilson is the wife of Cameron Crowe.', u'Crowe opens the official production notes with two lyrical quotes: 1) ""I once loved a woman, a child I\'m told. I gave her my heart but she wanted my soul,""- Bob Dylan, Don\'t Think Twice, It\'s All Right. 2) ""When you were young and on your own, how did it feel to be alone? I was always thinking of games that I was playing, trying to make the best of my time. But only love can break your heart. Try to be sure right from the start. Yes, only love can break your heart. What if your world should fall apart?"" - Neil Young, Only Love Can Break Your Heart.', u'Throughout the film, numerous characters order a Jack and Coke. This goes further to support Brian\'s ""sweet and sour"" argument that is the theme of the picture.', u""The filmmakers asked for, and received, a few paintings by animation legend Ralph Bakshi, to use in the set designs for Tom Cruise's apartment."", u'The second Cameron Crowe film to use a Peter Gabriel song. The first one being Say Anything... (1989).', u'One of the images seen briefly at the beginning of the film, as David runs down the street, is of Jann Wenner, editor of Rolling Stone magazine. The very magazine that Cameron Crowe infamously began writing for at a young age in the early 1970s.', u'The title Vanilla Sky was considered for Cameron Crowe\'s previous movie, Almost Famous (2000). The original title for Almost Famous was actually ""Untitled"", however Dreamworks would not allow this, so Cameron Crowe titled the bootleg edition of Almost Famous on DVD ""Untitled"".', u'There are two subtle lines that are clues when David is talking to Dr. McCabe while drawing Sophia. First he says, ""Everything\'s a nightmare."" And then, inaudibly because Dr. McCabe starts talking over him, he says, ""I feel like I\'m...in a dream"" right after saying, ""I don\'t feel like I killed someone"".', u'Cameron Diaz and Penelope Cruz reunite later in the film The Counselor (2013).', u'The scene with Tom Cruise and Pen\xe9lope Cruz in the street with a Volkswagen van in the back is a close copy (cars, jacket of Tom Cruise, attitude of the women...) of the cover of Bob Dylan\'s record ""The Freewheeling Bob Dylan"".', u'In the opening car scene between David and Brian, David reaches for music to play and he mentions Barcelona, Radiohead, and Looper (the last two which appear on the soundtrack).', u""Two paintings seen in David Aames' apartment were painted by Canadian-born singer-songwriter Joni Mitchell.

He's sitting next to the doctor who states they can do something about David's arm."", u'At the club, Brian tells Sofia that the bathroom is behind the girl who looks like Bj\xf6rk. Bjork pops up later during the pop culture montage of music/movies/television images when David is freaking out. When Noah Taylor\'s character compares life to a music video, Bjork\'s ""Big Time Sensuality"" is played. The video looks like it could\'ve been shot in Times Square.', u'David Aames\' alarm clock is a JVC FS-SD9. According to the manufacturer, the speaker cabinets have a ""real European cherry-wood finish, and are cylinder-shaped for smoother sound with more even dispersion."" It was brand-new and top-of-the-line when the film was made, it\'s long since been discontinued.', u""David Aames' birthday is September 22, 1968."", u""When David's secretary asks him to choose a cover for a magazine, the girl on the cover is actress/supermodel Izabella Miko (Coyote Ugly (2000)). In fact, that exact picture is available in Maxim magazine (August 2000 issue #32)."", u'Tara Lipinski was auditioning for a part in The Banger Sisters (2002) when she stopped by the set. Crowe saw her and offered her a cameo in the movie. She improvised a scene with Cameron Diaz. She had to stand on a box to get closer to Diaz\'s height since Lipinski is 5\'1"" and Diaz is 5\'9"". The scene didn\'t make the U.S. version, but can still be seen in the international versions of the movie.', u""Nancy Wilson's score has never been given an official commercial release.

To the lower right there is the message, ""PL: 51S1NT 4R51MS"", or ""Pleasant Dreams"".', u""When David is in need of tech support, listen for the bell rings and voices of the monitoring scientists. There is also the repetition of David's patient account number (30319) multiple times throughout the film (during glitches)."", u'According to Cameron Crowe\'s website, The Uncool, there are six supported theories on the nature of the film. The site reads, ""#1 - The movie is just as its explained. David commits suicide, he is frozen and the splice occurs, etc. The sound you hear is David awakening in the future. #2 - Everything up to the car wreck was ""real"" and the rest of the entire film was ALL in David\'s head as he lie in a coma (until the end when he wakes up). #3 - The entire film is a dream as David struggles with his vanity, his sexual past, his ideal woman, etc. The only ""real"" scene in the entire film would be the last, as he wakes up. #4 - The movie is writer Brian Shelby\'s fictional story about his friend (David Aames). A story of the sour and the sweet. He plays the unsung hero to the playboy. #5 - The whole thing is a dream in that the depictions we see take place as reflections within a dream. However, the events are real until the splice, at which time they become fiction. Tech support states that David has been asleep 125 years. David\'s sessions seem to be reflections of his past. I think a fair interpretation is that the reflections have been tampered with by the subconscious to reflect his love for Sophia and the regret of his carelessness with Julie. You are relying on the unreliable narrator as to the details like his love sort of being all around him before he meets her, his fears, dates and the music. Like retelling a story that you know ends badly, you may create clues to take the edge off or tip off your subconscious that this is a reflection, a memory, not reality. #6 - Christian Metaphors - A Story of Divinity - David commits suicide, finally driven to it by the guilt over the death of Julie Gianni. As he is dying, his life is passing before his eyes. While his life is passing before his eyes, he is also being tempted to sell his soul to the devil for the chance to make things right (i.e. the dream like Utopian scenes between Sophia and David). a. David is asked many times ""Did you sign a Contract? b. Lucid Dream, Lucifer? c. Both women at LE have red hair. d. Tilda Swinton has hot sauce behind her. e. More importantly, Tilda Swinton is exactly the kind of personality you would expect the devil to have at the time of one\'s death, vaguely sexy, assuring, calming, and persuasive... The ideas of David\'s Christlike-ness are from the following ideas. He dies at 33, as did Christ.. His father wrote ""THE BOOK""... The book was called Defending the Kingdom... The magazine is called Rise...""', u'Contrary to popular belief, the voice at the end of the film that says, ""Open Your Eyes"", is not Penelope Cruz. Listed in the credits as ""The Future"", the voice belongs to actress Laura Fraser.', u'The Uncool, Cameron Crowe\'s official website, says, ""at the party, when Brian Shelby comes into the second apartment where David and Sofia are talking, you can see his t-shirt with the words \'fantasy\' in sparkly sequins. This supports the idea that the whole movie (until the last scene where David wakes up) is all but a dream.""', u'Among the images shown in the montage at the end of the film are: Billy Crudup\'s character from Almost Famous (2000), David\'s doctor giving the middle finger to the camera, Monet\'s painting \'Seine at Argenteuil,\' the cover of Blind Faith\'s self-titled album, stills from deleted scenes, the cover of Frank Sinatra\'s In The Wee Small Hours, Cameron Crowe\'s sister leaving home with curlers in her hair (an event recreated in Almost Famous), Tom Cruise and Jason Lee (possible in-character) posing with snowboards (including the one David painted), Patrick Fugit and the band Stillwater walking from the plane in Almost Famous, the cover of Bruce Springsteen\'s The River, a clip of Audrey Hepburn in Sabrina (1954), a clip from The Red Balloon (1956), the cover of ""The Freewheelin\' Bob Dylan"", live footage of the band Sigur R\xf3s, a clip from Leave It to Beaver (1957), a photo of Tom Cruise winning a high school wrestling match, a clip from a Betty Boop cartoon, footage from The Who documentary The Kids Are Alright (1979), a picture of Martin Luther King, clip of Ursula Andress coming out of the water in Dr. No (1962), a photo of Kirsten Dunst, footage of the Astro Orbiter ride at Disneyland, clip from a Heckle and Jeckle cartoon, picture of Tom Cruise kissing his snowboard, the cover to Led Zeppelin\'s album Houses of the Holy, and a picture of Kate Hudson cuddled up to Patrick Fugit during production of Almost Famous. Much of the super-8 footage came from Cameron Crowe\'s old home movies from when he was growing up.', u'There is an audible ""splice"" when the lucid dream begins.', u'In the scenes with McCabe interviewing David in the prison cell, the word DREAM can be seen written backwards on a blackboard in the background.', u'The film takes place in 2151.', u'When David is awoken on the street by Sofia - where he chooses his splice to be - as Sofia crouches to talk to him we see the sky in the background. It is vibrantly colored and very much resembles a Monet painting, specifically ""The Seine at Argenteuil"" (Vanilla Sky). Another ""clue"" that this is where a lucid dream begins. Further, one can hear the sound effect of a tape rewinding and, as mentioned before, an audible ""splice.""', u'When asked by fans about clues to the film\'s ending, Crowe said, ""Songs for the film were chosen so that the lyrics constantly relay the emotion of the scene. When the characters aren\'t speaking, the lyrics take over and continue to carry the set emotion.....listen to them closely. For example, the song that plays over David leaving Sophia\'s in the morning is Jeff Buckley\'s, \'Last Goodbye,\' which that morning was there last one true goodbye. Yes, they see each other after this, but after the car wreck when both of their lives are forever changed. \'Last Goodbye\' also contains the lyrics: \'Kiss me, please kiss me, but kiss me out of desire, babe not consolation\' which follows David\'s plight rather well (as the next time he sees her is after the accident and he wants her affections but not sympathy for his disfigurement). Bruce Springsteen\'s \'The River\' album (featured in the closing montage) also has some lyrical significance. One of the best lines from the song \'The River\', is: \'Is a dream a lie if it don\'t come true, or is it something worse?\' Also, two R.E.M. songs are featured. Don\'t forget what R.E.M. stands for: Rapid Eye Movement. As in a state of sleep. It\'s when you dream.""', u""Tech Support (Noah Taylor) can clearly be seen standing in the corner of David's apartment when he's telling David about the three day memorial organized by Brian."", u'Cameron Crowe stated on his website, ""The events that take place directly after the splice (when the lucid dream begins) involve some of the \'sweetest\' scenes between David and Sofia (\'REM\'\'s \'The Sweetness Follows\'). This stands in contrast to the sour of Radiohead\'s \'Everything Is In Its Right Place\', which opens the film.""', u""The sticker on David's car reads 2/30/01, a fictional date. On the commentary, Cameron Crowe says that it was an accident, although it lead to one of the different interpretations of the story."", u'The PL51S1NT DR51MS message is also printed on the LIFE EXTENSION body bag after David swallows all the pills that end his ""life"".', u'When the film starts, a voice says ""open your eyes"" over and over.. first in Spanish (the title of the original film).. then in English. It\'s Sophia\'s voice, not Julie\'s. Julie\'s voice comes the second time, once David wakes up from his dream of deserted times square. What is odd is that he hasn\'t even met Sophia yet. Why is she in his dreams? Or does this support the theory that the entire movie is dream?', u'Cameron Crowe says, ""Brian Shelby jokes about being from Ohio, but it just so happens that Dr. McCabe is from Ohio. Could David see a little bit of Brian in his made up fellow?""', u'According to Cameron Crowe\'s website, ""You\'ll also find one single frame at the 03:55 mark which shows the fence that David and Julianna crash into. What does this mean? If you believe that David is recalling this dream to Dr. McCabe, then it\'s probably his subconscious playing tricks on him.""', u'Right before David collapses on the street after the nightclub, R.E.M.\'s ""Sweetness Follows"" plays. This is the moment right before the Splice where his Lucid Dream begins. R.E.M. is the portion of the sleep cycle where dreams take place.', u""The second time David wakes up (after seeing himself disfigured in the mirror), he makes two or three faces into the mirror. A smile and making a circle with his mouth. The lead character of Truffaut's Breathless did the same thing into a mirror more than once. Yet another clue that the dream is just a patchwork of David's pop culture influences."", u""During the quick montage of stills at the very end of the film, one of the shots (which lasts for only one frame) is of Dr. Pomerantz, David Aames's plastic surgeon (played by Armand Schultz), flipping the bird at the camera."", u'Two posters from the French New Wave are in David\'s bedroom, Breathless (1960) and Jules and Jim (1962). Crowe hero, Francois Truffaut wrote Breathless and directed Jules and Jim. These are significant later in the film when the ""lucid dream"" is revealed. Both Breathless and Jules and Jim deal with self-destructive free-spirited characters whose personal relationships suffer and violently end because of their own needs to be ""free"". Jules and Jim ends with Jeanne Moreau driving Henri Serre off a bridge in a car the same way Julie did to David in Vanilla Sky.', u'Cameron Crowe featured ""number stations"" (the infamous short-wave radio stations that transmit coded messages) from the CD set The Conet Project in the film.', u'David shares seats on the board with people whom he calls ""The Seven Dwarfs,"" each of whom represents one of the dwarves from the Disney version of the story. David has his body frozen through cryonics after death. There was a widespread and persistent rumor that Walt Disney, a media magnate also associated with the Seven Dwarfs, had his body frozen after death.', u'The film\'s plot was speculated to be the same as Total Recall (1990): In this film, David (Tom Cruise) volunteers to live a life offered to him through a virtual reality program after he is disfigured in an auto accident and is put in a stasis chamber in deep space and is provide with memories to keep his mind activate but there\'s a glitch. In Total Recall (1990) Quaid (Played by Arnold Schwarzenegger) gets a memory implantation of being a secret agent on Mars which goes terribly wrong. Total Recall (1990) is inspired by the Philip K. Dick short story ""We Can Remember It For You Wholesale"". Tom Cruise later went on to star in Minority Report (2002). The film is loosely based on the Phillip K. Dick short story ""The Minority Report"".']","[u'USA::10 December 2001\n (premiere)', u'USA::14 December 2001', u'Taiwan::16 December 2001\n (premiere)', u'Singapore::18 December 2001\n (premiere)', u'Australia::20 December 2001', u'Hong Kong::20 December 2001', u'South Korea::21 December 2001', u'Japan::22 December 2001', u'Singapore::25 December 2001', u'Mexico::28 December 2001', u'Taiwan::29 December 2001', u'Portugal::18 January 2002', u'Belgium::23 January 2002', u'Egypt::23 January 2002', u'France::23 January 2002', u'Argentina::24 January 2002', u'Switzerland::24 January 2002 (German speaking region)', u'Czech Republic::24 January 2002', u'Germany::24 January 2002', u'Hungary::24 January 2002', u'Israel::24 January 2002', u'Netherlands::24 January 2002', u'Peru::24 January 2002', u'Russia::24 January 2002', u'Austria::25 January 2002', u'Brazil::25 January 2002', u'Colombia::25 January 2002', u'Finland::25 January 2002', u'UK::25 January 2002', u'Greece::25 January 2002', u'Ireland::25 January 2002', u'Iceland::25 January 2002', u'Sweden::25 January 2002', u'Turkey::25 January 2002', u'South Africa::25 January 2002', u'Cyprus::1 February 2002', u'Denmark::1 February 2002', u'Estonia::1 February 2002', u'Spain::1 February 2002', u'Italy::1 February 2002', u'Norway::1 February 2002', u'Philippines::7 February 2002 (Manila)', u'Philippines::13 February 2002 (Davao)', u'Kuwait::12 March 2002', u'Poland::15 March 2002', u'Bulgaria::5 April 2002', u'Finland::5 July 2002 (re-release)']",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Opponents of the predator theory maintain that a T-Rex\'s arms were too short to hold down a prey, and that it would not have been able to run as fast as its prey due to its bulk; additionally, its excellent sense of smell would serve to sniff already dead prey over large distances. Supporters of the predator theory point at the fact that T-Rexes had depth perception, a trait seen mainly in predators so that they can estimate the distance to their prey.

Attenborough previously directed Mazzello in Shadowlands (1993). In that film, Howard's wife, Debra Winger, played Mazzello's mother."", u'The first and only time that both a second T-Rex and the infant are shown in the franchise.', u'This film features two actors from the ""Death Wish"" series of films. Jeff Goldblum played Freak #1 in the original ""Death Wish"" and Thomas F. Duffy played Nirvana in ""Death Wish 2"". Both were the causes of Charles Bronson\'s vigilante rampage.', u'Richard Schiff (Eddie)) and Thomas Rosales Jr (Carter), previously co starred in Speed, as with this movie they shared no scenes.', u""An alternate opening was for a Japanese fishing boat to pull up a Parasaurolophus carcass in it's net, To which the net breaks from the weight of the carcass and disappears into the waters below. Paul Mejias supervised the construction of the sculpture and even though this alternate opening scene never made the final cut, the carcass was still used in the film in the scenes taken place in the Tyrannosaurus Nest and the boneyard."", u'The vocalizations of Parasaurolophus were created from cows calling through tubes.', u'In the script instead of the Parasaurolophus Elvis, Dieter Stark captures a Corythosaurus (misspelled ""Carninthosaur"" in the script) though this scene was cut from the final film, it is included in Mighty Chronicles adaptation of the Lost World Jurassic Park. This early design choice is also referenced in the film itself with Roland carrying a factsheet of Corythosaurus and even misidentifies the Parasaurolophus as a corythosaur.', u""The game trail was filmed completely on location in Northern California near the Redwoods State Park,shots of the trail were split between two locations: Patrick's Point State Park, and a private ranch in Fieldbrook;the sequence starts in Patrick's Point on a road, Before splicing the private ranch for the opening shot of the trail itself. to increase the perceived size of the ranch,The InGen vehicles were driven in large circles to give the impression that the location was larger than it really was, shots taken of Ian Malcolm's team atop a rocky outcrop where again taken at Patrick's Point State Park, on Ceremonial Rock. The scene then continues on the private ranch to it's close."", u'When Dr. Robert Burke encounters Dieter Stark with a Compsognathus during the capture of the dinosaurs on the Game Trail, he identifies it as ""Compsognathus Triassicus"" there is no such species of Compsognathus known by this name, rather it was a combination of the genus Compsognathus and the species Procompsognathus Triassicus,though this is merely an error by the script-writers, it is unknown if there is a species called ""Compsognathus Triassicus"" in the film canon or if it was simply an error that Dr. Burke made, despite the possibility that the films Compies are actually Procompsognathus, Paleontologist and consultant for the film\'s Dr. Jack Horner said in the past that they were indeed Compsognathus.', u'As a thank-you to Steven Spielberg, Industrial Light & Magic created an animation that features a pack of Compsognathus wearing bow ties, top hats and holding canes tap dancing, it was included in Beyond Jurassic Park and in the Lost World Jurassic Park Blu-Ray.', u'When Dieter is attacked by the pack of Compsognathus\'s he can be heard swearing in Swedish, saying ""Helvetes j\xe4vlar"" which means ""Hell\'s Devils"".', u'The reason for Stegosaurus being in the film was because Steven Spielberg received ""literally thousands"" of letters,many of which came from children, inquiring why stegosaurus was absent in the first film. Conceptual artist for the first three films, Mark ""Cash"" McCreery had previously expressed in the Jurassic Park Topps trading cards his regret That stegosaurus was not among the dinosaurs that appeared in Jurassic Park. As Colin Wilson recalled, ""Steven made that his mission- to come up with a really good stegosaurus sequence"" two animatronic stegosauruses were created for the film, one was an adult whose maquettes an animatronic were created by a five-person team headed by Mark Maitre and Scott Stoddard with Al Sousa and Kirk Skodis being in charge of the mechanical armature of the animatronic. The second animatronic was the juvenile stegosaurus ""Claire"" whose animatronic was sculpted and painted by Dave Grasso and mechanized by Bob Mano.', u'Despite concept art and one of the maquettes of the adult Stegosaurus depicting it with its tail dragging like older restorations the stegosaurs in this film and the following sequel lacked this trait, although the stegosaurus in Jurassic world would feature it briefly dragging its tail along with a Triceratops that did the same.like with the Pachycephalosaurus which appears in the movie also with stegosaurus, the stegosaurus went through many changes in terms of its coloration. Mark Maitre was responsible for creating a total of six of these conceptual skin colorations.', u'Both Stegosaur animatronics were transported to Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park in California for the filming of the stegosaurus skirmish.The juvenile animatronic was the only practical Stegosaur that was filmed as Steven Spielberg, Stan Winston, and stunt coordinator Gary Hymes agreed that stunts with the adult Stegosaur animatronic would be potentially dangerous- particularly because of its spike tail- and filming with the adult was rescheduled for one of the stages of Universal Studios feeling these stunts would be safer inside a controlled environment. ultimately, almost all the shots of the adult stegosaurus were created in CGI with the animatronic only being used in close-up shots, such as the caged stegosaur that Nick and Sarah approach when infiltrating the camp of the InGen hunters.', u'The sounds of the Pachycephalosaurus consisted of several vocalizations with some sounding much aggressive or ominously threatening, the vocals are portrayed as raspy or blunt consisting of squawks or bleats from both vultures, sheep, goats and moans from a camel and rhino.', u'The vocalizations for the juvenile tyrannosaur were of a baby camel crying for its mother.', u'Interestingly, in the script for the Lost World Jurassic Park the identity of Pachycephalosaur captured by the hunters was more vague as Burke initially identifies it as Pachycephalosaurus but later afterwards identifies the animal as either once again being Pachycephalosaurus or Prenocephale.', u'The pactical effect of the Pachycephalosaurus was sculpted and painted by Scott Stoddard and was mechanized by Jeff Edwards and Rich Haugen. there were three versions that were created and employed for use in the film, these three variants were a full size hydraulic puppet, an insert head, an animatronic of the Pachy in a ramming stance when it headbutts one of the vehicles of the hunters, also to know is that the Pachycephalosaurus was the only dinosaur in the round up scene that was not purely portrayed with CGI.', u'Pteranodon was ultimately chosen instead of the novels Cearadactylus probably because of its larger size, more spectacular/impressive appearance and massive popularity with audiences.', u'The screech the Pteranodon makes at the end was made by Gary Rydstrom slowing down the sound of him taking out tooth floss from his box.', u'This film saw the introduction of male Raptors with a different color scheme than those of the ones before and the female seen in the film. Stan Winston explained the reasoning behind the new color schemes of the Raptors and other dinosaurs by saying ""we had to design new paint schemes not only for the new dinosaurs, but for some of the already designed dinosaurs from the last movie, because now there were male dinosaurs, as well as females and typically in nature, the males of any species are far more brightly colored. We also wanted to make sure the audience would be able to tell the males and females apart."" the final coloration that was chosen for the male velociraptor was a tiger-like color scheme devised by Chris Swift.', u'The scene where the the female Tyrannosaur pokes her head through the waterfall to find the humans that are hiding from her and licks Sarah Harding is taken from the chapter ""Tyrannosaur"" of the Jurassic Park novel when Rexy does the same to Tim Murphy. This scene was originally planned to be in the first film, but was never used.', u'Carter\'s (Thomas Rosales Jr.) famous words, ""ten,fifteen minutes"" when asked when he last saw Dieter were taken from a security guard who worked at Jurassic Park in the first novel.', u'Roland claims to have ""seen"" parts of Isla sorna before the events of the movie, suggesting he was very widely traveled and had toured the island many years before the dinosaurs were bred there.', u'Unlike the film, in the novel the RV goes over the cliff, not the trailer it pulls. In reality, it would not be likely that the second trailer could hold the weight of the first trailer; once the engine went over, the rest would easily be pulled over. However, it is possible that the first trailer was much, much lighter than an average RV, due to its electric engine, lightly built design. Also Eddie goes through the first trailer with a rope to send down to Ian, Sarah, and Nick; however, he travels through the accordion-connector, which is essentially impossible. When the second trailer is flipped by the rexes, the connector would be twisted shut like in the novel, yet Carr is able to easily climb through the passage and toss the rope down.', u'The dependence of young Tyrannosaurus on their parents is very apparent with this baby dinosaur. When it is injured and taken away from its parents, it barely ever stops howling for them, indicating that it is not yet capable of surviving on its own and requires its parents to come to its rescue.', u'For the vocalizations of the male tyrannosaur, pigs and ""weird Costa Rican mammals"",were used mammals that Gary Rydstrom and his team recorded but never knew what their identities were, had a similar screech like the baby elephant used for the females and were used in place of the latter. The original T. rex roars from Jurassic Park (1993) were also reused for the female tyrannosaur', u'Steven Spielberg: Reflected in the TV broadcasting the CNN story about the return of the dinosaurs, sitting on the couch next to Jeff Goldblum and eating popcorn.', u'Steven Spielberg: [Signs] Using a sign with directions or instructions as a joke. In this case, the T-Rex crosses the pier at the San Diego port bearing a sign that reads, ""No animals or vegetables beyond this point.""', u""Steven Spielberg: [father] Malcolm admits he's a bad father."", u'The script called for a scene where the Velociraptors got on board the Venture as it was about to set sail. As chaos ensued, the T-Rex also got loose, and killed everything else aboard. This explains why many of the crew members are dead in places the Rex cannot reach. The scene was never filmed.', u'In the novel of ""Jurassic Park"", the characters of both John Hammond and Ian Malcolm died (though Malcolm returned in the novel ""The Lost World"" (1997), explaining that ""The doctors did excellent work.""). In the film version, however, both characters survived, allowing them to return in this movie.', u'There are 13 on-camera deaths, 10 on the island and 3 in the city, the second of all three films. Jurassic World has taken first for 25 deaths.', u'The closing scene of this film, a view of the dinosaurs living undisturbed on the island, includes pterosaurs. They were considered for action sequences in both of the first two films, but these were abandoned, making this brief clip their first onscreen appearance. They featured prominently in the first novel, in a sequence that took place in a pterosaur aviary; this was finally realized in Jurassic Park III (2001), and revisited in Jurassic World (2015).', u'David Koepp lifted several set pieces from the original Jurassic Park novel for use in this sequel. These include: The Procompsognathuses (compys) attacking the young girl; hiding from the T-rex behind a waterfall, while the creature tries to find them using its tongue; Dieter Stark being killed by Procompsognathids (compys) (Hammond in the novel); Roland Tembo tranquilizing the T-rex (Robert Muldoon in the novel).', u""It's curious that Roland wishes to hunt the male/buck Tyrannosaurus, when the female Tyrannosaurus is actually larger. This could possibly stem from the fact that Roland is a professional hunter, and in sport hunting it is the male that is usually prized for its size and adornment. Roland may not have known that it is the female that holds the size."", u""Dr Malcolm accuses Peter Ludlow in the mansion of lying about the facts surrounding the deaths of 3 people during the course of events in the first film. In fact, four people died in the first film: Ray Arnold (Samuel L. Jackson'), Robert Muldoon (Bob Peck), Donald Gennaro (Martin Ferrero) and Dennis Nedry (Wayne Knight); five if you include the worker at the beginning who is killed by the velociraptor. However, the worker's death already occurred before the main events of the first movie (it was the reason why a team of experts was sent to Jurassic Park in the first place), so Ludlow could not have lied about it. None of the characters could have known of Nedry's fate since he absconded with the eggs early on, and his death was not witnessed, so his status is most likely 'missing, presumed dead'."", u""In Michael Crichton's novel, the opposing group on the island is not led by Peter Ludlow (who does not exist in either novel), but rather by Lewis Dodgson, head of the rival company BioSyn, who had hired Dennis Nedry in the previous film. Dodgson hides from the T-Rex under a Jeep with Sarah Harding, who kicks him out to lead the T-Rex away. The T-Rex takes him home to its nest to feed to its young. This is closely paralleled by the fate of Ludlow in the film."", u'The S.S. Venture, which transports the Tyrannosaurus to San Diego, is a reference to King Kong, who was transported to New York City on a ship called the S.S. Venture.', u'If you look closely, the face of the male/buck Tyrannosaurus is adorned with many facial scars and many of the teeth in his mouth are missing or broken. This is indicative towards the Rex participating in fights for mating rights or dominance.', u'WILHELM SCREAM: Not the classic Wilhelm, but ""the second scream"" is heard as Eddie is being eaten by the Mother and Father Tyrannosaurs.', u""The ship that transports the T-Rex to San Diego, the Venture, is named after the ship in King Kong (1933). This is the series' second reference to the classic film, the gate in the first film was modeled on the Skull Island gate with Ian Malcolm pointing this out."", u""It was mentioned that the juvenile T-rex was a couple of weeks old. It would have been too long for it to be that old, although it's implied that InGen accelerated the growth of their dinosaurs which could account for the issue."", u'The tranquilizer gun Roland uses to tranqulize the male Tyrannosaur is a LAR Grizzly Big Boar.', u'The car Ian Malcolm drives, is a 1969 Pontiac custom S.', u'Due to a recent discovery of specimens of juvenile T-rexes, it is possible that infant T-rexes actually had longer skulls, therefore making the infant T-rex in this movie unrealistic. However, the dinosaurs in the Jurassic Park novels and films were genetically engineered by splicing together DNA from several different sources, as was explained in the first book and movie. Therefore, the appearances of all of the dinosaurs, would be dependent upon their respective genetic makeup.', u'Originally, the baby T-rex was suppose to be brown, as seen on one of his marquettes in the behind-the-scenes featurette, meaning that he might have originally been planned to be female instead of male.', u'There\'s concept art that exists for the Lost World that depicts a T-rex with a brownish skin color in a cage being hauled away, though the ILM website states that the concept art is for the first film, the concept art can be proven to actually come from this film due to the bottom right corner of the artwork having the words ""Lost World"", and because the T-Rex in the concept art is in a cage but is brown instead of green like the male T-Rex ""Buck"" who is captured in the film, this could suggest that the female T-rex ""Doe"" was originally going to be the T-Rex brought to San Diego instead of the male ""Buck"" or that both Tyrannosaurus were to be captured.', u'The hunters use Dan Inject Dartguns to capture the dinosaurs.', u""The arrival of Ian Malcolm's daughter seems to come as a surprise to him and it also seems that until her surprise appearance on the island, no contingency had been put in place for her care.""]","[u'USA::19 May 1997 (Los Angeles, California)\n (premiere)', u'USA::23 May 1997', u'Australia::29 May 1997', u'Singapore::5 June 1997', u'Philippines::10 June 1997', u'Colombia::13 June 1997', u'South Korea::14 June 1997', u'Brazil::20 June 1997', u'Argentina::26 June 1997', u'Hong Kong::26 June 1997', u'New Zealand::26 June 1997', u'Mexico::27 June 1997', u'South Africa::27 June 1997', u'Japan::12 July 1997', u'UK::18 July 1997', u'Ireland::18 July 1997', u'Israel::18 July 1997', u'Iceland::18 July 1997', u'China::7 August 1997', u'Germany::7 August 1997', u'Switzerland::8 August 1997', u'Spain::22 August 1997', u'Serbia::27 August 1997 (Belgrade)', u'Slovenia::28 August 1997', u'Republic of Macedonia::4 September 1997', u'Finland::5 September 1997', u'Italy::5 September 1997', u'Norway::5 September 1997', u'Poland::5 September 1997', u'Estonia::12 September 1997', u'France::12 September 1997 (Deauville Film Festival)', u'Denmark::19 September 1997', u'Sweden::19 September 1997', u'Turkey::19 September 1997', u'Kuwait::24 September 1997', u'Czech Republic::25 September 1997', u'Hungary::25 September 1997', u'Netherlands::25 September 1997', u'Portugal::26 September 1997', u'Luxembourg::17 October 1997', u'Belgium::22 October 1997', u'France::22 October 1997', u'Czech Republic::6 December 2004 (DVD premiere)']",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The pauses in his dialogue were therefore not for dramatic effect, but rather waiting for his next line.', u'For the bug chamber sequence, Kate Capshaw was covered with over two thousand bugs.', u'While filming the whipping scene, the crew played a practical joke on Harrison Ford. While he was chained to a large stone, Barbra Streisand appeared, dressed in a leather dominatrix outfit. She proceeded to whip him, saying ""That\'s for Hanover Street (1979), the worst movie I ever saw."" She continued whipping him for Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977), and making all of that money. Carrie Fisher then threw herself in front of Ford to protect him, and Irvin Kershner chided Director Steven Spielberg. ""Is this how you run your movies?"" This entire sequence was filmed.', u'Steven Spielberg said that he did not enjoy this film as much as the rest of the Indiana Jones films, but said that it was a great experience for him, because he met his future wife, Kate Capshaw, during the production of this movie.', u""Jonathan Ke Quan's film debut. An open casting call was put out to all the elementary schools to find a young Asian actor to play Short Round. Jonathan Ke Quan arrived with his brother, not to audition, but merely to provide moral support. He caught the Casting Director's attention, because he spent the entire time of his brother's audition telling him what to do, and what not to do. Steven Spielberg liked his personality, so he and Harrison Ford improvised the scene where Short Round accuses Indy of cheating during a card game. Kwan won the role over about six thousand other auditions."", u'The ""chilled monkey brains"" were made from custard and raspberry sauce.', u'An unmade script that became Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008) had Indiana reveal what happened to Willie, saying, ""Last I heard, she married a big-shot director."" This is an in-joke, as Kate Capshaw married Steven Spielberg.', u'Kate Capshaw had to be taught how to scream.', u'In the ""Making Of"" Documentary for this movie, George Lucas said that although he originally intended for Temple of Doom to have a darker tone compared to Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) (much like Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980) was darker than Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977)), he admitted that he made it much darker than he intended, part of the reason being that he was going through a divorce at the time, and was ""not in a good mood"". Steven Spielberg also admitted that although he agreed with Lucas\' idea for a darker-toned film, he felt uncomfortable with certain scenes while filming them, and would attempt to inject some humorous elements into those scenes trying to lighten them up. The scene where Indy is fighting the Thuggee chief guard with a hammer, and the guard takes the hammer away and tosses it aside, only to have it land on a bystander\'s head, knocking him out with a comical thud, is a prime example of this scene ""lightening up"".', u""Amrish Puri shaved his head for the role of Mola Ram, creating such an impression, that he kept it shaved, and became one of India's most popular film villains."", u'Kate Capshaw\'s dress in the Shanghai club was completely made of 1920\'s and 1930\'s original beads. This meant that there was only enough to make one dress. The opening dance number was actually the last scene to be shot, but the dress did feature in some earlier location shots in Sri Lanka, in particular, a nighttime one with Harrison Ford and Kate Capshaw sitting by a campfire, with the dress drying on a nearby tree. Unfortunately, an elephant had started to eat the entire back of the dress, which was saved just in time. Consequently, some emergency repair work had to be done with what remained of the original beads, and it was Costume Designer Anthony Powell who had to fill out the insurance forms.

Steven Spielberg jokingly says that the only reason Kate married him later, was because he allowed the scene to be cut.', u'Kate Capshaw was very critical of Willie\'s character, saying that she was ""not much more than a dumb screaming blonde"".', u'Filmmakers were unable to get permission to shoot scenes in India. The Indian government requested a copy of the script, and demanded that the word ""Maharajah"" be removed, fearing that the content did not reflect their culture. As a result, production was moved to Sri Lanka, where some locations were also used for The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957).', u'Steven Spielberg said in 1989, ""I wasn\'t happy with Temple of Doom at all. It was too dark, too subterranean, and much too horrific. I thought it out-poltered Poltergeist (1982). There\'s not an ounce of my own personal feeling in Temple of Doom."" He later added during the Making of Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom documentary, ""Temple of Doom is my least favorite of the trilogy. I look back and I say, \'Well the greatest thing that I got out of that was I met Kate Capshaw. We married years later, and that to me was the reason I was fated to make Temple of Doom.""', u'During production, the movie was starting to go over-budget, and Spielberg went to Writers Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz, and asked them to make changes to the script in order to save money. They removed one page from the script, and saved a million dollars. It was a planned air chase scene using vintage biplanes. The scene was removed from the movie, and was later incorporated into Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989).', u'All of the scenes involving the long rope bridge were filmed on three different continents. The entire bridge itself was built on-location in Sri Lanka, and the scenes where Indiana cuts the bridge were filmed there also. The scenes where the bridge is hanging along the side of the cliff, with everyone hanging on, were filmed at Elstree Studios in London. Finally, the alligators at the end, were shot by Frank Marshall in Florida.', u""In the U.S., this film and Gremlins (1984) led to the creation of the PG-13 rating. Many people felt both movies were too violent for a PG rating, but not violent enough for an R rating. Some believed that both films would have been rated R if Steven Spielberg's name hadn't been attached (which is nonsense). The Flamingo Kid (1984) was the first film to receive a PG-13 rating, but it sat on the shelves for five months before being released. Red Dawn (1984) was the first film released with a PG-13 rating."", u""The three main characters are named after dogs. Short Round was named after Screenwriter Willard Huyck's dog, which was named after the orphan in The Steel Helmet (1951), Willie was named after Steven Spielberg's dog and Indiana was named after George Lucas' dog."", u'The production was fortunate in their main location in the town of Kandy, Sri Lanka, as nearby, a British engineering company was building a dam. When it came time for the film crew to shoot on a suspension bridge over a gorge, the British engineers were able to design and build one for them very quickly.', u'The film\'s original title was ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Death"", which was changed, because it sounded too foreboding. It was retained as the film\'s German title (""Indiana Jones und der Tempel des Todes"").', u'When the two swordsmen attack Indiana on the cliff, and he attempts to reprise his response from the ""basket scene"" from Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) by reaching for his gun, a bit of music from the basket scene is heard.', u'Kate Capshaw was thrilled at the opportunity of singing and dancing in the opening musical number, but the reality was her dress was so tight, there was very little movement she could attempt without ripping it.', u'Lawrence Kasdan (Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)\'s Screenwriter) was asked to write the script. ""I didn\'t want to be associated with Temple of Doom"", he reflected. ""I just thought it was horrible. It\'s so mean. There\'s nothing pleasant about it. I think Temple of Doom represents a chaotic period in both their (Lucas and Spielberg) lives, and the movie is very ugly, and mean-spirited.""', u'George Lucas, Steven Spielberg, Gloria Katz and Willard Huyck were concerned how to keep the audience interested, while explaining the Thugee cult. Huyck and Katz proposed a tiger hunt, but Spielberg said, ""There\'s no way I\'m going to stay in India long enough to shoot a tiger hunt."" They eventually decided on a dinner scene involving eating bugs, monkey brains, and the like. ""Steve and George both still react like children, so their idea was to make it as gross as possible,"" says Katz.', u'The only Indiana Jones movie that does not show or make any references to the Ark of the Covenant. This is because the movie takes place one year before Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), so Indiana has yet to become interested in the Ark.', u""Part of the sound effect heard as the engines run out of fuel on the plane (at 0:16:54 and 0:16:57) is the same failing-engine sound effect used when Han Solo's Millennium Falcon fails to crank up in Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980)."", u'For the scene where Willie stirs up the soup, and several eyeballs rise to the surface, Steven Spielberg said that this particular scene was notoriously difficult to shoot, and it took many takes to get the result seen in the final film. The eyeballs were attached to the bottom of the soup bowl with stick-ups, and Kate Capshaw was supposed to give the soup a good stir in order to release the eyes, so they could rise to the surface, but the stick-ups held pretty tight, and for many takes, only one or two of the eyes would release and rise to the surface.', u'As he knew that he would spend a large portion of film shirtless, Harrison Ford underwent a strict weightlifting regimen to prepare for the film. In an interview on the DVD release, he credits being in such good shape for his quick recovery from a back injury while filming.', u'The huge mineshaft was a circular construction around the largest soundstage. To make it look different, they just altered the lighting every time the carts completed a loop.', u'The only installment of the Indiana Jones franchise in which Indy does not make physical contact with a snake. There is, however, a nod to his fear of them, and to a scene from Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981). After he retrieves the Sankara stones from the Kali shrine, he looks up at a statue of a cobra poised to strike (like the one he famously faced in the Well of Souls scene in ""Raiders"") and straightens his hat. In the campfire scene, Willie mistakes a snake for an elephant trunk. While she grabs it and tosses it aside in annoyance, Indy is visibly disturbed by the snake\'s presence. This reinforces Indy\'s fear of snakes quite clearly.', u'George Lucas made the film a prequel, as he did not want the Nazis to be the villains once more.', u""In Club Obi-Wan, the artifact Indiana Jones is told to hand over, is the remains of Nurhaci, emperor of China from 1616-1626. Nurhaci founded the Manchu Qing dynasty, China's last imperial dynasty (1616-1911)."", u'This is the only Indiana Jones movie not to have any scenes that take place in North America, nor have even a passing mention of the Marcus Brody character.', u'Sharon Stone was one of the top choices for the role of Willie Scott before Kate Capshaw auditioned. Stone later starred in King Solomon\'s Mines (1985) and its sequel, Allan Quatermain and the Lost City of Gold (1986), two films that attempted to duplicate the success of the ""Indiana Jones"" franchise. Also, Markie Post of Night Court (1984) fame, was heavily considered for the role of Willie Scott.', u'The ""giant vampire bats"" that are shown in the movie, were actually fruit bats. Vampire bats are a lot smaller.', u'Over two hundred forty 70mm prints of the film were made, the largest number ever for a single release.', u'An early draft of the script for Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) had Indiana Jones traveling to Shanghai to recover a piece of the Staff of Ra. During his escape from the museum where it was housed, he sheltered from machine gun fire behind a giant rolling gong. The same script also featured Indiana and Marion fleeing destruction in a minecart chase. Both of these scenes were cut from that script, but resurface in this movie.', u'During the sacrifice, Mola Ram chants in Hindi, imploring ""Kali Ma Shakti de,"" asking for the ""Spiritual power of Mother Kali.""', u""Short Round's car is a 1936 Auburn Boat-tail Speedster, a highly popular car in the 1930s."", u'The only Indiana Jones movie to display its title on-screen using the famous Indiana Jones typeface, and perhaps the only movie to ever show its title partially obscured by an object (in this case, Kate Capshaw) in the foreground.', u'Ernie Fosselius, Director of Hardware Wars (1978), provided the voices of the two Chinese pilots for the biplane scene. Sound Designer Ben Burtt had Fosselius record a gag line as a prank on Steven Spielberg. During a screening, which Fosselius attended, Spielberg was surprised and bemused when, at the ending, Indiana Jones delivers the stone to the Shaman who then exclaimed ""Wait a minute! You brought back the wrong stone!"" Spielberg leapt to his feet and demanded an explanation, which made Fosselius very fearful, until it was explained to be a joke. Spielberg began to laugh and the incident ended happily.', u'The village shaman refers to the Sankara stone as ""Shiva linga"". In traditional Hinduism, the linga is a tall, cylindrical stone representative of a phallus, often set inside a circle representing the yoni, or female organ. Together, the two symbols stand for the dualistic sexual energy of the god Shiva.', u'Around six thousand actors auditioned worldwide for the part of Short Round. Jonathan Ke Quan was cast after his brother auditioned for the role. Steven Spielberg liked his personality, so he and Harrison Ford improvised the scene where Short Round accuses Indiana of cheating during a card game.', u'In the scene where Willie is about to be sacrificed, a lightsaber power-up sound effect can be heard when the doors to the lava pit are opened, referencing George Lucas, who directed four of the Star Wars movies, and who was also one of the Executive Producers of this movie.', u""Although it's never mentioned in the film, according to the novelization, Willie's full first name is Wilhelmina, and Short Round's real name is Wan Li."", u'Most of the cavernous mine where the minecart chase takes place is miniature, with the walls made of painted aluminium foil.', u""The first film to use THX's Theatre Alignment Program, which ensures that cinemas showing the film meet stringent technical and presentation standards."", u'In the beginning of the film, the man who directs Indiana and Willy to the plane (the one who explains he will be in a plane with chickens) is Dan Aykroyd.', u""George Lucas' initial idea for Indiana's sidekick was a virginal young princess, but Willard Huyck, Gloria Katz, and Steven Spielberg disliked the idea."", u""David Niven was attached to the role of Captain Phillip Blumburtt (Philip Stone), but died before filming began.

The only red line travel sequence shown in the film is when Indiana and his party travel from Shanghai to the Himalaya Mountains.', u""The name of villain Lao Che in the film's prologue is a nod to Lio Sha, leader of the evil title organization in Fritz Lang's silent-era films H\xe4m\xe4h\xe4kit 1: Kultainen j\xe4rvi (1919) and H\xe4m\xe4h\xe4kit 2: Briljanttilaiva (1920), which inspired the Indiana Jones series to an extent."", u""Jonathan Ke Quan's film debut."", u'All of the people in the Indian village speak ""Sinhala,"" one of the languages of Sri Lanka, as opposed to Hindi, the Indian language.

Lucas deliberately wanted to go with something with a darker tone, as this had served him well with Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980).', u'In military parlance a ""short round"" is an artillery shell that falls short of the target.', u'Originally, the Amber Palace in Jaipur was going to be used for all the exterior shots of Pankot Palace, when the movie was originally going to be filmed in India, but after negotiations between Producer Robert Watts and the Indian Government for permission to film in India broke down, and filming was moved to Sri Lanka, matte paintings were used for the exterior shots of the palace, with the interior shots filmed at Elstree Studios in London.', u'The film came under fire when it was released for being racist and far too violent for an Indiana Jones film.', u""According to some sources, Harrison Ford was not entirely comfortable with the film's story and, again, according to some sources, he was not entirely happy with how the film turned out either."", u'Steven Spielberg originally wanted to bring Marion Ravenwood back, with Abner Ravenwood being considered as a possible character.', u""This was Kate Capshaw's second theatrical film."", u'DIRECTOR_TRADEMARK(Steven Spielberg): [hat]: Grabbing fallen hat under a descending door at last minute.', u""The rotating tabletop used to exchange items in the opening Club Obi-Wan sequence is still common in Shanghai restaurants.

The walls of the cavernous mine were made of painted aluminum foil. For live-action shots, the huge mine shaft was a circular construction around the largest soundstage. To make it look different, they just altered the lighting every time the carts completed a loop.', u'The plane belonging to ""Lao Che Air Freight"" that Indy, Short Round, and Willie use to escape from Shanghai is a Ford Trimotor 5-AT-B, first built in 1929. The Trimotors were Ford\'s first (and only) attempt at making airliners. Since the first mass-produced Ford car (the Model T) was known as the ""Tin Lizzie"", many pilots affectionately nicknamed the Trimotor the ""Tin Goose"".', u'The particular Ford Trimotor belonging to ""Lao Che Air Freight"" in the movie, was also used many decades before in the 1930 Trans World Airlines promotional film, ""Coast to Coast in 48 Hours"", appearing on-screen with Amelia Earhart.', u'George Lucas, Willard Huyck, and Gloria Katz had been developing Radioland Murders (1994) since the early 1970s. The opening music was taken from that script and applied to Temple of Doom. Steven Spielberg reflected, ""George\'s idea was to start the movie with a musical number.

When the time came for Short Round to cross the pit, the bridge had caught fire under the intense heat, and Indiana and Willie managed to save him in the nick of time from falling in the lava pit. With the bridge crumbled, the trio had to find another way out, and that was through the mines. As with the above scenes, the most logical explanation for this cut seems to be the pace, and not the film's running time, since it ended up at one hour and fifty-three minutes.

Dodge Monacos from 1974-77 (including the upscale Royal Monaco), especially those which came with the A38 police option, are now considered as collector\'s items, since they have been used as replica Chicago P.D. and Illnois State Police cars, including Bluesmobile tribute cars. This has led to the scarcity of this generation of Mopar C-bodies, leading to some replica squad cars and Bluesmobiles using the Plymouth Gran Fury as a substitute, in addition to the Chrysler Newport.

If you look closely, as the camera tracks Blue Lou darting into the Bluesmobile, the argument has escalated into a fight.', u'When Cab Calloway originally recorded ""Minnie The Moocher"" in the 1930s, the chorus lyrics were simply ""Ho-dee-hody"" rather than the lengthened ""Hody-hody-hody ho"". In an interview, Calloway explained that one time when he was singing the song, he suddenly forgot the words, so he immediately shouted ""Hody-Hody-Hody-ho!"", and carried on the song that way.

Jake is seen without hat and sunglasses for the opening sequence in the prison, until he is given them by the corrections officer. His face is not seen at this time.

The band played with Sam & Dave on all of their Stax releases.', u'When John Landis found out that film\'s budget was 17.5 million dollars, he said, half-jokingly, ""I think we\'ve spent that much already.""', u'At the end, after the Universal Studios logo is shown, there is an ad for Universal Studios in Hollywood. Below ""When in Hollywood, visit Universal Studios"", it says ""Ask For Babs."" The same appeared in National Lampoon\'s Animal House (1978) (Babs is the Animal House character Babs Jensen), and it reappeared in Blues Brothers 2000 (1998) underneath a new Universal Studios Hollywood logo at the end of that movie.', u'In the original script, the Illinois Nazis were trying to buy the orphanage, and set it up as their new headquarters.', u'Graffiti on the bridge, under which the Blues Brothers hide their car, during the show reads, ""John *heart* Deborah"". This is a reference to John Landis and his wife, Costume Designer Deborah Nadoolman. Nadoolman was also the Costume Designer for Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984), in which Dan Aykroyd played Weber, the Ticket Agent.', u""In the mall chase, the woman who throws up cake and screams, is deaf stuntwoman Kitty O'Neil."", u'The receipt stamped by the tax assessor clerk (Steven Spielberg) is #6829, dated August 9, 1979, and correctly reflects that five thousand dollars cash for St. Helen of the Blessed Shroud Orphanage was received from ""Jake & Elwood Blues"", with an address of 1060 West Addison, Chicago, Illinois. The receipt is signed ""R.J. Daley"", a reference to Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley, for whom the plaza, through which they drove (with the Pablo Picasso sculpture), was named.', u'The scene in which the band appears in a sauna, clad only in towels, is an allusion to the cover photo on the 1973 Blood Sweat & Tears music album ""No Sweat"", in which the band appears in a sauna in identical pose. Lou Marini and Tom Malone, two of the Blues Brothers Band members, were also in BST and appear in both sauna scenes.', u""Every time we see the window in Elwood's apartment a train goes past."", u'When Aretha Franklin is describing Jake and Elwood to Matt Murphy, she says ""They look like they\'re from the C.I.A., or something."" The Blues Brothers wardrobe of dark suits and sunglasses originated as Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi\'s costumes on a few Saturday Night Live (1975) episodes in which they played Secret Service Agents guarding Chevy Chase\'s President Gerald Ford. In those skits, they wore black suits and sunglasses.', u'The SCMODS (State County Municipal Offender Data System) Readout for Elwood is as follows: Blues, ElwoodIllinois License: B263-1655-2187Currently under suspensionWarrants Outstanding: Parking 116Moving Violations: 56 (Flashing) Arrest Driver. Impound Vehicle', u'In a scene restored to the DVD release, Elwood parks the Bluesmobile in a tiny Chicago Transit Authority storage shed underneath a bank of transformers for the CTA trains. Dan Aykroyd had written this as part of an elaborate scene showing the Bluesmobile being ""charged up"" by the transformers to explain how the car could perform its impossible stunts. John Landis discarded the complicated explanations, saying, ""It\'s just a magic car!""', u'The original trailer for the film, contains scenes that were not included in either the original release or the Extended Edition DVD. Among these is a scene where Curtis (Cab Calloway) asks the Brothers ""How are you gonna get five thousand dollars in eleven days without ripping off somebody?""', u""John Belushi's wife Judy Jacklin has a cameo as a waitress, in the scene where Jake and Elwood meet with Murph and The Magictones."", u""The interior for the Blues Brothers' concert was the Hollywood Palladium. Audience members were recruited through radio station promotion. The exterior was Chicago's South Shore Country Club, located at 7059 South Shore Dr., which was later purchased by the city, and reopened as the South Shore Cultural Center."", u'When Jake and Elwood are stuck in traffic, backed up by Nazi marchers, they ask a cop what is going on, and he tells them, ""Those bums won their court case, so they\'re marching today."" Elwood scoffs, ""Illinois Nazis"", and Jake agrees, ""I hate Illinois Nazis."" This is a reference to a mid 1970s incident, in which the National Socialist (abbreviated in German as ""Nazi"") Party of America planned a public demonstration in Skokie, Illinois (the population of Skokie was not only heavily Jewish, but also contained an unusually large number of Holocaust survivors). After the local governments provided various impediments to the Nazis\' march, they eventually took the matter to the Supreme Court, which led to a 1977 decision (National Socialist Party of America v. Village of Skokie) in favor of the Nazis\' First Amendment right to Freedom of Assembly. The group subsequently did hold several Nazi rallies, but in Chicago instead of Skokie.', u'The scene where Jake and Elwood are sneaking out of the concert into the tunnel, was actually filmed underneath Chicago in a defunct electric narrow-gauge railway system. The railroad was used to carry coal, and freight its ashes out of town. Later, one of the tunnels under a river was breached, and the tunnels flooded, filling most of the basements in downtown Chicago with riverwater.', u""Colleen Camp's Playboy Magazine poster, also featured in Apocalypse Now (1979), is hanging on the wall of Elwood's apartment."", u'Lobbying from the Italian-American community ensured that the line ""The Mafia\'s out there"" was re-dubbed to ""The Mob\'s out there"" when the film was shown on television.', u'While at the phone booth, Elwood asks Jake ""Who you gonna call?"" This same line became the tagline for Ghostbusters (1984), which Dan Aykroyd wrote, and in which he starred. Furthermore, the part of Peter Venkman was initially written with John Belushi in mind, though due to Belushi\'s untimely death, it went to Bill Murray instead.', u'In the original script, The Magictones were Mexican immigrants. Also, The Blues Brothers Band was scattered across three states. Among their new lives: Willie Hall, a.k.a. ""Too Big"", is a drug dealer, Steve Cropper, a.k.a. ""The Colonel"", is a pool shark-turned-Hutterite, and Donald Dunn, a.k.a. ""Duck"", and Lou Marini, a.k.a. ""Blue"", work in different parts of security.', u'When Jake Blues is being processed for release from prison, the guards tell the clerk that Blues is from the ""Maximum Wing, Block Nine"", a reference to a song recorded by the Blues Brothers called ""Riot in Cell Block #9.""', u'The ""\'woman on the cutting-room floor"" (Shirley Levine) in the credits, is the mother of John Landis.', u""Prospects for a successful release, did not look good. Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi had left Saturday Night Live (1975) at the end of the previous season, reducing their bankability. Belushi's fame had taken a further hit after the commercial and critical failure of 1941 (1979) at the end of the year."", u'The popularity of the film boosted the Ray-Ban Wayfarer, which was yet experiencing some renewed popularity, thanks to the rise of the ""New Music"" movement. From a few thousand sold through the mid 1970s, sales rose to eighteen thousand during 1981, partly because of the film, bringing the model out from the verge of withdrawal.', u'The record label President, who offers the Blues Brothers a recording contract, identifies himself as representing ""Clarion Records, the largest recording company on the eastern seaboard."" There actually was a Clarion Records, a budget label that was only in operation for a couple of years in the 1960s. However, it was owned by what had become, by the time of the movie, one of the largest American record companies: Atlantic Records, which in real life was not only a renowned blues, R&B, and soul label (home of many of the artists mentioned or featured in the movie), but which also released the Blues Brothers\' albums, including this film\'s soundtrack.', u'Jesuit priest Gerald Walling plays one of the prison guards, and is credited with the honorific ""SJ"" (for Society of Jesus).', u'The bridge, off which the Illinois Nazis drive, during the car chase, was in downtown Milwaukee, Wisconsin. It was a ramp as part of an interchange that had not been fully developed. Later, that ramp was torn down and replaced.', u'DIRECTOR TRADEMARK (John Landis): (See You Next Wednesday): A billboard advertising the fictional horror movie ""See You Next Wednesday"" is seen during the Good Ole Boys chase.', u'In the original film, Elwood (Dan Aykroyd) never removes his sunglasses (the Extended Edition DVD features a scene where he is wearing safety glasses instead). Jake (John Belushi) only removes them once in either version.', u""Frank Oz has a bit part as the corrections officer who returns Jake's belongings in the opening scene."", u'In the public restroom where the Good Ole Boys\' front man discovers the graffiti, and advertisement for the Blues Brothers\' show at the Palace Hotel, the name ""Rick Baker"" can be seen written in red to the right of the illustration of Jake and Elwood. Baker was the Special Make-up Effects Artist for John Landis\' first feature film, Schlock (1973). Following the Blues Brothers, Landis called on Baker\'s talents once again for An American Werewolf in London (1981) and Michael Jackson\'s long-form music video Michael Jackson: Thriller (1983).', u""When John Belushi wasn't on-set, he went everywhere in Chicago. When he did, everybody was slipping him vials and packets of coke. That was in addition to what he could procure, or have procured, for himself, often consumed in his trailer, or at the private bar on-set he had built for himself, his longtime friends, the cast, and any visiting celebrities. Carrie Fisher, who John Landis had warned to keep Belushi away from drugs if she could, said almost everyone who had a job there also dealt, and the patrons could (and did) score almost anything there."", u'In the original script, the band took over a house in a developing neighborhood for rehearsal. To avoid the owners, Elwood detonates the house with cans of hairspray.', u'All the people in the concert, were fans of the Blues Brothers, and had volunteered for a free concert, and were promised one hundred thousand dollars in cash.', u""Cab Calloway's basement room and Ray Charles' music store, framed photos of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Malcolm X, John F.

The place was famous for its rowdy fights. It has been closed for many years now."", u'Universal kept trying to get the filmmakers to replace the blues and soul stars with more contemporary, successful acts like Rose Royce. John Landis stuck to his guns, but because he did, some large theater chains refused to book it into theaters in white neighborhoods.', u'Several residents of Harvey tried to sue John Landis for seventy-five thousand dollars, for failing to make good on promises of reopening the Dixie Square Mall, which he never made. The suit was thrown out of court.', u'John Candy orders three orange whips. This line was not scripted; Candy just improvised. While also a cocktail, Orange Whip provided refreshments for the crew, and Costumer Sue Dugan was daughter of the Director of Sales for Orange Whip, Kenny Dugan, who asked the brand be mentioned in the film.', u'Just before the Good Ol\' Boys\' RV drives into the river, it passes by a building whose sign reads, ""Mister Bill\'s Barbecue,"" referring to the popular Saturday Night Live (1975) short.', u'The Blues Brothers recorded and filmed Johnny Horton\'s song ""Sink the Bismarck"" for the gig at Bob\'s Country Bunker. When it was decided not to use the song, the footage disappeared, and remains lost.', u'The limousine, seen outside the Chez Paul, belonged to the owner of the restaurant. He almost had a heart attack when the stunt driver smashed through a letter box on his first attempt at parking.', u'Legend has it that, as a gag, Dan Aykroyd actually dressed up his first draft to look like a phone book when he turned it in.', u'In the new DVD version of the film, there are several added scenes. Elwood appears in one (sans sunglasses) to tell his boss that he needs to quit, because he wishes to become a priest.', u'The ""Palace Hotel Ballroom"", where the band performs its climactic concert, was at the time of filming a country club, but later became the South Shore Cultural Center, named after the Chicago neighborhood where it is located. The interior concert scenes were filmed in the Hollywood Palladium.', u'Principal photography on this film was completed February 1980 after six months.', u""One one occasion, John Landis went in to John Belushi's trailer and found a gigantic pile of coke on a table inside, which he flushed down the toilet. Belushi attacked him when he came back, Landis knocked him down with a single punch and Belushi collapsed into tears (Landis denies this ever happened)."", u'Over five hundred extras were used for the next-to-last scene, the blockade of the building at Daley Center, including two hundred National Guardsmen, one state and city police officers, with fifteen horses for the mounted police (and three Sherman tanks, three helicopters, and three fire engines).', u'Visual gag: The police radio in the Bluesmobile has an Atlantic Records logo.', u'In the basement of the orphanage, Elwood reminisces about his youth, thanking Curtis for ""singin\' Elmore James tunes, and blowin\' the harp for us down here"". The song playing at the time is ""Shake Your Moneymaker"", by Elmore James.', u'Dixie Square Shopping Center was used to film the shopping center sequence. Merchandise was purchased wholesale to stock shelves and whatever was not destroyed was returned. The sequence involved three hundred collisions, involving one hundred twenty cars, of which sixty vehicles were destroyed.', u'At the Bob\'s Country Bunker gig, Jake introduces ""Stand By Your Man"" by saying it\'s a favorite of the horn section. The horn section doesn\'t play in the song.', u'The grammar school where they stole the speaker from was Oscar F. Mayer (yes, from the meat company).', u'The boat going under the bridge that Jake and Elwood jump at the beginning of the film is the W.W. Holloway. She was originally launched in 1906, laid up on Dec 7, 1981 and scrapped in 1986. In the movie, she is wearing the paint scheme of Oglebay-Norton, the last shipping company to operate her.', u'At their concert, Elwood Blues (Dan Aykroyd) uses a Shure 520DX ""Green Bullet"" blues harp microphone.', u'The original budget was quickly surpassed, and back in Los Angeles Lew Wasserman grew increasingly frustrated. He was regularly confronting Ned Tanen, the executive in charge of production for Universal, in person over the costs. Sean Daniel, another studio executive, was not reassured when he came to Chicago and saw that the production had set up a special facility for the seventy cars used in the chase sequences. Filming there, which was supposed to have concluded in the middle of September, continued into late October.', u""Right before shooting the final scene, which required him to do all sorts of on-stage acrobatics, while performing at the Hollywood Palladium in front of an audience of hundreds of extras, John Belushi tried out some kid's skateboard, and fell off and seriously injured his knee. Lew Wasserman, the head of Universal Pictures, called the top orthopedist in Los Angeles, and made him postpone his weekend until he could shoot Belushi up with enough anesthetics to get him through filming."", u""Curtis is an homage to Curtis Salgado, a Portland, Oregon, blues musician, who inspired John Belushi, while he was in Oregon filming National Lampoon's Animal House (1978)."", u'DIRECTOR_CAMEO(John Landis): The state trooper driving the second car, the one that shows up after the first car calls for back-up, that chases the Bluesmobile through the shopping mall.', u'When the Bluesmobile crashes through the widow of the record store, we see a cardboard cut out of Robin Williams when he was promoting his new album ""Reality...What a Concept!"" He was also the last famous actor that John Belushi talked to on March 5, 1982, the night of his speedball tragedy.', u'The choice of Marquette Park as the location where Elwood drives the Bluesmobile across a lagoon bridge, disrupting the Nazi demonstration, with the iconic line ""I hate Illinois Nazis"", is no accident. The National Socialist Party of America, led by Frank Collin, marched at Marquette Park on July 9, 1978. Incidentally, a documentary film about this incident, Marquette Park II (1978), contains about five seconds of footage of a young Rahm Emanuel, elected mayor of Chicago on May 16, 2011, protesting against the Nazi march.', u'The ""Illinois Nazis"" use Ford vehicles (a 1975 Ford LTD Wagon and a 1977 Ford Pinto Wagon). Henry Ford, who formed the Ford Motor Company, was rumored to be a Nazi sympathizer before World War II.', u'The motor home driven by The Good Ole Boys is referred to as a ""Winnebago"". However, it is a Southwind, approximately a 1978 model, manufactured by Fleetwood. Winnebago is a manufacturer of motor homes, but has nothing to do with the Southwind company.', u'Carrie Fisher\'s shop is the ""Curl Up and Dye"".', u'When riding up the elevator at the courthouse, near the end of the movie, to the eleventh floor, the camera shows the buttons. They go eleven then thirteen, whereas many buildings do not have a thirteenth floor.', u'Elwood\'s license number, B263-1655-2187, unfortunately isn\'t for someone by the name of Elwood Blues. By dissecting the license number, you can find out information about the holder. Birthdate: July 1, 1952 (Dan Aykroyd\'s birthday). Gender: Male. First Initial: D. Middle Initial: E. Last Name: Starts with a B, followed by a guttural or sibilant (C, G, J, K, Q, S, X, or Z), followed by a short liquid (R), followed by a dental (D or T). The driver\'s license number turns out to be what Dan Aykroyd\'s license number would be, if he had obtained an Illinois license, simply substituting the leading ""A"" with the ""B"" for ""Blues""; thus the number shown in the film is a ""hybrid"", and is an invalid Illinois number. The book ""Blues Brothers: Private"" by Judith Jacklin (Judith Belushi-Pisano) gives Elwood\'s birthday as December 6, 1953. Therefore, Elwood\'s driver\'s license number should have been B420-2105-3347.', u'DIRECTOR_TRADEMARK(John Landis): [Ipanema]: The music in the elevator.', u""Bob's Country Bunker was a set built for the film on the backlot of Universal Studios. It stood for a while after filming was done, and was visible on the backlot tour, but was then torn down.

He had one hundred sixteen outstanding warrants for parking, and fifty-six for moving violations. This can be seen when Trooper Mount and Trooper Daniel ran his driver's license history, when he was first pulled over."", u""The Howard Johnson's scene in the film, is the real-life O'Hare oasis, located on the Illinois Tollway, the oases are, in real-life, tollway service plazas."", u'The premise of the underlying plot was somewhat unrealistic. It would be unlikely that a church-owned orphanage would have to pay a property tax bill since, in Illinois, as in much of the rest of the world, property owned by religious groups and other not-for-profit organizations is tax exempt. However, while the script was being written, a legislative proposal to tax such property was under consideration.', u'The first cut of the film lasted two and a half hours, with an intermission. After one early screening, Lew Wasserman demanded it be shortened, and seventeen minutes were cut.', u'The speaker that Elwood and Jake tie to the roof of the Bluesmobile is a Canadian CLM model 927290P air raid siren.', u""Jake's jilted fianc\xe9e was originally supposed to be blonde."", u'The production used six Ford Pintos, of which four were wrecked, as well as twelve specially outfitted Bluesmobiles. Before the Pinto could be dropped fourteen hundred feet (one hundred twenty stories) in downtown Chicago, Illinois, filmmakers had to test drop two Pintos, as required by Chicago officials, and the F.A.A.', u'On all DVD and Blu-ray releases, the credits end differently than originally shown. Universal\'s late 70s and early 80s ""Produced at Universal Studios, California USA"" card is shown, followed by the ""Ask for Babs"" shot. Once the ""Ask for Babs"" shot fades out, the song ends, and so does the movie. In the original 1980 theater and VHS versions, an MPAA R-rating card comes before the Universal logo and Ask for Babs shot. The song ends once the Ask for Babs shot fades out, but the audience is heard cheering and rooting loudly over a black screen for thirty seconds before the movie officially ends. The DVD and Blu-ray releases edit out the end cheering.', u'Twiggy had a cameo, in which she made a call at a pay phone outside the West Wind Motel on Roosevelt Road in West Chicago, Illinois. The pay phone has since been removed.', u'While the band mixed its 1978 album ""Briefcase Full of Blues"", a live recording of the aforementioned concerts, John Belushi, Dan Aykroyd, and Manager Bernie Brillstein outlined the concept of the movie to Universal Studio Executive Sean Daniel in a telephone call. Based on the popularity of Animal House (1978) and Saturday Night Live (1975), Daniel offered the duo a movie deal. By March 1979, Aykroyd had written a three hundred twenty-four-page screenplay titled ""The Return of the Blues Brothers"", but when John Landis came on board in Spring 1979, after dropping out of Universal\'s The Incredible Shrinking Woman (1981), he helped streamline the script to a workable length.', u'The dive hotel, to which Elwood and Jake went, looks just like the hotel room that Kirk Douglas was in, when he was running from the bad guys in The Fury (1978).

Eventually, Quint would be discovered sitting by himself. Spielberg says that the only thing that stopped him from doing that scene was Gregory Peck, who held part of the rights to that movie.

The producers said that they were not making Moby Dick (1956) and they would not work with someone who did not know the difference between a whale and a shark.', u'Although director Steven Spielberg wanted Charlton Heston to play Brody, the main reason he decided against casting Heston was because of his ""saving the day"" role in his previous movies, Airport 1975 (1974) and Earthquake (1974).

Because the Great White sharks they filmed would be smaller than the mechanical shark in the movie, they constructed a smaller version of Hooper's shark cage. Inside the cage they alternately used a small mannequin or a little person. One of the sharks they attracted got caught in the cage's cables and tore it apart trying to escape.

Spielberg believed that the swell of the boats would help indicate the huge size of the shark; however, the logistics involved (for example, getting all the boats to go up and down at the correct intervals) proved too difficult to coordinate properly.

Marvin thanked him but replied that he would rather go fishing. Spielberg then wanted Sterling Hayden for the role of Quint. Hayden, however, was in trouble with the Internal Revenue Service for unpaid tax. All of Hayden's income from acting was subject to a levy by the IRS, so there was an attempt to circumvent that; Hayden was also a writer, so one idea was to pay him union scale for his acting and buy a story from him (his literary income was not subject to levy) for a large sum.

He wanted to isolate the audience as much as the characters."", u""After the shark blows up, the groaning sound effects during the shot of the carcass sinking are the same ones the truck makes as it crashes off a cliff in Steven Spielberg's first film, Duel (1971). The sound effect is from the original Creature from the Black Lagoon (1954)."", u'In the original novel, Hooper has an affair with Brody\'s wife, and is killed by the shark in the cage at the end. However, because the relationship between Brody\'s wife and Hooper was considered by many to be irrelevant to the plot, and arbitrarily included in the novel just to ""sex it up"", it was omitted from the film script, and Hooper was allowed to survive.', u""The original scene of Alex Kintner's death called for a doll of Alex to be floating among the bathers, then the shark would jump out of the water and grab the doll and raft in its mouth. But as was typical of the mechanical shark, it didn't function properly. It would either come out of the water too high, not high enough or totally miss the raft. Finally, the shark succeeded in grabbing the raft, and in doing so, rolled over on its side, much like a real shark would do. This is the take Spielberg decided to use. However, the producers were concerned that the image of the shark with Alex in its mouth was too disturbing and might jeopardize the film's PG rating. Therefore, Spielberg and editor Verna Fields trimmed the beginning of the shot so only the shark's fins are briefly seen as it flips over."", u'The shark has 4 minutes of screen time.', u'Body Count: eight (five people, one dog, and two sharks)', u""The story that Quint tells about his experiences aboard a sinking cruiser is a fictionalized version of the actual World War II Portland-class cruiser USS Indianapolis. Of the 1,196 crewman aboard only 316 survived while 300 died during the sinking and the other 579 dying from exposure, dehydration, drinking salt water and some from shark attacks. The majority of the dialogue in the film was largely written by Robert Shaw. The most major difference between Quint's account and the actual event was the date of the sinking (mentioned in the film as June 29, 1945), while the ship was actually sunk over a month later on July 30."", u'According to Carl Gottlieb\'s ""The Jaws Log"", Steven Spielberg was never happy with the moment when Ben Gardner\'s head appears in the hole in the bottom of his boat. Preview audiences jumped at this scene, but Spielberg wanted more than an ordinary shock moment. However, the studio was unwilling to budget a re-shoot. So Spielberg declared that he\'d pay for it himself, assembling a crew in editor Verna Fields\' back-yard swimming pool, which would serve as the underwater location. A gallon of milk gave the water enough of the look of Nantucket Sound. The boat bottom was placed in the pool and Richard Dreyfuss\' stunt double went through the action. The studio eventually ate the cost of the re-shoot, and the scene was taken to a much higher level, just by changing the composition and timing of a few feet of footage.', u""When the shark is destroying the cage after Hooper swims away, you can see the shark turn and twist upside down. This was actual footage shot by Ron Taylor. As seen and explained in a recent Jaws (1975) documentary, the Great White Shark the couple had been filming became entangled in the cage's suspension ropes. The cage broke loose and sank to the bottom, however the shark managed to escape and swim off (as can also be seen in the film). After the shark had cleared the area, Ron had to take a second cage to the bottom in order to rescue the first. Ron and Valerie Taylor eventually went on to develop the chain-mail shark-proof diving suit."", u'In the book, it is revealed that Mayor Larry Vaughan is being blackmailed by the Mafia to keep the beaches open. The Mob has invested in Amity real estate, and is hoping for a multi-million dollar sale.', u'The sound-effect used when the shark first reveals itself, as Brody is throwing chum, is actually a fizzy-pop bottle being opened onto concrete after being shaken up. This sound effect was changed for the 25th DVD edition of the movie.', u""Regarding the ending, author Peter Benchley thought Steven Spielberg's idea of shooting and blowing up the compressed air tank was horrible. Spielberg even considered having Chief Brody kill the shark only to look up and observe several other fins coming towards him."", u'With this film being nominated for 4 Oscars at the 48th Academy Awards in which star Robert Shaw hosted, he became the first person to host the Oscars and die in a movie that was nominated in the same ceremony', u""This movie was rereleased in 2015 for its 40th anniversary.

The ending shown in theaters, as well as the 2012 Blu-Ray release, combines the original 1975 version and 2000 version. They combined the sound effect of the shark's death. In the original version, there was a ricochet sound when Brody shot the tank, which was removed in 2000.

It was then that I knew he could do anything."" Spielberg continued, ""I could have made \'The BFG\' with actors on oversized sets using a digital blend, but I wanted the giants to look beyond human.

While The BFG was originally going to be distributed through Touchstone, Disney decided to join production as a co-producer and co-financier, and switched the film to a Walt Disney Pictures release instead, citing on the original story's magic and heartwarming appeal. DreamWorks Pictures is not to be confused with the more well-known DreamWorks Animation; the two were formerly sister companies until they split in 2004 while retaining the rights to share the name and logo.

By combining the two, they\'re able to make decisions and frame and actually even cue actions based on what\'s happening in the virtual world."" This new process afforded director Spielberg the opportunity to film actors in performance capture suits acting on the same set with the film\'s human characters, and it was especially important to Spielberg that actress Ruby Barnhill and actor Mark Rylance have interaction with one another.', u'The movie\'s source novel ""The BFG"" is dedicated to the book\'s author Roald Dahl\'s late daughter, Olivia, who passed away due to measles encephalitis at the age seven in 1962, twenty years before the book was first published in 1982.', u'Two of the BFG\'s dream jars are labeled ""I is naked at work"" and ""I is naked at wedding"", respectively.', u'According to The New Yorker magazine: ""During principal photography, in Vancouver, in the spring of 2015, Melissa Mathison was on the set every day, handing cards to the director with the day\'s scene on it - a practice carried over from E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982) that encouraged Steven Spielberg to detach from the script in its entirety. ""Melissa was so inspirational for me on \'E.T.\' because she had this technique that I\'d never used before, and I\'ve only done it with Melissa,"" Spielberg says.

Rylance said ""A lot of what was created will never be seen by the audience. It was just there to encourage a sense of playfulness for us, and for Steven Spielberg as well.""', u'This movie was one of the most beautiful and curious experiences in his career according to the film\'s director Steven Spielberg. He explains: ""Curious because when I first walked onto the stages and I saw the different levels of complexity and the technology that was required to realize even a single shot, I was, for the first time since Jaws (1975), completely overwhelmed. I wasn\'t sure exactly how to pull it off, but I\'m so grateful for the artistry and generosity of the extraordinary people whose creativity, precision and spirit of invention made it possible.""', u'The source novel ""The BFG"" (1982) by Roald Dahl is an expanded version of one of Dahl\'s short stories from his earlier book ""Danny, the Champion of the World"" (1975).', u'At one point during the movie\'s long gestation and development, the late actor Robin Williams was touted to star as the BFG (the Big Friendly Giant).

It was also Roald Dahl\'s own favorite of all his stories. While the author passed away in 1990 at the age of 74, the producers forged a relationship with his widow and had many conversations about how important the book was to Dahl and whether or not a movie was even realistic. Producer Kathleen Kennedy said: ""We talked a lot about whether it would be better as animation or live action, because at the time, none of the technology that we were talking about using even existed.""', u'When Roald Dahl wrote ""The BFG"", he named the lead child character Sophie after his granddaughter, actress and model Sophie Dahl.

Spielberg continues: ""I have not had a chance to mourn Melissa, because she\'s been so vibrant and real to me, in the cutting room, on the scoring stage, in the dubbing room - she\'s just always been there with me, so because of that, it\'s going to be hard when I have to let The BFG go, because then I have to let Melissa go, too.""', u'According to the Wonderful World of Roald Dahl website, ""Gobblefunk"" can be defined as""Roald Dahl\'s own language"".

Artificial Intelligence (2001).', u'Steven Spielberg has been a fan of the film\'s source novelist Roald Dahl for years. In fact, Spielberg read ""The BFG"" (1982) children\'s novel to his own children when they were younger. Spielberg said: ""It\'s a story about friendship, it\'s a story about loyalty and protecting your friends and it\'s a story that shows that even a little girl can help a big giant solve his biggest problems."" Dahl created stories to tell his children and grandchildren, but was always hesitant to write any of them down, something with which the director could relate. Spielberg added: ""When I told my kids stories that they were especially fond of, they would beg me to make a movie about it. Fortunately, Dahl did eventually agree to share his stories with the world, and we\'re all the better because of it.""', u'According to director Steven Spielberg, he was raised on Grimm Fairytales, and they were very dark and very frightening with no redeeming social value, whatsoever. Spielberg said: ""They were almost object lessons for kids, but [Roald] Dahl and [Walt] Disney both subscribed to the precepts of children\'s folklore and embraced the darkness, because what is a fairy-tale without a dark center?

As a result, Carter and his co-production designer Rob Stromberg went to great lengths to accommodate three different worlds for three different-sized beings, in some cases duplicating sets three times over. There was a set for the 50-foot tall giants, for the 24-foot tall BFG, and a huge, over-scale set with big over-scale props for Sophie to make her look small. Fortunately, actor Mark Rylance had a tremendous amount of faith in the story and, actress Ruby Barnhill, a tremendous amount of faith in her imagination. Carter added: ""Between Mark\'s belief in story and how to perform the story, and Ruby\'s belief that everything is possible, both of those actors made this world of evolved technology disappear so that they could give each other the most authentic performances.""', u'The first Disney film directed by Steven Spielberg.

The height range of the giants in Giant Country ranged between twenty-four and fifty-two-feet with the BFG\'s brothers all standing between thirty-nine and fifty-two feet. The height of source novelist Roald Dahl at his peak stood six feet six inches-tall, Dahl being somewhat of a giant in real life himself. Moreover, publicity for The BFG (2016) declares that its lead actor Mark Rylance is ""a giant himself"". Another one of Dahl\'s stories which has been filmed is called James and the Giant Peach (1996).', u'Actress Penelope Wilton, who portrays The Queen, said of the Buckingham Palace Grand Ballroom set: ""It is an absolute replica of the actual ballroom with the same carpet and paintings that are in the palace itself.

But I think the number of historical movies that I\'ve been making - films like Lincoln (2012), Bridge of Spies (2015), and then going further back to films like Amistad (1997) and Schindler\'s List (1993) - have kept me fettered to the accuracy of telling a historical story. So being able to escape into the world of dreams and imaginations has been a dream in itself. That makes \'The BFG\' special, because it was my escape into what I think I kind of do best, which is just let my imagination run away with itself.""', u""The movie was made and released about twenty-seven years after the first filmed adaptation of Roald Dahl's source novel of the same name The BFG (1987)."", u""Due to several production companies and resulting territorial ownerships, one of Steven Spielberg's first movies to be distributed by independent companies in some major territories."", u'Alongside the traditional sets, sets the audience would see exactly as they were shot and lit, were the ""partially-real sets"".

The film was eventually shelved, but was later released as a book by Disney and Random House with all proceeds going to the Royal Air Force Benevolent Fund. The book did go on however, to serve as inspiration for the 1984 film Gremlins (1984), which, coincidentally, was produced by Steven Spielberg, director of The BFG (2016).', u'Included in the expansive traditional sets were the high ceilings and royal reds and golds of Buckingham Palace; the quaint Scandinavian home where Sophie and the BFG travel to deliver good dreams to a small boy and his family; the dark and forgotten orphanage on a cobblestone London street lined with small shops and gas street lamps; and the lonely interior of the dormitory where Sophie\'s adventure with the BFG begins. And these sets were all within footsteps of one another. Executive Producer Kristie Macosko Krieger said: ""It was like having access to your own little Disneyland.""', u'There was an extensive search and casting call conducted to cast the lead female role of Sophie which in the end was cast with actress Ruby Barnhill on 16th December 2014.', u""Director Steven Spielberg's first movie remake since War of the Worlds (2005).

It debuted in 1991 at the Wimbledon Theatre."", u'Producer Frank Marshall said: ""Roald Dahl\'s stories are not just happy-go-lucky fantasies. There\'s a lot of humor to them, but there\'s also a little bit of a dark side. He walks on the edge. They\'re a little scary, and I think that\'s what appeals to people."" Director Steven Spielberg added: ""It was very brave of him to introduce that combination of darkness and light, which was so much Walt Disney\'s original signature in a lot of his earlier works like Dumbo (1941), Fantasia (1940), Lumikki ja seitsem\xe4n k\xe4\xe4pi\xf6t\xe4 (1937), and Tuhkimo (1950).

In between set-ups, Spielberg could slip into one of two small tents on the stages where a dozen display screens fanned out. Here, the filmmaker could design, construct and re-frame his shots using the small handheld virtual camera.', u'Steven Spielberg has been a fan of Roald Dahl\'s for years, and in fact had read the book to his own children when they were younger. ""It\'s a story about friendship, it\'s a story about loyalty and protecting your friends and it\'s a story that shows that even a little girl can help a big giant solve his biggest problems,"" he says. Dahl created stories to tell his children and grandchildren, but was always hesitant to write any of them down, something with which the director could relate. ""When I told my kids stories that they were especially fond of, they would beg me to make a movie about it,"" Spielberg says. ""Fortunately Dahl did eventually agree to share his stories with the world, and we\'re all the better because of it.""', u'The movie is being released in a number of formats including standard 2D, Disney Digital 3-D, RealD 3D, and IMAX 3D.', u""The BFG (2016) is the third Steven Spielberg directed cinema movie to feature an acronym as or part of the title after A.I.

I can still remember being so frightened and terrified, but at the same time, so satisfied with that amazing ending.""', u'It was partially due to the extraordinary contributions of cinematographer Janusz Kaminski that the magic on screen looks as beautiful as it does. Kaminski was instrumental in lighting all the practical sets where the live-action scenes were shot and the virtual sets being used to shoot scenes with performance-capture technology so they were seamlessly integrated.', u'Though trailers state that the film is from both Disney and director Steven Spielberg, movie posters for the picture don\'t reflect this specific first time collaboration, and also specifically stating that the flick is a ""A Steven Spielberg film"" like many of his other movies, only that The BFG (2016) is from the creators of E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982), Matilda (1996), and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005), the latter two titles specifically referring to source novelist Roald Dahl.', u'According to director Steven Spielberg, he was raised on Grimm Fairytales, and they were very dark and very frightening with no redeeming social value, whatsoever. Spielberg said: ""They were almost object lessons for kids, but Roald Dahl and Walt Disney both subscribed to the precepts of children\'s folklore and embraced the darkness, because what is a fairy-tale without a dark center ? Without that dark center, where is the redemption, and how do you bring all of us out from the bowels of a nightmare into the most beautiful, enchanting dream we\'d ever seen?"".', u'According to Weta Digital\'s Joe Letteri, whose relationship with director Steven Spielberg dates back to Jurassic Park (1993) when he worked as a computer graphics artist, ""We wanted to allow Steven to be able to work as Steven, to utilize all the elements he brings to the process: his creative team, live action sets, lighting and costumes, while simultaneously creating a virtual world. For much of the film, Sophie is a little girl in this land of fantasy which is inhabited by giants, but we gave Steven the ability to shoot the movie as if the whole thing was live-action so as to bridge the gap between the virtual worlds and the digital worlds."" Previous films featuring performance-capture technology like Avatar (2009) or The Adventures of Tintin (2011) were shot on a very sparse set where the actors had to imagine their surroundings.', u'Executive Producer Kathleen Kennedy said: ""Steven Spielberg has always gravitated towards stories about families, which is one of the reasons his films have resonated with so many people. ""The BFG"" film and source novel is the story of the two lonely souls who, in finding one another, create their own home in the world, which is a consistent thread in Spielberg\'s rich body of work.', u'Young actress Ruby Barnhill learned six pages of dialogue in preparation for her audition for the lead female role of Sophie.', u'One of numerous and several collaborations of editor Michael Kahn and director Steven Spielberg.', u'The name of the cucumber like non-delectable vegetable that the vegetarian BFG ate was a vegetable called a ""Snozzcumber"".', u'According to Executive Producer Kristie Macosko Krieger, who previously collaborated with director Steven Spielberg on both Lincoln (2012) and Bridge of Spies (2015), ""the thing that was most important to Steven was that the actors believed where they were and that they could exclude from their peripheral vision everything going on around them.""', u'The environments created on the vast stages of the warehouse needed to do much more than solely accommodate the vastly different scales of the characters. Production Designer Rick Carter and his team worked especially hard to ensure that the environments in which the performances unfolded were as beautiful, frightening and rich as possible. Weta Digital\'s Joe Letteri explains: ""When [actor] Mark Rylance is on set and performing, he\'s performing in a facsimile of his real world, in his cave with his fireplace and table, his chair and the boat in which he sleeps.""', u'One of the roles of production design is to create environments and places that evoke something about, not only the story-line and the characters, but the themes of the film as well. As such, the production crafted worlds within worlds where director Steven Spielberg could create his vision for Roald Dahl\'s source story. Production Designer Rick Carter said: ""Steven started off with a very intimate process, just a computer and a few people in a room. And then we came to a big space and expanded it while still trying to keep it as intimate as possible.""', u'For Executive Producer Kathleen Kennedy, the sets conveyed a sense of timelessness, which was very much in synch with Roald Dahl\'s original story. Kennedy said: ""Dahl was telling a universal story, and, one of the key reasons that we built these sets is to give the film that slightly other worldly quality. You might recognize a street corner or a building or notice an architectural style that feel familiar, but you can\'t quite pinpoint it, and that\'s what allows you to escape into this kind of fairy-tale world.""', u'Production Designer Rick Carter said of the film\'s director Steven Spielberg: ""With The BFG, Steven is able to return to the innocence he had explored earlier in his career. He\'s a grandfather now . . . he\'s both the BFG and the innocent young person. But this is a story that taps into everybody\'s childhood experience of things that come out of the dark and what those things are about.""', u'Just as the filmmakers anticipated, screenwriter Melissa Mathison took a personal approach to the material, maintaining the relationship between the scrappy orphan and the word-jumbly giant as they took on their big adventure from Roald Dahl\'s source novel. Mathison said: ""My imagination was invested in the two of them. Everything needed to be centered on their relationship."" Director Steven Spielberg said: ""Melissa took Dahl\'s book and did the most extraordinary but faithful translation, with a magic only Melissa possesses.""', u""Both of the movie's writers, screenwriter Melissa Mathison and source novelist Roald Dahl, had passed away when the movie debuted in cinemas in 2016, Dahl in 1990 and Mathison towards the end of the production period of this film during late 2015."", u'Of the props and prop-work in the film, director Steven Spielberg said: ""There was so much love put into every prop. So much thought put into something as simple as the BFG\'s bag, which [production designer] Rick Carter created to resemble a big doctor\'s bag. Of course the bag carries his dreams, but the dreams are kind of like medicine for the kids who are in need of them, and the bag was stitched together in a Frankensteinian way to almost resemble a patchwork quilt.""', u'Producers Frank Marshall and Kathleen Kennedy were familiar with many of source author Roald Dahl\'s other books like ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,"" ""James and the Giant Peach"" and ""Matilda"" which have sold over 200 million copies worldwide, but neither had read ""The BFG.""

Abel was born in Newcastle-upon-Tyne to Russian parents and spent some of his early years in Scotland. He returned to Moscow in his late teens, but never lost his accent when speaking English."", u'Soviet agent Rudolf Ivanovich Abel received coded messages from his KGB handlers that were hidden inside a hollow U.S. nickel. The FBI first became aware of Abel\'s activities in 1953, when a Soviet agent mistakenly used one of the hollow nickels to buy a newspaper. The Brooklyn newsboy who got the nickel thought it felt too light. He dropped the nickel on the sidewalk, and it popped open, revealing a piece of microfilm with a coded message inside. FBI cryptologists were unable to crack the code until 1957, when a KGB defector, Reino H\xe4yh\xe4nen, gave them the key to deciphering the code, and gave up Rudolph Abel. The ""Hollow Nickel Case"" was also dramatized in The FBI Story (1959).', u'Director Steven Spielberg had a good laugh when he read the line in the screenplay of a policeman taunting Donovan that he had been in ""the third wave on Normandy."" Spielberg joked to Tom Hanks that he ought to answer: ""I was in the first"", a reference to Saving Private Ryan (1998), also directed by Spielberg.', u'For the scene outside the courtroom, the photographers were initially instructed to put their used flashbulbs, which are extremely hot to the touch, in their pockets. One of the background actors happened to be the historian of the New York Press Photographers Association. He told Executive Producer and 1st Assistant Director Adam Somner that, at the time, photographers would have ejected the bulbs onto the floor. After several takes, noticing the bulbs strewn across the floor, Steven Spielberg decided to shoot the low-angle view of the principals walking through them.', u'According to Steven Spielberg in a press release for the movie, Gregory Peck came after the story in 1965. Alec Guinness agreed to play Rudolf Ivanovich Abel, Peck would play James B. Donovan, and Stirling Silliphant would write the script. MGM declined to make the movie at the time. It was 1965, Cold War tensions were high, and MGM was reluctant to get into the politics of the story.', u'For six days of shooting on the Glienicke Bridge and surrounding streets, the production firm had to pay 10,552.13 EUR (about $11,428.96 U.S.) to the local district, the city of Potsdam, and the German government. It took one person five months to get the all the necessary permits from 23 different agencies.', u'Arnold Spielberg, the father of Steven Spielberg, actually went on a foreign exchange to Russia as an engineer during the cold war, right after Francis Gary Powers was shot down, when there was tremendous fear and hostility between the two nations. Arnold Spielberg recalled seeing Russian citizens line up to look at Powers\' crashed gear and ""see what America did."" When they saw the American engineers, they pointed at them and said, ""Look what your country is doing to us,"" demonstrating the fear and rage the nations felt towards each other.', u'In an interview with the International Spy Museum, the son of Francis Gary Powers, Francis Gary Powers, Jr., indicated that his father was not told to commit suicide if shot down, unlike the depiction in the movie. Instead, it was given as an option in case physical torture had been involved, allowing the pilots to use a poison pin if the pilots chose to commit suicide. He also indicated that the Soviets found the pin on a third strip search, but Powers warned them not to touch it. The Soviets tried the pin on a dog and the dog died a few moments later.', u'Principal photography on ""Bridge of Spies"" began in September 2014, and shot for twelve weeks on locations in Germany, Poland, and New York City, including many of the places where the events in the story took place. European production kicked off in Berlin where the prisoner exchange of Rudolf Ivanovich Abel and Francis Gary Powers took place. To film the crucial Berlin Wall sequences, production also traveled to Wroclaw, Poland, which more accurately resembles the East Berlin of 1961, than Berlin itself.', u'Tom Hanks was 59 when he played James B. Donovan in this movie. The real Donovan was in his 40s when the events of the film took place, and later passed away from a heart attack at age 53.', u'When James B. Donovan and CIA Agent Hoffman are in West Berlin, they walk past a German cinema where one of the movies playing is ""Eins, Zwei, Drei."" It\'s the German title of the American Cold War comedy One, Two, Three (1961), which was directed by Billy Wilder.

He was invited to meet Steven Spielberg, Tom Hanks, and actor Austin Stowell, the latter of whom plays his father Francis Gary Powers in the movie. He then introduced them to Joe Murphy, his father's co-pilot, who also helped identify him on the bridge, where the spy trade occurred."", u'The Russian phrase ""stoikiy muzhik"" literally translates to ""persistent peasant;"" ""stoikiy"" means persistent, rigid, or uncompromising, and ""muzhik"" is a slang term for peasant. Abel\'s translation of the phrase as ""standing man"" is appropriate on a metaphorical level.', u'Just before the U-2 takes off, its auxiliary landing gear falls off the right wing. The U-2 was designed to be as light as possible to give it maximum range and altitude capability. Its auxiliary landing gear, or ""pogos"", were designed to fall away from its wings on takeoff to minimize weight. The plane lands with its nose and tail gear in an inline ""bicycle"" configuration, and its wingtips are equipped with titanium skid plates to prevent damage.', u'At the beginning of the film, Rudolf Ivanovich Abel is painting a self-portrait, the scene is based on Norman Rockwell\'s ""Triple Self-portrait"". Steven Spielberg and George Lucas are both big collectors of Rockwell\'s work.', u'During the scene at dinner, James B. Donovan uses the line, ""Every man deserves a defense"". This line was also used in another Tom Hanks movie, The Green Mile (1999).', u'London-based playwright and television writer Matt Charman stumbled upon a footnote in a biography of John F. Kennedy that referenced an American lawyer who Kennedy had sent to Cuba to negotiate the release of 1,113 prisoners. Some quick research led to James Donovan, a successful insurance claims lawyer from Brooklyn. Several years earlier, Donovan had defended a Soviet agent accused of espionage during the Cold War. Even though he specialized in insurance law, and had not practiced criminal law for some time, he was asked to negotiate one of the most high-profile prisoner exchanges in history. With little knowledge of the inner-workings of the film industry, Charman flew to Hollywood in the hopes of convincing a studio to green-light a film based on Donovan\'s story. While Donovan\'s role was not well-known in the annals of Cold War history, Charman pitched to DreamWorks Pictures a gripping tale of an idealistic man navigating the world of national security and espionage. ""When I heard the story, it knocked my socks off,"" says producer Kristie Macosko Krieger, who was a co-producer on Steven Spielberg\'s Lincoln (2012), and is based at DreamWorks. Krieger said, ""Not many people know the story of James Donovan, and what he accomplished during this period of U.S. history, but it sounded like something that was right up Steven\'s alley.""', u'The subway Donovan rides home is the only remaining N.Y.C. Transit R11 subway car that was part of an order of ten built in 1949. It was called the ""million dollar train"" because each of the ten cars cost over $100,000. The interior in the film is from a 1964/65 rebuild of the car, not the one it had when the story took place in 1961.', u""This is the second collaboration between Steven Spielberg, Joel Coen and Ethan Coen.

According to Mark Rylance, ""We don\'t really know all that much about him, other than the fact that he received and passed on messages at various drop sites throughout New York City using a hollow coin. He was, what you call, a sleeper spy. Abel had been in the United States for several years before he began these clandestine activities, and he wasn\'t the chief organizer of the spy-ring, he just carried out the mission. But when he was caught, the U.S. government made him out to be a little more important than he actually was.""', u'The car used by the East German negotiator is a Volvo P1800 early production model, from 1961-1963 called the ""cow-horn"" bumper and similar to the one used by Roger Moore in The Saint (1962). Even the speedometer that is shown, is correct.', u'The French debut was scheduled for November 15, 2015. After several terrorist attacks hit Paris on November 13th, leaving more than 120 people dead, the premiere was cancelled.', u'In 1964, James B. Donovan wrote an account of the classic Cold War spy incident, of which this film is the subject. It was entitled: ""Strangers on a Bridge: The Case of Colonel Abel (Rudolf Ivanovich Abel) and Francis Gary Powers"".', u'The CIA offered crack fighter pilot Francis Gary Powers $30,000 a year ($265,758.43 in 2017 dollars) to fly its top-secret bird.', u'The movie was filmed under the working title of ""St. James Place"".', u'The crash of Francis Gary Powers\'s U-2 spy plane was shot via a large screen at Flughafen Tempelhof Airport, where production designer Adam Stockhausen and his team built a replica of the U-2\'s cockpit on a motion base which was used for all the close-ups of Powers in his aircraft. According to producer Kristie Macosko Krieger, ""it was amazing to be able to shoot with these old airplanes at beautiful locations like Tempelhof where the events in the story actually took place . . . you can\'t re-create stuff like that.""', u'When lawyer James B. Donovan and CIA Agent Hoffman meet over breakfast to discuss including Frederic L. Pryor in the prisoner swap, an instrumental version of Nat \'King\' Cole\'s ""Unforgettable"" plays in the background. Donovan is try to convince Hoffman that Pryor should not be forgotten.', u'The film cast includes two Oscar winners: Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance ; and two Oscar nominees: Alan Alda and Amy Ryan.', u'Co-screenwriters, Joel Coen and Ethan Coen, immediately dove in after Matt Charman\'s first couple of screenplay drafts, immersing themselves in the language of the period and incorporating Tom Hanks\' persona into the character of James Donovan, expertly interweaving this remarkable experience in his life into a powerful story that captured the essence of the man. Steven Spielberg said: ""Joel and Ethan got us very, very deep into the characters. They really instilled a sense of irony and a little bit of absurd humor, not absurd in the sense that movies can take license and be absurd, but that real life is absurd. They are great observers of real life, as we all know from their great august body of work, and were able to bring that to the story."" One theme woven throughout the texture and framework of the Coen Brothers\' screenplay, which struck a chord with Spielberg, was the notion that spies looked like everyone else. Spielberg explained: ""It wasn\'t just shadows and light and spies in a stereotypical way, but it was spies as people that we wouldn\'t even think twice about, we wouldn\'t even notice them to begin with, let alone figure out that they\'re here to do a mission against our national security. Between Matt Charman and Joel (Coen) and Ethan Coen, I was in the hands of three wonderful storytellers.""', u'Costume Designer Kasia Walicka-Maimone\'s research showed that, for the most part, people dressed up in the late 1950s and 1960s. She said: ""Men and women were more formally-attired, meaning suits and hats for men and dresses, suits and skirts for women. But the men\'s suits were not at all like those worn today. They were constructed in another manner, an older tradition, with a different body shape, a different sleeve, a different fit to the trousers and a thicker weave in the fabric.""', u'The movie was partially filmed at Beale Air Force Base in California.', u'Finding a place to shoot the train scene in contemporary Berlin, Germany had initially presented a challenge for the filmmakers, as the Friedrichstrasse Station standing today is more modern than the one that existed during the Cold War. But Adam Stockhausen came up with a solution, and re-created the station using a hulking, rusty overpass of S-Bahn tracks near another S-Bahn station that ran along a crumbling brick wall.', u'27th theatrical film directed by Steven Spielberg.', u'To film crucial scenes in the story which took place at the Berlin Wall, the production moved to Wroclaw, Poland. Wroclaw (pronounced Vrotzwuav) was in a state of disrepair, the result of economic hardship and years of neglect, but similar in look to that of a city ravaged by war. The city had been part of Germany, before the borders were redrawn, and was called Breslau at the time, so all the architecture was German in style. According to producer Marc Platt, ""many of the buildings had not been touched since the war. . . There were literally bullet holes in some of the buildings.""', u'Steven Spielberg said of regular collaborator John Williams not being able to score this movie: ""It was devastating to me, because John was having this medical thing, and he\'s okay now, thank God, but we have always worked together, and after forty-two years of collaboration, not to work with him was almost incomprehensible. At one point, my response was not to have any music at all . . . it would just come out of record players and radios and those kinds of things. But then I knew that there were parts of this film that really would benefit from a score, and I didn\'t think twice when I knew it wasn\'t going to be John . . . the first person I thought of was Tom Newman.""', u'Steven Spielberg has often tackled seminal historical events throughout his career. A history enthusiast, his knowledge of the Cold War dates back to childhood, when his father told stories of the deep-seated feelings of animosity and distrust that existed between the U.S. and Soviet Union, stories he still remembers today. ""My father had gone to Russia, during the Cold War, on a foreign exchange, right after Francis Gary Powers was shot down,"" remembered Spielberg. ""My dad and three other associates from General Electric stood in line because they were putting Powers\' flight suit, helmet and the remains of the U-2 on display for everybody in Russia to see what America had done. He was about an hour away from the front of the line when a couple of Russian military officials approached my dad and asked for their passports, saw they were Americans, and got them to the head of the line, not to convenience them, because after they got to the head of the line, this Russian pointed to the U-2 and then pointed to my dad and his friends and said, \'Look what your country is doing to us,\' which he repeated angrily several times before handing back their passports."" ""I never forgot that story,"" he says, ""and because of that, I never forgot what happened to Francis Gary Powers.""', u'Based on the caliber of filmmakers already in place, Tom Hanks was inclined to come on board without even reading the script. Once he did, he knew it had the potential to become one of the most exciting projects in his career. Hanks said, ""This subject matter has always fascinated me, because of the area, and because of the time. I knew that Francis Gary Powers was a U-2 pilot who was shot down by the Soviet Union, that it was a huge international incident and that there was a trade that got him back, but I didn\'t know any of the details or who James Donovan was."" Hanks continued, ""I love reading history and finding out something brand new, particularly about a subject that I think I\'m well versed in, and when that happens, man, it\'s like winning the lottery.""', u""As of November 2015, this is (unadjusted for inflation) Steven Spielberg's lowest-grossing film since M\xfcnchen (2005) ."", u'Mark Rylance is the second of two actors to win an Academy Award for acting in a film by Steven Spielberg. The first was Daniel Day-Lewis for Lincoln (2012).', u'Producer Marc Platt, was familiar with James Donovan\'s story and was also aware of director Steven Spielberg\'s interest in the Cold War and history in general, and felt it was ideally suited for the director\'s sensibilities. Platt said: ""As a filmmaker, Steven has studied some great iconic characters and can re-create history in an extraordinarily cinematic way. He\'s the perfect filmmaker to tell a story like this."" And they were both right. The story was part legal drama, part thriller and part historical epic, and Spielberg was riveted. But it was the character of James Donovan that he found most appealing. The story of a well-respected lawyer living the life of a typical family man in the \'50s who took on a dangerous assignment and prevailed through sheer instinct and conviction of principle, had enormous cinematic potential.', u'Scenes of James B. Donovan trying to talk his way past East German guards at the Friedrichstrasse Checkpoint, so he won\'t miss his appointment at the Soviet Embassy with Wolfgang Vogel, were filmed at Berlin\'s City Center. Friedrichstrasse, better known as Checkpoint Charlie, is the best-known border crossing point between East Berlin and West Berlin. ""Everyone assumes the only way into East Berlin was through Checkpoint Charlie, but that wasn\'t the case,"" production designer Adam Stockhausen pointed out. ""You could actually take the S-Bahn past the border and get off at the Friedrichstrasse Station, but when you got off you\'d still have to go through a checkpoint to enter the East.""', u'The end result on-screen conveys not only the terror of the Berlin Wall, but the confusion as well. Steven Spielberg said: ""The Berlin Wall was really symbolic, but it didn\'t look like San Quentin, or Alcatraz, or some other huge federal penitentiary. The walls were actually fairly easy to scale, you just didn\'t dare do it. When we shot those scenes, I looked at the Wall and thought to myself, \'Did this really happen? Was Berlin really divided like this?\' It brought back a time in my life when walls started to go up all over the world, most of them invisible walls, but walls nonetheless."" Tom Hanks added: ""It was terrifying, and it felt so permanent, too. What production designer Adam Stockhausen was able to do with the wall, finding that perfect crossroads in the city of Breslau in Poland that matched up so well to the architecture of the time, was truly amazing.""', u'After the Donovan household is shot up, a disgruntled police officer confronts James B. Donovan and says, ""I was in the third wave on Omaha Beach."" In Saving Private Ryan (1998), Tom Hanks\'s character landed on Omaha Beach.', u'The film was nominated for six Academy Award nominations including Best Picture, Best Achievement in Sound Mixing, Best Original Screenplay, Best Achievement in Production Design, and Best Achievement in Music Written for Motion Pictures - Original Score, and won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for Mark Rylance.', u""The historic Glienicke Bridge in Berlin, Germany, where the actual exchange of Rudolf Ivanovich Abel for Francis Gary Powers took place, was the setting of the story's historic climax. The Bridge spans the Havel River and is near Wannsee, where the Wannsee Conference with Adolf Eichmann and the other architects of the Holocaust took place (See: Conspiracy (2001), The Final Solution: The Wannsee Conference (1984), and The Wannsee Conference (1992)). During the war, the Glienicke Bridge separated East Berlin and West Berlin. At the time Bridge of Spies (2015) was made, it connects the Brandenburg section of Berlin to the suburb of Potsdam."", u'One incident in particular which stood out for the cast involved the inadvertent smashing on the ground of used flashbulbs from the press photographers. It was after the reading of Rudolf Ivanovich Abel\'s (Mark Rylance\'s) verdict in court, when the media were surging around James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks), his wife Mary Donovan (Amy Ryan), and Thomas Watters, Jr. (Alan Alda). Mark Rylance explained: ""Steven came up with the idea of using these discarded bulbs littering the floor as a way to heighten the drama when Mary, who\'s being overwhelmed by the media, steps back, and her high heel crunches one of the bulbs."" Amy Ryan added: ""Steven had this idea in an instant. I saw him get down onto the floor at the level of the camera so he could see exactly what the shot, the smashing of the bulbs, would look like. We learn a great deal about Mary, because of the way Steven filmed this scene, me included."" Tom Hanks added: ""It ends up making a comment on the waste. It wasn\'t even in the script, it wasn\'t even a cool shot, but it actually added to the tapestry of the moment, and Steven comes up with stuff like that because that\'s the way he thinks. Steven thinks in cinematic terms. His ability to tell important story moments just by what he does with the camera, is the reason he\'s Steven Spielberg. He\'s done it again and again and again, and all you can do is stand back and watch.""', u'Steven Spielberg had been very much interested in directing a James Bond spy film in his earlier years, and did have talks with then Bond franchise producer Albert R. Broccoli about directing For Your Eyes Only (1981), but Broccoli told him he only wanted British directors to helm the Bond series. Shortly afterwards, George Lucas offered Spielberg an iconic hero of his own, in the form of Indiana Jones and Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981).', u""Tom Hanks' character James B. Donovan makes a clumsy, but valiant attempt to speak German. In reality, Hanks has some German ancestry on his father's side of the family."", u'Steven Spielberg said: ""As a youngster growing up in the 50s and 60s, I had a tremendous amount of awareness of what was happening during the Cold War, but I didn\'t know anything about the exchange of Rudolf Ivanovich Abel for Francis Gary Powers. I knew about Powers, because, growing up, everyone had heard that his U-2 spy plane had been shot down, and that he had been put on public display at a very public trial, but the story kind of ended with a spectacular shoot down. I didn\'t realize that something had happened subsequent to his capture, which was this very backroom exchange, this spy swap between Abel, a Soviet spy, and Powers, the American spy pilot. So there was a lot to this story that really pulled me in.""', u'Steven Spielberg was clear with Thomas Newman, in that he was not expecting him to deliver a John Williams score. Newman said: ""Steven has a very fundamental, almost primal, relationship with John Williams, and a very successful one at that, but he encouraged me to write music that reflected my aesthetic as opposed to trying to match John\'s. I\'ve known John forever through my family, but I always knew I didn\'t want to end up being a third-rate John Williams, because his style has been such a defining part of what movie music is."" While John Williams was unavailable to score the film, due to a minor health issue, which was corrected, Williams did go on to write the score for Spielberg\'s next film, The BFG (2016).""', u'It was important for Steven Spielberg that James B. Donovan (played by Tom Hanks) remained the story\'s focus, and the fact that there was no music at the beginning of the film, helped to reinforce the story, and accentuate the dialogue. Editor Michael Kahn explained: ""By not having music there, it allowed us to really get a sense for what Donovan\'s life is like, and it worked out beautifully, because we got to know him quickly, because we were able to hear all the dialogue so clearly.""', u'The real Rudolf Ivanovich Abel was, in fact, a very-skilled artist, something Steven Spielberg chose to focus on in the film\'s opening scene. Spielberg explained: ""How we see ourselves and how other people see us, what we hide in order for others to discover something hidden . . . that was all part of this idea I had to start the film on Mark Rylance\'s face playing Rudolf Abel, then to pull back and discover that he\'s actually studying his face because he\'s doing a self-portrait."" Spielberg continued: ""It gave me a kind of stylistic theme to continue to think about, like how do we see ourselves . . . is that actually who we are when we paint what we look like, or is that our idea of somebody we want others to see, which is what spies do. They have to go into disguise, and blend in, and actually disappear, to be successful. I just thought that was a good way of starting the story on the right thematic note.""', u'The U-2 spy plane was nicknamed ""The Dragon Lady"".', u'Reunites Tom Hanks and Peter McRobbie after their appearance in Big (1988).', u""John Williams returned to score Steven Spielberg's next film The BFG (2016).

This was the place where of several Cold War spy prisoner trades and exchanges between the U.S. and the Soviet Union occurred during the Cold War.', u'Alan Alda plays the role of Thomas Watters, Jr., who is a senior partner at the law firm where James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks) works. Alda said: ""My character sort of edges Donovan out of his job in order to protect the firm. Watters just wants to protect the firm and prevent Donovan from becoming too idealistic, which was a clever way for the screenwriters to show what Donovan was up against when he agreed to take the case.""', u'Portions of the Friedrichstrasse Checkpoint were re-created in Wroclaw, Poland by production designer Adam Stockhausen and his team as well, including its iconic sign in three languages which read, ""You Are Now Leaving the American Sector"". The set was used to film the climatic sequence where Frederic L. Pryor (Will Rogers) is being escorted to the Checkpoint by Wolfgang Vogel (Sebastian Koch), among others. Marc Platt said: ""Everything about the Checkpoint Charlie set was remarkable. You felt as though you were living in that moment in time, in history."" Tom Hanks added: ""These people do work that I can\'t even begin to fathom. It all just looks like homework to me, and they always seem to be just barely operating in time to get it all done. But when you see the end result and it is so evocative that even someone like me, who knows that it is a set, still lingers on it as long as possible, that is a special talent."" Mark Rylance agreed, saying, ""the sets were all incredibly beautiful with an amazing amount of detail. As an actor, we are working among craftspeople, and just being surrounded by these people with such skill and love for what they do, is very inspiring. It is the combination of all these crafts which make a great film, and Steven leads so creatively.""', u'James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks) believes that Rudolf Ivanovich Abel (Mark Rylance) was acting honorably, but when he comes across some technicalities in the search and seizure of Abel\'s art studio and apartment, he begins to question whether Abel received due process at the time of his arrest. Producer Marc Platt explained: ""This is basically a guy from the CIA who believes that the most important thing should always be protecting the security of the country, and Donovan has a different set of principles that have to do more with his take on the Constitution . . . sort of a constitutional viewpoint versus a national security viewpoint.""', u'During the Cold War, the need to gather strategic military information from our adversaries led to the development of the U-2 spy plane by the U.S. It was a reconnaissance aircraft that flew at heights of 70,000 feet, twice the altitude of a commercial jet while the aircraft was undetectable by Soviet radar.', u""In the scene in which Tom Hanks calls his wife from a pay phone in West Berlin, one of the films shown on the marquee is Spartacus. Spartacus and Exodus were the first films to acknowledge Dalton Trumbo as screenwriter since he was blacklisted in 1947 after testifying before HUAAC. While historically accurate that Spartacus would have been released around the same time as James Donovan's negotiations in Berlin, the inclusion of the film on the marquee is a subtle nod toward the Hollywood blacklist, and American anti-communist efforts in Hollywood."", u'Fletcher Prouty, an Intelligence Community insider, has said that President Eisenhower was planning on going to Russia for peace talks, the CIA gave the Russians inside information on the U2 so the Russians could shoot it down and ruin the talks.

The project was eventually cancelled.', u'Tom Hanks was fascinated by the strong bond that develops between his character James B. Donovan and Russian spy Rudolf Ivanovich Abel. Hanks explains: ""What he developed with Rudolf Abel was, first, a very completely professional relationship as an advocate. He even says, \'I am your advocate, my job is to represent you, and bring you the best version of American justice that I can surmise, and here\'s what I think that justice needs to be,\' and he was dogged in his pursuit of that. He also developed a great personal relationship with Abel because he felt as though he was fighting for a good guy, both personally and in terms of what he stood for.""', u'The nickname of the Glienicke Bridge in Berlin in Germany is ""The Bridge of Spies"".', u'The movie was released on the thirtieth anniversary of the romantic cold war thriller White Nights (1985). One person, George Doering, is billed for both movies, both as a musician in the music department, credited as a musician for White Nights (1985) and an instrumental soloist for Bridge of Spies (2015). Both pictures also both won an Academy Award, but in different categories, Best Song for White Nights (1985) and Best Supporting Actor for Mark Rylance, for Bridge of Spies (2015).', u'Adam Stockhausen explained the film\'s production design: ""We had to work fast in \'blitz-style,\' which meant swapping out posters and signage, changing lighting fixtures and redressing everything from top to bottom. And then, of course, everything had to be put back in place as quickly as possible.""', u'Interior subway shots were filmed in actual subway cars, from the 1960s, housed at the New York City Transit Museum.', u'Interiors of the Donovan house, and additional set pieces, were built on sound-stages at Steiner Studios in Brooklyn, New York. Kristie Macosko Krieger said: ""When I stepped onto the set of Donovan\'s home for the very first time, it was like I had gone back in time to the late 50s and I was having dinner with someone\'s family. Adam Stockhausen got every little detail perfect in that house.""', u'The characters of James B. Donovan and Wolfgang Vogel share their last names with villains in an earlier Steven Spielberg film, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989).', u'As a child, the 8mm war movies Steven Spielberg made in his backyard, were often set in World War II, a recurring subject in numerous films he would one day direct. Titles ranging from Schindler\'s List (1993), Saving Private Ryan (1998), and Empire of the Sun (1987), to 1941 (1979) and the ""Indiana Jones"" films, but until now, none were set in the world of international espionage. ""I love spy movies,"" said Spielberg. ""I love John le Carr\xe9, the James Bond movies, Mad Magazine and the infamous \'Spy vs. Spy\' column that I grew up with, so spying has always been on my mind.""', u'With this film, the characters truly are the story, and James B. Donovan, an insurance lawyer who is lured into the powerful corridors of the FBI and CIA, is the heart of the story. When it came to casting the crucial role, the choice had always been obvious: one of the most iconic actors working at the time, Tom Hanks. Kristie Macosko Krieger said: ""There is no one better suited for this role than Tom Hanks. James Donovan is just an ordinary guy . . . he is like my best friend\'s dad. He was a guy who did his job and then gets thrown into this incredible international story. That just doesn\'t happen, but people think of Tom Hanks as everyman, and that\'s why he is so brilliant as James Donovan.""', u'Steven Spielberg, James B. Donovan represents the ideals of a genuinely altruistic person, someone who had the tenacity to put Rudolf Ivanovich Abel\'s defense ahead of his own comfort and safety because he truly believed that the law needed to be respected. Spielberg said: ""It brought a lot of tension to Donovan\'s family, the same kind of tension that I imagine my own dad went through when he told people he spent three weeks in the Soviet Union at a time when if you even mentioned the Soviet Union in the wrong way, you could be accused of complicity.""', u'In Brooklyn, where Rudolf Ivanovich Abel had created a simple existence for himself as a painter, Abel is captured, and doesn\'t try to hide his past. He remains tight-lipped and reveals no information about his activities in the U.S. or connections to anyone in Moscow, frustrating the FBI to no end. Says Tom Hanks: ""Abel was just a guy doing his job. He\'s a spy, and we have guys over there doing the same thing for our country. I believe that Abel was surprised to hear this argument from a man who was his advocate . . . it was not just some sort of legalistic ploy on his part, it was what he believed. It was an irrefutable fact, and that played itself out through the relationship.""', u'According to Steven Spielberg, some of the best moments in his films are accidents, either accidents of interpretation or something audiences read into, on their own. He said: ""Other times they are determined choices for which I cross my fingers that people will discover as they watch the movie, and that\'s the most satisfying thing: when you intend something and people understand what your intention was, and they\'re getting it, and they\'re liking what they\'re getting. That\'s the best reward.""', u'Rudolf Ivanovich Abel states his wife is a musician. Mark Rylance, who plays Abel, has a wife who is also a musician.', u'In the early scene of the Donovan family eating dinner together, a dish of peas and carrots is clearly visible in the same shot as James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks). ""Like peas and carrots"" is a favorite catchphrase of Hanks\' title character in Forrest Gump (1994).', u'Back in 1962, Roger Corman hired Robert Towne to write a quick screenplay based on the Francis Gary Powers incident. However, ""I Flew a Spy Plane Over Russia"" never got to be filmed.', u'Sometimes truth is stranger than fiction, and with ""this film, the incredible story of an ordinary man placed in extraordinary circumstances, it is all the more compelling because the character at the heart of the story is a real person. Because of his association with Rudolf Ivanovich Abel, James B. Donovan was subjected to a great deal of scrutiny from the media and the general public, and a source of fascination in the story for director Steven Spielberg is the notion that people often jump to conclusions and make snap judgments, which ended up helping him determine the best way to approach the story. Spielberg explained: ""We have to find the villain and find the hero in real-life stories, and so by quickly targeting and earmarking a villain, we immediately stop being mindful, or even empathetic, about the person that we deem a villain. We give all our empathy to the hero, and we give no credit and no currency to the villain. By doing that, we become very one-sided and all our tolerance goes out the window."" Spielberg continued: ""One of the things I loved about this story was that everyone you think should be wearing a black hat isn\'t necessarily wearing that hat, nor did they intend to. It doesn\'t make it easy to root for someone who is a spy against the national security of our nation . . . how could we possibly come out on the other end of this experience caring about this person in the least? But in this case we do, and that was something that made me want to get involved with the project.""', u""Abel's real name was William August Fisher. His real name was used in all court proceedings and later. The film used Abel throughout as he was known to the American public by that name."", u'Mark Rylance had nothing but praise for Tom Hanks. Rylance said: ""Tom saw me in \'Twelfth Night\' in Los Angeles in 2003 before the production was famous, and he was one of the first actors to come to it, and to come backstage afterward and talk to the cast, which was very exciting for everyone. But what surprised me the most about Tom, is that he loves to make people laugh and has this very goofy sense of humor, which immediately puts people at ease.""', u'Before filming began, Amy Ryan, who portrays Mary Donovan, had the opportunity to meet Mary\'s real-life grand-daughter. Ryan explained: ""I saw her family\'s wedding albums and vacation photos and heard firsthand stories, where I found out that Mary was born in Bay Ridge, raised in a strong Irish Catholic family, graduated from Marymount College and eventually settled down in Park Slope. Mary was proud of what her husband was doing, but she didn\'t like the attention it drew to her family, and worried that their children might be in danger.""', u'The actual Francis Gary Powers died in 1977. His son, Francis Gary Powers, Jr., was a consultant to the production, and also has a cameo in Bridge of Spies (2015) as a CIA Agent who is involved with the training of U-2 pilots, or ""DRIVERS"" as they were commonly referred to at the time.', u'Cinematographer Janusz Kaminski\'s first film with Steven Spielberg was Schindler\'s List (1993), and since that time they have worked on more than a dozen films together. According to Marc Platt: ""One can start a sentence and the other can finish it, and the result for us, as moviegoers, is to watch the film come to life, and to watch the beauty of it, the look and the feel of it, and that lies in whatever miraculously occurs between Janusz and Steven.""', u""In New York City, Manhattan's Metro Station at Broad Street was the setting for scenes of Rudolf Ivanovich Abel being tailed by the FBI, and of James B. Donovan on his way to work, as the producers felt that a live subway system was needed to realistically film a subway car from a station platform. Fortunately, New York City's Metropolitan Transportation Authority was eager to work with the production, allowing access to the subway station very early on a Sunday morning."", u""The picture was green-lit In June 2014 with the production being co-financed between three production houses: DreamWorks, Fox 2000 Pictures, and Participant Media.

The movie's distribution was split between two studios and was distributed worldwide by Disney Pictures and 20th Century Fox, depending on the territory.

Donovan (Tom Hanks) must discuss Abel\'s exchange. Vogel works for the Communist government of the German Democratic Republic (GDR), which was not recognized by the American government of the U.S., but was desperately trying to become its own country. Steven Spielberg explained: ""Nationalist East Germany was actually shaking their fists at the Soviets, saying, \'I know you feed and clothe us, and provide for us, but we are not your puppets."" Donovan ends up trading Abel to two different parties: Vogel and the GDR for Frederic L. Pryor at Checkpoint Charlie and Ivan Schischkin and the Soviets for Francis Gary Powers at the Glienicke Bridge.', u'Tom Hanks said of his co-star Mark Rylance: ""What Mark brings to the role is a completely-realized self-assuredness. Mark will not take a moment and throw it completely out, and come in and completely redo it. What Mark will do instead, is construct the character in the scene that slow little motions of feint, either one way or the next, will bring a new jolt of energy to, but is still the same character he built.""', u'A challenge for Michael Kahn for this film, was determining the best way to effectively combine multiple stories involving four different characters - James B. Donovan, Francis Gary Powers, Rudolf Ivanovich Abel, and Frederic L. Pryor - and showing how they were all connected, even though they were all quite different. Kristie Macosko Krieger said: ""That\'s part of the magic of Michael Kahn and Steven\'s collaboration . . . that they are able to put those things together so that they feel seamless when you see it finished.""', u'The set for the famous cold war German crossing point of ""Checkpoint Charlie"" was created for the movie in Poland.', u'This theatrical film covers various elements and some of the same subject matter as the earlier television movie called Francis Gary Powers: The True Story of the U-2 Spy Incident (1976).', u'The last day of filming for Tom Hanks during principal photography was the integral pinnacle spy trade exchange sequence on the Glienicke Bridge set.', u'The movie\'s title shares its name with a non-fiction book by Giles Whittell, which was first published in 2010. It is titled ""Bridge of Spies: A True Story of the Cold War"".', u'Structurally the story is a study in shifting moods and environments, opening in Brooklyn in 1957 with the action eventually moving to East Berlin. Because of this, the production utilized two different crews for principal photography. There was one crew to film scenes in and around New York and a different crew for Poland and Germany, each with its own pre-production schedule, and each tasked with effectively creating their own cinematic universe that needed to remain faithful to period details.', u'A strong sense of history infused the production once filming began in Europe, as the iconic locations helped depict, in stark images, the horrors to which the East Germans were subjected, instilling a sense of respect for what these people had endured.', u""Flughafen Tempelhof Airport in the south-central section of Berlin, Germany is where the historic airlifts of 1948 and 1949 took place, and was an indispensable location. These airlifts took place when the Soviet Army closed off access to the western part of the city by all other means of transport. Planes from the U.S., Great Britain, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa, transported food and supplies to the city's inhabitants to prevent them from starving. Steven Spielberg filmed multiple scenes at Flughafen Tempelhof Airport, including the return home of both James B. Donovan and Francis Gary Powers to the U.S. inside a U.S. Army cargo transport plane. Scenes featuring actual U-2 planes, both on the ground and in the air, were shot several months later at Beale Air Force Base in Yuba County, California."", u""The Berlin Wall was in the midst of construction when James B. Donovan's story took place, and Steven Spielberg wanted the audience to see it being built on-screen as well. The first version that went up was a makeshift wall made from concrete blocks and barbed wire, which was quickly replaced with the version most recognize today with reinforced cement slabs and an enormous pipe on top, making it much more sturdy and more difficult to scale."", u'Production in Berlin, Germany coincided with the 25th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall. Even though the city of Berlin was located entirely within the Soviet portion of Germany, East Berlin was part of the Soviet Union; West Berlin was not. Residents of the city were able to go back and forth until the GDR built the Berlin Wall to separate the two cities, and entrance was only accessible at one of several check points located along the Wall.', u'For the character of Mary Donovan, costume designer Kasia Walicka-Maimone drew inspiration from Jacqueline Kennedy, and accentuated Ryan\'s look with a string of pearls, and glasses similar to ones worn by the real Mary Donovan. Kasia Walicka-Maimone said: ""We had a lot of good information about the real Mary Donovan, most of which came from Amy, including some amazing photographs from the family\'s personal collection. Looking at those photos helped us understand the essence of who this woman was. We created a lot of pieces for her, like the green coat she wears in the courtroom, which seemed to represent the era and, subliminally, provide the audience with a better feeling of that time."" Ryan said: ""She created these beautiful looks for the time period, and even though my costumes were more casual in style, each was more beautiful than the next. But the undergarments were far more constricting than what I\'m used to wearing, which, believe it or not, helped me get into character since I had to move differently.""', u'Music has always played a crucial role in Steven Spielberg\'s films, but from day one Spielberg envisioned Bridge of Spies (2015) differently. There are approximately thirty-eight minutes of music in Saving Private Ryan (1998) and about 38 to 40 minutes of music in Bridge of Spies (2015), and there is no music in this film for around the first twenty minutes. Spielberg explained: ""Many of my films are dependent on score, sometimes even dependent on wall-to-wall scoring, but I didn\'t feel \'Bridge of Spies\' was that way, the same way I didn\'t feel that \'Private Ryan\' needed wall-to-wall music.""', u'Molding a film about the courageous exploits of a family man turned Cold War spy negotiator presented editor Michael Kahn with a unique challenge. Kahn explained: ""It was a big dialogue piece. He (Steven Spielberg) shot it in more of a conventional way, where dialogue was key. He wanted the audience to really be involved in what was being said, and to really think about things, so we didn\'t cut it like an action film. In fact, Tom Hanks\' and Mark Rylance\'s performances were so scintillating at some points, that it was difficult to cut away at all.""', u'Production designer Adam Stockhausen and his department built approximately three hundred yards of the Berlin Wall at different phases of its construction with the same materials and same dimensions as the original. It is when the American student Frederic L. Pryor (Will Rogers) comes into the story, that the audience first sees the Berlin Wall. Pryor, while visiting a professor in East Berlin, whose daughter also happens to be his girlfriend, has an unfortunate encounter with the East German border guards, who arrest him as he tries to return to West Germany.

Donovan\'s powerful story without overpowering it. Thomas Newman said: ""This is an American story - the difficulty was figuring out the best way to represent America in a way that didn\'t sugar-coat anything, while representing the ideals of Donovan at the same time. What it ended up boiling down to, for me, was simple family values, a sense of what it means to be an American in the most idealized sense of the word.""

Newman explained: ""In terms of that color, I didn\'t want the music to say, \'Okay, here is Russia and here is America, and Russia is going to be represented by deep male voices,\' but I did want to kind of push that as a means of compelling the story.""', u'Michael Kahn is one of director Steven Spielberg\'s long-time collaborators, a relationship that dates back to Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977). According to Tom Hanks: ""Matt Charman realized that there was something fantastic there, and wrote it up, and then the Coens (Joel Coen and Ethan Coen) end up sprinkling their substantial amount of fairy dust on it. Some of those are in the text, but the timing and the composition is all Steven and Michael. Thank God they have the shorthand that they do, because no one can write that stuff.""', u'Donovan is not just a simple lawyer from a firm that specializes in insurance claims. Prior to joining this law firm he was the general counsel to the OSS, the precursor to the CIA.', u'Screenwriter Matt Charman went to London to start writing, and within six weeks delivered a thought-provoking, well-crafted script that generated a wonderful feeling of suspense between the multiple stories. Steven Spielberg said: ""Matt did a good job of connecting the Powers story with the Abel/Donovan story."" It was a clever, and important, juxtaposition because Powers was technically doing the same thing Abel was arrested for, only from the air, and Charman knew that, structurally, he needed to make all of the different stories speak to one another. Platt agreed, saying, ""Matt did a fantastic job, and once he was finished, we brought his draft to the Coen brothers, who write with a tone which is real, yet has a particular edge to it, which was perfect for this story.""', u'Crucial was finding an actor to play a captured Soviet spy, with divergent loyalties and surprising depth, who was interesting enough that the audience would be able to feel his humanity and thoughtfulness . . . and someone who could hold his own opposite Tom Hanks, as well. Steven Spielberg has always appreciated actors who portray their characters in an honest and truthful way, and as a result, was drawn to Mark Rylance. For years, he had been following the career of the English actor, and was eager to work with him, just looking for the right part. Spielberg said: ""Mark is one of the most extraordinary actors working anywhere. I saw him in \'Twelfth Night\', and that pretty much cinched it for me.""', u'For Mark Rylance, an actor best known for his acclaimed stage work in such productions as ""Jerusalem"" and ""Boeing-Boeing"" and the then recent PBS miniseries Wolf Hall (2015), the opportunity to work with Steven Spielberg was incredibly humbling. And while Rudolf Ivanovich Abel was a divisive figure, his selfless patriotism earns the respect and admiration of James Donovan, which Rylance found tremendously appealing. Rylance also found the story moving and incredibly entertaining, and he appreciated the fact that it had the potential to really cause people to think. Rylance said: ""This is a film about a man who does the right thing at the right time in the right place, and it\'s an important story.""', u'Amy Ryan, was especially thrilled to have the opportunity to work with Tom Hanks, who plays her husband James B. Donovan in the film. Ryan found Hanks generous, both in spirit and energy. Ryan said: ""I was very impressed with the amount of enthusiasm he was able to bring to each scene, and he\'s had so much experience as an actor, that I tried to listen and observe as much as I could,"" she says. ""In addition to all the technical sides of knowing where the camera is going to be and where the lights are, he is still able to inhabit the scene so fully and truthfully . . . that is an amazing skill."" And for Hanks, the feeling was mutual. He said: ""Working with Amy was amazing . . . I was always thinking that it looked as if she was hardly doing anything, and yet she was doing everything all at the same time.""', u""Francis Gary Powers, Jr., who has a cameo, and was a consultant to the production, and is the son of Francis Gary Powers, according to the film's DVD documentaries, is the Founder and Chairman Emeritus of the Cold War Museum."", u'Marc Platt explained of the production: ""Producing this film was interesting because it was almost like we were making two separate films, which is representative of the extraordinary journey that James Donovan goes on. We first meet him in Brooklyn where he takes on the case, which was one movie, and then he travels unexpectedly to a completely different part of the world, a completely different culture, which felt like an entirely different film.""', u'Kristie Macosko Krieger said of the production: ""It was pretty complex. We knew we wanted the audience to go on a journey, and we shot, for the most part, in continuity. Because of time constraints we had a few scheduling issues with some of the crew we normally work with, which allowed us to discover some amazing people that we had never used before. We had Adam Stockhausen, who is a brilliant production designer; Kasia Walicka-Maimone, our costume designer; and the composer Thomas Newman, and those three really helped infuse the film with vitality.""', u'Tom Hanks said of filming this movie about the Cold War: ""There was not a single day when we didn\'t show up on the set for the first time and think, holy cow, this is not just an odd little re-creation . . . this is a three-dimensional, authentic, holographic representation of what it was.""', u'Renowned for his ability to capture emotional details amidst stunning visuals, Janusz Kaminski\'s primary goal, is establishing a cinematic grammar in which to tell the story. Fortunately, with ""Bridge of Spies,"" the outstanding locations, set dressing and costumes provided countless opportunities for the camera.', u'Tom Hanks said of Janusz Kaminski: ""What I love about working with Janusz, is that I can understand very quickly the stakes that he\'s going for. I can ask him what will be in the shot and he will tell me, so I have the luxury of working with someone like that who will help me, which means a couple of things: I will not screw up the shot, and he will help me get another little moment of James Donovan into a scene.""', u""On November 9, 2014, thousands of people gathered in Potsdamer Platz to commemorate the date when the East German Government rescinded travel restrictions between East Germany and West Germany. For the cast and crew filming the following day on the set of the Friedrichstrasse Station created by Adam Stockhausen's team, it was a vivid reminder of the conditions of violence, surveillance and deprivation, under which the East Germans lived."", u'The wardrobe reflected the culture and the period of the story, helping to articulate Spielberg\'s vision. Tom Hanks said: ""The costumes were off the scale, which is really saying something. Anyone can go to a costume house and rent a bunch of stuff, but they still end up looking like rental costumes. I don\'t know how she did it, but Kasia (Kasia Walicka-Maimone) was always coming up with fresh ideas, everything down to the waitress uniforms in Berlin\'s Hilton Hotel . . . but that\'s what artists do.""', u'When shooting exteriors, the period costumes worn by extras helped reinforce the sense that these scenes, despite a vibrant immediacy in the present, were happening in the somewhat distant, yet recognizable, past. Some scenes featured over three hundred extras, everything from spectators and reporters in court, to subway passengers and pedestrians on the streets, and on cold days, required dressing them not only in clothing, but with appropriate accessories, like hats, scarves, gloves, and overcoats as well.', u'Kasia Walicka-Maimone said: ""We needed to effectively represent the period and the colors of the period, so (production designer) Adam (Stockhausen) and I mapped out the balance of colors to figure out how everything was going to match. We absorb as much of the vocabulary from that time period as we can, choose whatever is needed for the particular frame of the film, and then construct those realities so they are strong enough to resonate the period, while not overwhelming the story.""', u""Equally key was ensuring all the wardrobe colors were authentic for the specific time period. Scenes set in New York City featured clothing that was much more color-driven, representing the successful, commercial world of America in the 1950s, with women wearing predominantly green, maroon and yellow, and men, brown, gray and navy. In Berlin, colors were scarce and muted when used, as most everything was black and/or dull gray to reflect the city's dismal atmosphere at the time."", u""When Thomas Newman's music score kicks in after about twenty minutes into the movie, the music is understated and brilliant in its simplicity. As James B. Donovan becomes more involved with the CIA, the score escalates from simple piano to full orchestration, a subtle difference, but one which Steven Spielberg believed would add some emotional weight to the friendship between Rudolf Ivanovich Abel and James B. Donovan."", u'Thomas Newman said of his music for the film: ""It\'s pretty compelling. The sounds of New York City really set up a sense of anticipation about what was going to happen to Abel. Francis Gary Powers\' plane crash is also brilliantly done without music, and it\'s just thrilling that it\'s all sound.""', u'Thomas Newman said of working with Steven Spielberg: ""When Steven and I would get together to discuss the music, he was always looking at the movie as someone who was trying to enjoy it and trying to relate to it as opposed to someone who had intentions. So he would watch and listen and he would react, which was ultimately very rewarding, because I felt like I found my own voice and that the voice was accepted by Steven.""', u'Tom Hanks adds, ""When you show up on Steven\'s set, it has already been built, not only physically, but deep inside Steven\'s head. Your job is to do exactly what he wants you to do, but he also expects you to add in all the little things he expects you to come up with. He has the film cut in his head long before we even get to the set. He reads the screenplay thousands and thousands of times, over and over and over again, so he knows what he\'s going to be doing, cinematically, five weeks from now.""', u'The picture was a tremendous learning experience for Amy Ryan. She said: ""Steven is so enthusiastic about what he\'s doing, that it\'s infectious. There were times when I would be observing him at work, and all of a sudden his eyes would get big as saucers, almost as if he was this twelve year-old boy still making films in his backyard.""', u'Of Tom Hanks, Steven Spielberg and Kristie Macosko Krieger said respectively: ""Tom is the perfect collaborator. He will try anything and he\'s got a thousand ideas, and is open to a thousand ideas from other people. He\'s this incredibly creative vessel that just wants to figure things out in a more original way"" (Spielberg), and """"Watching Tom and Steven work is such a joy, such a pleasure. They are both really masters at what they do, and you can see it. They have such fluidity and a sense of ease with each other, which really brings out the best in one another."" (Krieger).', u'Amy Ryan signed on as James B. Donovan\'s supportive but strong-willed wife, Mary. In discussing what attracted her to the project, Ryan said: ""Most screenplays take ten or fifteen pages before you get a sense of who the characters really are, but we find out that James Donovan is a fast-talking lawyer in the first few pages. Plus, I liked the fact that this woman, Mary Donovan, wasn\'t just a \'Yes dear, of course dear\' kind of wife. She had things of substance to say and really good, strong, smart opinions about the world in which her husband was stepping foot into, and I found that genuinely appealing.""', u'Steven Spielberg also puts a tremendous amount of focus on the narrative. While some directors are focused on the feelings of the actors or the beauty of the images, he\'s more concerned about where the audience\'s imagination is. Kristie Macosko Krieger said: ""What\'s great about Steven, is that he truly loves being on set. In the mornings when we get to work I\'ll say, \'Is there anything else you\'d rather be doing in the world right now?\' and he says, \'No,\' and it\'s true. He knows he is incredibly lucky to do what he does.""', u'Steven Spielberg and Martin Scorsese held a Q&A discussion together to talk about Bridge of Spies (2015).', u""Amy Ryan and Domenick Lombardozzi both appeared in HBO's The Wire (2002)."", u""The film's story was inspired by true events."", u'The fevered years of the Cold War, a war that involved information, not combat, was a war where words were the ultimate weapon. It was a time when anti-Communist propaganda, ""Duck and Cover"" educational videos, and the media\'s sensationalist coverage of events like the Rosenberg trial bred fear and hatred across the country . . . . hatred stemming from fear of the unknown. No one was safe, and it was an especially dangerous time to be in the headlines for defending a Russian spy...A dramatic thriller set against the backdrop of a series of historic events, ""Bridge of Spies"" is the story of James B. Donovan played by Tom Hanks, an insurance claims lawyer from Brooklyn who finds himself thrust into the center of the Cold War when the CIA enlists his support to negotiate the release of a captured American U-2 pilot.', u'Once a finished screenplay was in hand, plans to make the film quickly accelerated. A stellar production team was soon in place, including: two-time Academy Award winner Janusz Kaminski as director of photography; Oscar winner Adam Stockhausen as production designer; Kasia Walicka-Maimone as costume designer; three time Academy Award winner Michael Kahn A.C.E. as editor; and twelve time Oscar nominee Thomas Newman as music composer. Producer Kristie Macosko Krieger said: ""Steven loves authenticity and we assembled an amazing group of artists to work with him . . . some of whom we had worked with before, and some who were new to us.""', u""Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg share a unique, creative relationship, one that elevates any film with which they're involved. Previous collaborations prior to this have included Saving Private Ryan (1998), Catch Me If You Can (2002), and The Terminal (2004), as well as the Emmy and Golden Globe winning HBO mini-series Band of Brothers (2001), which is based on Stephen Ambrose's book, as well as the Emmy winning television mini-series The Pacific (2010), both television productions of which, they were producers."", u'Steven Spielberg said of the James B. Donovan character: ""James Donovan was what you would call a stand-up kind of guy, someone who stands up for what he believes in, which, in his case, is justice for all, regardless of what side of the Iron Curtain you are on. He was only interested in the letter of the law. And Tom\'s own morality and his own sense of equality and fairness, and the fact that he does such good things in the world by wisely using his celebrity, made him the perfect fit.""', u'Marc Platt said of Tom Hanks: ""Tom is a history buff. You can tell this from some of the great miniseries and films he\'s produced, and acted in. But he also has a particular interest in this period. The Cold War and East/West Berlin politics is something he knows a good deal about.""', u'Amy Ryan\'s biggest challenge was making her character, Mary Donovan, a woman in the midst of extremely-trying circumstances, believable. Marc Platt said: ""Amy\'s portrayal of Mary has us rooting for her, but we also feel her conflict over wanting to protect her family. Her husband\'s involvement with the case brings the family some danger, and causes friends to sort of drop away, and you feel the tug-of-war within her to want to protect and love her husband and do what he thinks is right, and yet to protect her family at the same time, and you love her for that conflict.""', u'With the story\'s protagonists in place, the filmmakers set out to cast the supporting roles integral to James B. Donovan\'s story, consulting with New York City-based casting director Ellen Lewis. Steven Spielberg said: ""There have been many times when I wanted to use Ellen but she was working with Scorsese, and this was an opportunity where Marty wasn\'t working, and Ellen was available, which was great, because I wanted to use predominantly stage actors.""', u'Theater actor Scott Shepherd, who received Obie Awards for his performances in ""Gatz"" and ""Poor Theater"", and has appeared on-screen in Side Effects (2013), was cast as Hoffman, the shrewd CIA Operations Officer. The CIA was looking for a private citizen, like James B. Donovan, to negotiate the swap in East Berlin, so it wouldn\'t be governments talking, and it is Hoffman who secures Donovan\'s participation in the dangerous mission. But the two men soon go head-to-head, as Shepherd expects Donovan to value national security over attorney-client privilege.', u'Fourth movie where Tom Hanks has a love interest, played by actress who is last named ""Ryan"".

The German Democratic Republic (GDR) will broker the exchange directly with him.

Stowell, had been most recently seen in the highly-acclaimed film Whiplash (2014), and plays Francis Gary Powers in Bridge of Spies (2015), the young Air Force pilot who joins the CIA to fly covert missions in a U-2 spy plane, and is subsequently shot down over the Soviet Union. There, he is imprisoned and subjected to solitary confinement and sleep deprivation, eventually suffering the humiliation of a very public Moscow show trial.', u'Michael Gor, who played the Bond villain Vladimir Popov in Die Another Day (2002), signed on as the enigmatic Ivan Schischkin, a Soviet official who calls himself an assistant secretary in the Soviet East Embassy in East Berlin, but who is, in fact, a high-level KGB operative, with whom Donovan must negotiate.

She explained: ""With each project we have to come up with new ways to understand what the story is telling us, to really grasp the color of the period and represent it in a subtle way that helps to portray the story and not overpower it.""', u""This film was Kasia Walicka-Maimone's first film with Steven Spielberg, and she was thrilled to find they spoke the same language, and shared a similar visual understanding of the story. Working closely with Adam Stockhausen, she immersed herself in the worlds in which the characters existed, hoping to find a glimpse into the truth about them. Fortunately, she had a great deal of freedom when creating the looks, which would define each character, because they weren't playing iconic people anyone would actually recognize."", u'Kasia Walicka-Maimone said: ""Our job was to deliver a sense of reality in those scenes. We discussed every single extra that needed to be dressed, because in order to represent a crowd effectively, you need to have a good mix of people.

He played Viktor Navorski, a visitor to the U.S. from the fictional country of Krakozhia . In Bridge of Spies (2015), Hanks portrays James B. Donovan, an American lawyer from the U.S. In The Terminal (2004), though Viktor comes from Krakozhia, the language he speaks in the movie is Bulgarian. The written material shown, such as the Fodor's guide, and the magazine page with the jazz greats, is in bad Russian, while the label on the Planter's Peanuts can is neither in Bulgarian, nor in Russian. Viktor's driver's license is issued in Homel, Republic of Belarus, and has a woman's name on it - Gulnara Gulina - and is written in Cyrillic. It was a real license, provided by Gulnara Gulina, a woman from Belarus, who was working in the American film industry.

She said: ""Every director is a visual storyteller, but what sets Steven apart, is that he is literally taking in everything that\'s going on around him. He allows every other department to be at their best at all times, because he trusts them, so there is a sense of calmness on the set, because every person on the crew has the confidence to do what they do so well."" Kristie Macosko Krieger added of Janusz Kaminski: ""Watching Janusz work is phenomenal. He sees things that none of us can see, and he sees it in the light, and he sees it where the camera is, and it just seems so instinctual to him.""', u'For Janusz Kaminski, who hoped to visually convey the reality of the Cold War on-screen, he needed to come up with creative ways to revive the period, while not going overboard, as he knew that too much imagery would look fake. Steven Spielberg explained: ""We didn\'t have the budget to put blue screen and show miles and miles of digital period buildings out the window, so we had the windows frosted over. Then Janusz brought all the light, one source, a single source, from the glass, and it gave that first meeting between Donovan and Abel, a real coldness. As a warmth began to develop, or at least the opportunity for a relationship began to occur to us (and to them), you could interpret that cool light as being sort of a wall between them that would slowly come down over the course of their story.""', u'The contributions of Marc Platt and Kristie Macosko Krieger were quite substantial, according to Tom Hanks, who explained: ""Kristie knows everything in and out, back and forth. She knows the script better than I do, and she knows the subtext of every discussion she\'s ever had with Steven. Kristie realizes we\'ve got eighty-two billion working parts, and she can break down every one of those. No matter what is going on with Kristie at that exact moment, you can come up to her and have a fully-realized conversation about the topic at hand. She can tell you exactly what the status is of anything."" Hanks added: ""Marc knows the place that the movie holds in the Zeitgeist of films. He takes into account the history, the period and the casting choices and views it as a single-celled creature. A lot of times producers are beholden to the director, because without the director, their film doesn\'t get made. But I think Steven is beholden to Kristie and Marc, because without them, he doesn\'t have the freedom to think about the work purely in cinematic terms.""', u'Mark Rylance, who plays Rudolf Ivanovich Abel, said of Steven Spielberg: ""Steven is a very fatherly figure. I didn\'t realize how important and how much time he puts into his family until we worked together. I don\'t know how he finds the time with all the things he\'s doing, but he\'s really quite a family man and has maintained that, which is quite extraordinary for such a busy person.""', u'In addition to being an amazingly-proficient filmmaker, Steven Spielberg is genuinely concerned about his actors, and has a profound respect for their craft, constantly looking for ways to create a story on-screen in the easiest and most natural way possible. Tom Hanks said: ""Steven and I have a pretty good shorthand. I would come in with an enthusiastic idea for how to go about the scene and Steven would say, \'That\'s great, because what I want to do is play it all the way from back here, and if you\'re moving around like that, that\'s where the eye is going to go\'.""', u'Mark Rylance was amazed by the amount of preparation involved with each setup on this movie, comparing it with a Renaissance workshop. Rylance said: ""Steven comes in and you see him take in everything all around him. He is in total command of the big picture and everything going through the frame, the sets, the background actors, all the movements. Watching him, I imagined Leonardo Da Vinci at work. He was like a painter, but working with moving pictures.""', u'In the film, people judge Rudolf Ivanovich Abel for who they think he is and what they think he is doing, but James B. Donovan sees something different in him. And Francis Gary Powers is being judged as someone who let himself fall into enemy hands, yet Donovan sees him as a pilot who did his best, who didn\'t give any secrets away but who held the line. Kristie Macosko Krieger said: ""There is this wonderful moment at the end of the film, when people on the subway who had misjudged Donovan earlier, are looking at him anew because they realize what he\'s accomplished, and that they were wrong to judge this guy, and this situation. It\'s a fantastic moment for his character."" Navigating the unfamiliar waters of high-stakes international intrigue, James B. Donovan rose to the occasion with a modesty befitting the heroic acts that he performs, becoming an unsung civilian hero, and, in the process, the inspiration for an incredibly powerful story, and film.', u'Second movie collaboration of Tom Hanks with The Coen Brothers. The first had been the remake The Ladykillers (2004), which the Coen brothers both co-wrote and both co-directed, the film being based on the original The Ladykillers (1955).

Donovan was also influential in the Bay of Pigs negotiations, shortly after the events of the film. Donovan was asked to obtain freedom for detained Cubans and Americans imprisoned during the failed Bay of Pigs invasion of 1961. Over the course of several trips to the island, Donovan gained the confidence of Cuban leader Fidel Castro. He eventually secured the release of more than 1,100 survivors of the invasion, as well as another 8,500 political prisoners.', u'The film\'s closing epilogue and postscript states: ""Following his return to Russia, Rudolf Abel (Rudolf Ivanovich Abel) was reunited with his wife and daughter. He was never publicly acknowledged by the Soviet Union as a spy. Gary Powers (Francis Gary Powers) died in a helicopter crash in 1977, while working for KNBC news. He was posthumously awarded the CIA Director\'s Medal and U.S.A.F. P.O.W. Medal in 2000, and the Silver Star in 2012. In 1962, Frederic L. Pryor received his Ph.D. in Economics from Yale University. He is currently Professor Emeritus of Economics and Senior Research Scholar at Swarthmore College. Following the successful conclusion of the Powers-Abel exchange, James Donovan was asked by President Kennedy (John F. Kennedy) to undertake further negotiations on behalf of the U.S. In the summer of 1962, he was sent to Cuba, to discuss with Fidel Castro, the terms of release of 1,113 prisoners held after the Bay of Pigs invasion.

It is unknown how DiCaprio convinced Day-Lewis to take the role."", u'Daniel Day-Lewis originally turned down the role of Abraham Lincoln, sending Steven Spielberg this letter: ""Dear Steven. It was a real pleasure just to sit and talk with you. I listened very carefully to what you had to say about this compelling history, and I\'ve since read the script and found it - in all the detail of which it describes these monumental events and in the compassionate portraits of all the principle characters - both powerful and moving. I can\'t account for how at any given moment I feel the need to explore one life as opposed to another. But I do know that I can only do this work if I feel almost as if there\'s no choice; that a subject coincides inexplicably with a very personal need and a very specific moment in time. In this case, as fascinated as I was by \'Abe,\' it was the fascination of a grateful spectator who longed to see a story told rather than that of a participant. That\'s how I feel now in spite of myself, and though I can\'t be sure this won\'t change, I couldn\'t dream of encouraging you to keep it open on a mere possibility. I do hope this makes sense Steven. I\'m glad you\'re making the film. I wish you the strength for it and I send both my very best wishes and my sincere gratitude to you for having considered me. Daniel.""', u'Describing his experience playing Abraham Lincoln, Daniel Day-Lewis said, ""I never, ever felt that depth of love for another human being that I never met. And that\'s, I think, probably the effect that Lincoln has on most people that take the time to discover him... I wish he had stayed (with me) forever.""', u""Steven Spielberg spent twelve years researching the film. He recreated Abraham Lincoln's Executive Mansion office precisely, with the same wallpaper and books Lincoln used. The ticking of Lincoln's watch in the film is the sound of Lincoln's actual pocket watch. Lincoln's watch is housed in the Kentucky Historical Society in Frankfort, Kentucky (not the Lincoln Presidential Library.)

Additionally, he wore a suit every day on set: ""I think I wanted to get into the role, more than anything else, of being part of that experience - because we were recreating a piece of history.

In November 2012, Dr. Ranjan Batra, a (non-historian) academician at the University of Mississippi, saw Lincoln (2012), then did an Internet search to find out more about the Amendment. He and his colleague Ken Sullivan discovered that although Mississippi voted to ratify the amendment in 1995, a clerical oversight caused that vote to remain officially unacknowledged, since the Mississippi Secretary of State had never sent the vote's result to the U. S. Office of the Federal Register. After Sullivan also saw the movie, both men urged the office of the Mississippi Secretary of State to file that paperwork, which they did on January 30, 2013; on February 7, 2013, the director of the Federal Register confirmed its receipt along with the fact that Mississippi had finally ratified the 13th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States."", u'Daniel Day-Lewis is the first of two actors to win an acting Oscar for a movie directed by Steven Spielberg.

Spielberg believed she was too old to play the part, but Field was adamant. She recalled, ""I\'m ten years older than Daniel and twenty years older than Abraham Lincoln\'s wife was and Steven told me he didn\'t see me in the role. But I knew I was right for this part and begged him to let me audition for it. He was kind enough to do that and Daniel is such a sweetheart that he flew over from his home in Ireland to screen test with me. I\'ll love him forever for that.""', u""Lobbyist William N.

He read over twenty books and visited with the then-existing Lincoln Bicentennial Committee in Washington, D.C. The committee granted Neeson access to Lincoln's history such as personal letters. Neeson also visited Ford's Theater and viewed personal items such as Lincoln's wallet and the Bible used for his inauguration."", u""The ticking heard from Abraham Lincoln's pocket watch as he sits at his desk and plays with it is the actual ticking sound from the watch he carried in his pocket.

It is unknown if the story is true or not.', u'Toward the end of the film, Thaddeus Stevens and his black housekeeper Lydia Hamilton Smith are portrayed as romantic partners. Although there is no officially documented evidence in real life that the two had anything more than an employer/employee relationship, the two were the object of much speculation and rumor during and after their many decades of cohabitation. Some unusual aspects of their living arrangements that contributed to the contemporary rumor that they were romantically involved included the facts that she moved from separate servants\' quarters behind the house into Stevens\'s main house; she frequently served as the hostess for events held at his house; and several of his family members referred to her in terms usually reserved for spouses in their correspondence. Stevens and Smith were also depicted as lovers in the 1915 silent film The Birth of a Nation (1915), although contrary to this film\'s reasons for inclusion of a romantic relationship between them, that movie\'s director, D.W. Griffith, used their relationship as racist propaganda and as supposed ""proof"" of the North\'s degeneracy.', u'Although some viewers were surprised by the usage of the word ""fuck"" in the movie, the Oxford English Dictionary dates the word back to (at least) the early 1500s, around 350 years before the American Civil War and Abraham Lincoln\'s presidency. In the movie, the word is used only twice, both times by the vulgar and rough Bilbo character as a way of demonstrating his uncouthness. Viewers who thought they also heard Lincoln using the term to describe ""Tammany Hall hucksters"" during a monologue actually misheard the then-common word ""pettifogging,"" which means arguing endlessly over small legal details.', u'While giving a fiery speech against Abraham Lincoln, Fernando Wood calls him ""King Abrahamus Africanus The First."" This was the title of an 1864 pamphlet, which was illustrated with a drawing of Lincoln wearing a crown and subtitled ""his secret life, as revealed under the mesmeric influence; mysteries of the White House."" This pamphlet was printed by the ""Copperheads,"" a group of Northern Pro-Confederate Democrats to which Wood belonged. It claimed that Lincoln had signed a contract with Satan to enable him to seize the US presidency for life and to ""subvert the liberties of the American people and debauch their civic aspirations; to impose upon them in every imaginable form of low cunning, and cheat them with words of double meaning and with false promises, until by these, and kindred means, that end is accomplished, and his dynasty firmly established.""', u'Steven Spielberg was already developing this film when he met with Doris Kearns Goodwin and confided in her that he wanted to make a film about Abraham Lincoln. She told him that she was in the process of writing her book Team of Rivals. Spielberg immediately decided to use it as the basis for the film, and asked to reserve the film rights before the book was finished.', u""Liam Neeson, who was attached to play Abraham Lincoln since the project began development, decided to drop out. According to Neeson, he felt he was too old to play the part after waiting so many years for the project to get the go-ahead. Incidentally, Daniel Day-Lewis is only five years Neeson's junior, though still closest in age to Lincoln, who was 55 and 56 years of age at the time portrayed in the film."", u""Abraham Lincoln and his wife Mary have one of their famous fights, in which he threatens to have her committed to a mad house. In the case of this film, the issue they fight over is their son Robert's enlistment in the army. It would be Robert Lincoln who ultimately did commit his mother to an insane asylum, tragically leading to their permanent estrangement."", u'Sally Field gained twenty-five pounds in order to more accurately portray Mrs. Lincoln.', u'Every major character in the film was a real person or at least a composite of real figures and the film strives to reflect the actual actions or thoughts of the historical figures.', u""Daniel Day-Lewis was named Best Actor of the Year at the Academy Awards for his performance as Abraham Lincoln in this film. His Oscar was presented to him by Meryl Streep who was named Best Lead Actress the year before for her performance as Margaret Thatcher in The Iron Lady. Streep was presented her Oscar by Colin Firth who had been named Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role for his performance as King George VI in The King's Speech one year prior. So in a span of three years, lead acting Oscars were awarded for portrayals of the King England, the British Prime Minister and the President of the United States."", u""According to Steven Spielberg during a chat at the University of Southern California's film school, the film came very close to premiering on HBO as opposed to premiering in theaters. Spielberg claimed that the only reason why the film reached theaters was because of his co-ownership in DreamWorks, which was one of the studios behind the film's release."", u'Steven Spielberg told a preview audience in Manhattan that screenwriter Tony Kushner spent about six years working on the movie.

Both men had southern Vice Presidents named Johnson. Lincoln was shot at the Ford\'s Theatre by an actor named John Wilkes Booth. Kennedy was riding in a Ford Lincoln Mercury when he was shot by Lee Harvey Oswald, who hid out in a movie theatre. This film adds three more similarities to the mix: it was produced by Kathleen Kennedy, features Tommy Lee Jones, who also appeared in JFK - avoin tapaus (1991), and both movies were scored by John Williams.

He also refused to dye his hair for the role, arguing Indy\'s appeal wasn\'t in his youth, but in his imagination and resourcefulness: ""My ambition in action is to have the audience look straight in my face, and not the back of a stuntman\'s head.

He explained that it would be interesting to see Indiana in a different decade, and deal with all kinds of new and interesting things. The age also adds to Indiana as a fallible, and therefore believable character. Ford spent three hours a day at the gym, and subsisted on a high-protein diet of fish and vegetables, thus building his body into a condition where he could perform his own stunts (he always kept himself fit anyway, as he hoped to complete all five Indiana Jones films that were originally planned in the 1980s). Steven Spielberg later stated he was so impressed with Ford\'s form, that he could not tell the difference between the shoots for the third and fourth films.', u""Sir Sean Connery was approached for a cameo appearance as Henry Jones, Sr., Indiana's father, but he turned it down, finding retirement too enjoyable.

George Lucas also felt that the 1950s decade would have to take into account the Cold War, and when he heard that that Joseph Stalin had been interested in crystal skulls, he made the Soviets the script\'s villains.', u'Steven Spielberg cast Russian actors in the roles of Russian soldiers, so their accents would be authentic.', u'The nuclear bomb test that Indiana Jones finds himself in is loosely based on the Operation Teapot atomic bomb tests of 1955, detonated on the Nevada Test Site. Most notable is the use of buildings and mannequins to observe the destructive force of the explosion, which was also featured in the nuclear bomb test in the film. The announcements and countdown preceding the explosion are based on the Ivy Mike test of 1952, the very first detonation of a hydrogen bomb (most notably the warning ""Do not remove goggles or face blast until ten seconds after first light."")', u'The girl who punches Mutt in the diner scene is Sasha Spielberg, daughter of Director Steven Spielberg and Kate Capshaw (Willie Scott from Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984)).', u'The Akator throne room designed by Guy Hendrix Dyas keeps up an Indiana Jones tradition by having C-3PO and R2-D2 etched into one of the yellow titles, and E.T. into another. According to the book ""The Complete Making of Indiana Jones"", the characters can be found somewhere in all four Indiana Jones pictures.', u'In 2006, Harrison Ford declared that if this film was not made by 2008, then the filmmakers should drop the idea altogether. This got Steven Spielberg looking for a good script immediately.', u""For his role as Spalko's henchman, Dimitri Diatchenko bulked up his physique to look more menacing, arriving at two hundred fifty pounds through weightlifting.

To prepare for his role as the greaser Mutt Williams, LeBeouf repeatedly watched the previous three Indiana Jones films, as well as The Wild One (1953), Rebel Without a Cause (1955), and Blackboard Jungle (1955), in addition to gaining fifteen pounds of muscle."", u'According to the George Lucas interview from the Special Effects documentary included on the DVD, the concept for the giant, flesh-eating ants was lifted directly from an abandoned script for Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989).', u'The ""Kung Fu Aztecs"", who attacked Indiana and Mutt in the graveyard, are not as historically inaccurate as one may think. Pre-Spanish Peru Incans did in fact practice a Martial Art known as ""Rumi Maki"", which literally translates as ""Hard Hands"".', u'Sir John Hurt wanted to read the script before he signed on. He had previously heard about actors and actresses who signed on to a Steven Spielberg film before reading the script, since ""Spielberg - you know, GOD - was doing it!"" Hurt replied, ""\'Well, I need to have a little bit of previous knowledge even if God is doing it."" The filmmakers sent a courier with the script from Los Angeles over to London, who gave the script to Hurt at three in the afternoon, reclaimed it at eight that evening, and flew back the following day. Ray Winstone mentioned a similar experience on a British chat show. He was asked if he wanted to be in the film, and he requested to read the script. He described a young man in a suit coming to his house, drinking tea while he read it, then getting on the next plane back to America. He also noted that once the film was over, they had to give the scripts back.', u'Steven Spielberg included the opening scene where the car driven by a group of students racing against a car driven by a Russian soldier as an homage to his friend George Lucas. In his youth, Lucas had a passion of car racing. In the previous movie, Spielberg included the opening prologue as an homage to his experiences as a Boy Scout.', u'At a pre-production press conference at Yale, Producer Frank Marshall said that Indiana\'s fictional Marshall College is indeed named after him. He quipped, ""If my last name was Yale, it would be Yale College.""', u'In the chase scene through the campus, Indiana and Mutt crash land in the library, where Indiana is asked a question by one of his students regarding research. Indiana responds by saying something to the effect of research being best obtained by getting out of the library, and into the field. This seems to contradict Indiana\'s advice in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989), when he tells his students that ""Seventy percent of all archeology is done in the library. Research, reading. We cannot afford to take mythology at face value."" However, in Crusade, his claim that ""X never, ever marks the spot"" was also disproved, so Indiana may have found it necessary to change his advice since then.', u'The film was delivered to theaters with a combination lock. The combination wasn\'t provided until the day of the first showing. Code names for the film were ""Band Wagon"" and ""Turbo"".', u""The U.S. version of the teaser trailer was modified so you don't see any guns. In the international version, the U.S. flag was removed."", u'Security throughout filming was very tight, with one of the measures to prevent information leaks, was to address the cast with false names in daily call sheets.

Thus Kaminski had to watch all of the previous films repeatedly, to study Slocombe\'s techniques.

It was sub-titled ""Saucerman from Mars"", and featured many plot elements used in the film, including the Doomtown nuclear sequence, launch bay test fight, the jungle, Russian enemies, as well as Indiana getting married in the end to a fellow scientist called Dr. Molly. The second draft, written by Jeffrey Boam in 1995, simply called ""Indy IV"", had Indiana searching for Noah\'s Ark. Boam\'s draft contains elements that were used in the final film, including having Marion back from the first film, Indiana having a son (called Abner, and was described as a geek), aliens, and the main object was a crystal skull. This draft could have been used, if the film was released in 1996, but was shelved at that time, because, according to Spielberg, of the release of Independence Day (1996), which also contained aliens.

One of them was when the group found one of the terrorists in Norway. The target was exiting a bus with a pregnant woman, and they killed him. The authorities tracked down the Agents' license plate number and arrested them, but it was later revealed that they had shot the wrong man. He wasn't even Palestinian, but a Moroccan waiter, and the pregnant woman was his wife.

However, this film was an exception. According to him, he accepted the role of Robert, because he jumped at the chance to work with Steven Spielberg.', u'Avner is referred to as a ""sabra"" more than once. This is an Israeli term for a native born Jew, as opposed to an immigrant. ""Sabra"" originally referred to a tough kind of cactus (Opuntia cactus) which grew out in the desert.', u'The ending of the movie conflicts with the real-life one, where the Mossad Agents successfully bombed the mastermind of the Munich killings, along with his four bodyguards and three innocent bystanders. They also injured sixteen innocent bystanders.', u'This film is based on George Jonas\' book ""Vengeance"". It purports to tell the true story of vengeance taken against the Black September terrorists using a supposed former Mossad Agent named Yuval Aviv as Jonas\' main source.

Aviv counters this by saying that they would deny him anyway.', u'The role of Avner was written with Eric Bana in mind.', u'The time span between the start of production to the release date in December of 2005 was less than six months.', u'The film crews called the shooting of the movie as a ""race against the clock"". In order to have the film ready by Christmas for Academy Awards consideration, Steven Spielberg and Editor Michael Kahn devised an editing schedule in which: 1) All of the scenes in Malta and Hungary shot in twelve weeks were edited on the spot. Each day, Spielberg would review an edited scene shot two days earlier. 2) Two copies of the edited scene were sent out, one to John Williams for music and the other to Ben Burtt for sound effects. 3) The Paris and New York City scenes were edited two weeks after photography, and the final cut was readied after another two weeks.', u""In the opening segment of the movie, there is a brief shot of two Israeli girls watching television appearing twice.

It caused the start of the production to be pushed back a few weeks later, thus conflicting with Kingsley's work schedule on Oliver Twist (2005)."", u'Steven Spielberg was going to direct this film for a 2003 or 2004 release, but shelved it when Tom Cruise became available, so the duo could work on War of the Worlds (2005) instead.', u'After getting the rights to George Jonas\' book ""Vengeance"", Steven Spielberg commissioned three scripts: one from David Webb Peoples and Janet Peoples, one from Charles Randolph, and one from Eric Roth. Roth\'s script was chosen and subsequently revised by Tony Kushner, after Kushner first declined to co-write the screenplay. He felt it was too controversial and too complicated to be his first screenplay for a feature film.', u'The quote that Papa shares with Avner when telling him that he is being hunted is loosely taken from Ecclesiastes 9:11: ""I returned and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour to men of skill; but time and chance happen to them all.""', u'To create the blue pastel effect in the Beirut scenes, special Fuji film stocks were used exclusively. The notable challenge for that was that it has to be processed in a Fuji lab (in this case in France) since most Technicolor labs use Kodak calibrations and a reprint is required if there was a case of a print printed to the wrong specifications.', u'The film was not shot in Munich or Germany at all. The Munich scenes were mostly shot in Budapest, Hungary.', u'A crew truck imported from Germany and laden with heavy equipment, mysteriously caught fire during shooting in Malta, sparking fears of a possible terrorist attack.

A short sequence of notes, repeated used as a signal to the audience. The tripods use a long, drawn out, low tone (like a foghorn), followed by a higher pitch (sounding like an orchestra), as a way of communicating to other tripods (as it was in the book). The two notes are similar to the two notes used in Jaws (1975). As in different attacks in the movie, like the beginning of the Hudson Ferry attack, it announces to the audience that something is about to happen (again, like in Jaws (1975)). In that scene, it seems to mean ""Come here, other tripods, I\'ve found a bunch of humans."" As a counter-example, though, the same tones are used at the end of the ""aliens in the basement"" scene, and seem to mean a rallying signal, as in ""everyone, report back to your posts"", as the aliens immediately leave.

The line was also used in the infamous 1938 Orson Welles radio broadcast. In addition, the news reporter\'s line, ""Once they begin to move, no more news comes out of that area"", is taken directly from The War of the Worlds (1953).

Chief Anderton (Tom Cruise) rolls a red ball along a table to demonstrate the law of cause and effect to Detective Witwer (Colin Farrell). All of this is an allusion to the famous claim of philosopher David Hume (1711-1776), that by observing billiard balls you can actually demonstrate that cause and effect does not exist but is merely a habitually created fiction of the mind.', u'For the scene where Anderton holds his breath in the bathtub, Steven Spielberg was going to create the air bubble rising with CGI, but Tom Cruise took the time and learned how to do it himself.', u""Tom Cruise and Steven Spielberg both agreed to waive their usual salary to help keep the film's budget under 100 million dollars.

Artificial Intelligence (2001) instead and have the ""Minority Report"" script reworked. According to reports, Tom Cruise\'s co-stars in that version would have been Cate Blanchett as Agatha, Matt Damon as Witwer, Ian McKellen as Burgess and Jenna Elfman as Lara Anderton. After the delay, Javier Bardem has stated in interviews that he was offered the part of Witwer, but turned it down because he ""didn\'t want to just run around chasing Tom Cruise.""

The main character was also changed to Douglas Quaid, the man played by Arnold Schwarzenegger. The project eventually fell apart but the writers, who still owned the rights to the original story, rewrote the script, removing the elements from ""Total Recall"". This script was eventually tossed out when writer Jon Cohen was hired in 1997 to start the project over from scratch. The only original element from the early script which made it to the final film is the sequence in the car factory, an idea that Steven Spielberg loved.', u'Lexus reputedly paid five million dollars to have a futuristic version of one of its cars in the film.

The data was double-checked by the military to ensure that the Pre-Crime officers would not be bribed by any future murderer to conceal the evidence. The Pre-Cogs worked on different time levels which accounted for any minor discrepancies that their premonitions had. They mumbled and their incoherent words were deciphered in audio tapes.

This is in fact the choice Burgess makes in the original short story. Burgess at first realizes that the precogs prediction was wrong, and is able to choose not to commit the murder. However, when his would-be victim announces his intention to publicize this fact to discredit precrime, Burgess decides to kill him anyway--thus apparently proving the precogs correct and preserving the system he believes in.', u'On February 18th, 2016, iO9 posted a video on the movie titled ""Is The Ending To Minority Report One Giant Deception?"" which theorizes that everything that happens after Anderton is apprehended for Leo Crow and Danny Witwer\'s murders and haloed at Lara\'s house is not real and it is a dream that is happening in Anderton\'s mind and that he is still in stasis at the PreCrime prison.', u""Similarities to The Fugitive (1993): 1.

The text of the poem appears in the movie in two places, and certain stanzas take on literal meaning as well (e.g. ""Till the moon has taken flight""). There are also many surprising similarities to the Philip K.

John Williams thought the music fit perfectly with the way the scene was shot by Steven Spielberg.', u'As a promotional tool, the creators developed an elaborate internet game of discovery and problem solving, through hidden messages and puzzles in internet sites, telephone answering messages, e-mail accounts and clues in the film\'s trailers.

In '2001, a Space Odyssey,' the only women are servers and secretaries. In 'AI,' he imagines three wheeled pod cars (still driven by humans, which probably won't be the case in the future shown in the film), but people in this future are still using land line phones."", u'The screenplay ""borrows"" liberally from Osamu Tezuka\'s 1952 manga Tetsuwan Atomu (known as Astro Boy in the English speaking world), in which a scientist creates an emotion-capable boy robot to replace his dead son, but becomes frustrated when he realizes the robot will never grow up or become human.

The two collaborated for years, resulting in Kubrick giving Spielberg a complete treatment and lots of conceptual art for the film prior to his death. Even the much-criticized ending, that many viewers assumed was an addition that Spielberg had insisted on, was a part of Kubrick\'s original treatment.', u'There are no shots of David blinking until the end, when he is perceived as a real boy.', u'Although implied by the film, John Williams confirmed that David does indeed die in the very last scene of the film.', u'After Joe finds Samantha dead, he says that the number of seconds since the last time they met is 255,133, which is 2 days, 22 hours, 52 minutes and 13 seconds.', u""The elaborate series of promotional websites included information about the characters' lives after their last appearances in the film.

The next scene shows Miller and the others walking through a meadow on foot with no vehicle in sight. This is due to the fact that the scene which shows how Miller and the men lose the Jeep was deleted from the final cut. Later in the film, Miller mentions something about losing ""most of their ammo.""

However, recent research disproves these rumors (Joseph Yannielli, ""Cinque the Slave Trader: Some New Evidence on an Old Controversy"", Common-Place, Vol. 10, October 2009). It is believed that Cinque, and the other freed prisoners from the Amistad, returned to Africa in 1842, at which time, Cinque\'s home country of Sierra Leone was being torn apart by civil war. Cinque and his companions from the Amistad kept in contact with members from the local Christian mission, and this contact provides today\'s researchers with pieces of information regarding his later life. After a while, Cinque left the area to trade along the coast of West Africa. Most stories of his later life are simply rumor. George Thompson\'s ""Thompson in Africa: or, An account of the missionary labors, sufferings..."" (1852) puts forward the idea that Cinque had moved to Jamaica. Others held that he had become a merchant, or a chief, perhaps trading in slaves. However, this rumor of Cinque engaging in the slave trade has been seriously disputed. The origin of these claims appears to be statements made by early twentieth century Author William A.

While the Jurassic Park movies depict the T-Rex as an active hunter, the question whether the T-Rex was a predator or a poacher/scavenger has been (and still is) the subject of a decades-long debate. Opponents of the predator theory maintain that a T-Rex\'s arms were too short to hold down a prey, and that it would not have been able to run as fast as its prey due to its bulk; additionally, its excellent sense of smell would serve to sniff already dead prey over large distances. Supporters of the predator theory point at the fact that T-Rexes had depth perception, a trait seen mainly in predators so that they can estimate the distance to their prey. Also, fossilized skeletons of other dinosaurs have been found with healed bite marks from T-Rexes on them, which would indicate that a T-Rex had hunted them while they were alive rather than dead.', u'Steven Spielberg originally approached Juliette Binoche about playing the role of Sarah Harding.

Conceptual artist for the first three films, Mark ""Cash"" McCreery had previously expressed in the Jurassic Park Topps trading cards his regret That stegosaurus was not among the dinosaurs that appeared in Jurassic Park. As Colin Wilson recalled, ""Steven made that his mission- to come up with a really good stegosaurus sequence"" two animatronic stegosauruses were created for the film, one was an adult whose maquettes an animatronic were created by a five-person team headed by Mark Maitre and Scott Stoddard with Al Sousa and Kirk Skodis being in charge of the mechanical armature of the animatronic. The second animatronic was the juvenile stegosaurus ""Claire"" whose animatronic was sculpted and painted by Dave Grasso and mechanized by Bob Mano.', u'Despite concept art and one of the maquettes of the adult Stegosaurus depicting it with its tail dragging like older restorations the stegosaurs in this film and the following sequel lacked this trait, although the stegosaurus in Jurassic world would feature it briefly dragging its tail along with a Triceratops that did the same.like with the Pachycephalosaurus which appears in the movie also with stegosaurus, the stegosaurus went through many changes in terms of its coloration. Mark Maitre was responsible for creating a total of six of these conceptual skin colorations.', u'Both Stegosaur animatronics were transported to Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park in California for the filming of the stegosaurus skirmish.The juvenile animatronic was the only practical Stegosaur that was filmed as Steven Spielberg, Stan Winston, and stunt coordinator Gary Hymes agreed that stunts with the adult Stegosaur animatronic would be potentially dangerous- particularly because of its spike tail- and filming with the adult was rescheduled for one of the stages of Universal Studios feeling these stunts would be safer inside a controlled environment. ultimately, almost all the shots of the adult stegosaurus were created in CGI with the animatronic only being used in close-up shots, such as the caged stegosaur that Nick and Sarah approach when infiltrating the camp of the InGen hunters.', u'The sounds of the Pachycephalosaurus consisted of several vocalizations with some sounding much aggressive or ominously threatening, the vocals are portrayed as raspy or blunt consisting of squawks or bleats from both vultures, sheep, goats and moans from a camel and rhino.', u'The vocalizations for the juvenile tyrannosaur were of a baby camel crying for its mother.', u'Interestingly, in the script for the Lost World Jurassic Park the identity of Pachycephalosaur captured by the hunters was more vague as Burke initially identifies it as Pachycephalosaurus but later afterwards identifies the animal as either once again being Pachycephalosaurus or Prenocephale.', u'The pactical effect of the Pachycephalosaurus was sculpted and painted by Scott Stoddard and was mechanized by Jeff Edwards and Rich Haugen. there were three versions that were created and employed for use in the film, these three variants were a full size hydraulic puppet, an insert head, an animatronic of the Pachy in a ramming stance when it headbutts one of the vehicles of the hunters, also to know is that the Pachycephalosaurus was the only dinosaur in the round up scene that was not purely portrayed with CGI.', u'Pteranodon was ultimately chosen instead of the novels Cearadactylus probably because of its larger size, more spectacular/impressive appearance and massive popularity with audiences.', u'The screech the Pteranodon makes at the end was made by Gary Rydstrom slowing down the sound of him taking out tooth floss from his box.', u'This film saw the introduction of male Raptors with a different color scheme than those of the ones before and the female seen in the film. Stan Winston explained the reasoning behind the new color schemes of the Raptors and other dinosaurs by saying ""we had to design new paint schemes not only for the new dinosaurs, but for some of the already designed dinosaurs from the last movie, because now there were male dinosaurs, as well as females and typically in nature, the males of any species are far more brightly colored. We also wanted to make sure the audience would be able to tell the males and females apart."" the final coloration that was chosen for the male velociraptor was a tiger-like color scheme devised by Chris Swift.', u'The scene where the the female Tyrannosaur pokes her head through the waterfall to find the humans that are hiding from her and licks Sarah Harding is taken from the chapter ""Tyrannosaur"" of the Jurassic Park novel when Rexy does the same to Tim Murphy.

In reality, it would not be likely that the second trailer could hold the weight of the first trailer; once the engine went over, the rest would easily be pulled over. However, it is possible that the first trailer was much, much lighter than an average RV, due to its electric engine, lightly built design. Also Eddie goes through the first trailer with a rope to send down to Ian, Sarah, and Nick; however, he travels through the accordion-connector, which is essentially impossible. When the second trailer is flipped by the rexes, the connector would be twisted shut like in the novel, yet Carr is able to easily climb through the passage and toss the rope down.', u'The dependence of young Tyrannosaurus on their parents is very apparent with this baby dinosaur. When it is injured and taken away from its parents, it barely ever stops howling for them, indicating that it is not yet capable of surviving on its own and requires its parents to come to its rescue.', u'For the vocalizations of the male tyrannosaur, pigs and ""weird Costa Rican mammals"",were used mammals that Gary Rydstrom and his team recorded but never knew what their identities were, had a similar screech like the baby elephant used for the females and were used in place of the latter. The original T. rex roars from Jurassic Park (1993) were also reused for the female tyrannosaur', u'Steven Spielberg: Reflected in the TV broadcasting the CNN story about the return of the dinosaurs, sitting on the couch next to Jeff Goldblum and eating popcorn.', u'Steven Spielberg: [Signs] Using a sign with directions or instructions as a joke. In this case, the T-Rex crosses the pier at the San Diego port bearing a sign that reads, ""No animals or vegetables beyond this point.""', u""Steven Spielberg: [father] Malcolm admits he's a bad father."", u'The script called for a scene where the Velociraptors got on board the Venture as it was about to set sail. As chaos ensued, the T-Rex also got loose, and killed everything else aboard. This explains why many of the crew members are dead in places the Rex cannot reach. The scene was never filmed.', u'In the novel of ""Jurassic Park"", the characters of both John Hammond and Ian Malcolm died (though Malcolm returned in the novel ""The Lost World"" (1997), explaining that ""The doctors did excellent work.""). In the film version, however, both characters survived, allowing them to return in this movie.', u'There are 13 on-camera deaths, 10 on the island and 3 in the city, the second of all three films. Jurassic World has taken first for 25 deaths.', u'The closing scene of this film, a view of the dinosaurs living undisturbed on the island, includes pterosaurs. They were considered for action sequences in both of the first two films, but these were abandoned, making this brief clip their first onscreen appearance. They featured prominently in the first novel, in a sequence that took place in a pterosaur aviary; this was finally realized in Jurassic Park III (2001), and revisited in Jurassic World (2015).', u'David Koepp lifted several set pieces from the original Jurassic Park novel for use in this sequel. These include: The Procompsognathuses (compys) attacking the young girl; hiding from the T-rex behind a waterfall, while the creature tries to find them using its tongue; Dieter Stark being killed by Procompsognathids (compys) (Hammond in the novel); Roland Tembo tranquilizing the T-rex (Robert Muldoon in the novel).', u""It's curious that Roland wishes to hunt the male/buck Tyrannosaurus, when the female Tyrannosaurus is actually larger. This could possibly stem from the fact that Roland is a professional hunter, and in sport hunting it is the male that is usually prized for its size and adornment. Roland may not have known that it is the female that holds the size."", u""Dr Malcolm accuses Peter Ludlow in the mansion of lying about the facts surrounding the deaths of 3 people during the course of events in the first film. In fact, four people died in the first film: Ray Arnold (Samuel L. Jackson'), Robert Muldoon (Bob Peck), Donald Gennaro (Martin Ferrero) and Dennis Nedry (Wayne Knight); five if you include the worker at the beginning who is killed by the velociraptor. However, the worker's death already occurred before the main events of the first movie (it was the reason why a team of experts was sent to Jurassic Park in the first place), so Ludlow could not have lied about it. None of the characters could have known of Nedry's fate since he absconded with the eggs early on, and his death was not witnessed, so his status is most likely 'missing, presumed dead'."", u""In Michael Crichton's novel, the opposing group on the island is not led by Peter Ludlow (who does not exist in either novel), but rather by Lewis Dodgson, head of the rival company BioSyn, who had hired Dennis Nedry in the previous film. Dodgson hides from the T-Rex under a Jeep with Sarah Harding, who kicks him out to lead the T-Rex away. The T-Rex takes him home to its nest to feed to its young. This is closely paralleled by the fate of Ludlow in the film."", u'The S.S. Venture, which transports the Tyrannosaurus to San Diego, is a reference to King Kong, who was transported to New York City on a ship called the S.S. Venture.', u'If you look closely, the face of the male/buck Tyrannosaurus is adorned with many facial scars and many of the teeth in his mouth are missing or broken.

It would have been too long for it to be that old, although it's implied that InGen accelerated the growth of their dinosaurs which could account for the issue."", u'The tranquilizer gun Roland uses to tranqulize the male Tyrannosaur is a LAR Grizzly Big Boar.', u'The car Ian Malcolm drives, is a 1969 Pontiac custom S.', u'Due to a recent discovery of specimens of juvenile T-rexes, it is possible that infant T-rexes actually had longer skulls, therefore making the infant T-rex in this movie unrealistic. However, the dinosaurs in the Jurassic Park novels and films were genetically engineered by splicing together DNA from several different sources, as was explained in the first book and movie. Therefore, the appearances of all of the dinosaurs, would be dependent upon their respective genetic makeup.', u'Originally, the baby T-rex was suppose to be brown, as seen on one of his marquettes in the behind-the-scenes featurette, meaning that he might have originally been planned to be female instead of male.', u'There\'s concept art that exists for the Lost World that depicts a T-rex with a brownish skin color in a cage being hauled away, though the ILM website states that the concept art is for the first film, the concept art can be proven to actually come from this film due to the bottom right corner of the artwork having the words ""Lost World"", and because the T-Rex in the concept art is in a cage but is brown instead of green like the male T-Rex ""Buck"" who is captured in the film, this could suggest that the female T-rex ""Doe"" was originally going to be the T-Rex brought to San Diego instead of the male ""Buck"" or that both Tyrannosaurus were to be captured.', u'The hunters use Dan Inject Dartguns to capture the dinosaurs.', u""The arrival of Ian Malcolm's daughter seems to come as a surprise to him and it also seems that until her surprise appearance on the island, no contingency had been put in place for her care.""]","[u'USA::19 May 1997 (Los Angeles, California)\n (premiere)', u'USA::23 May 1997', u'Australia::29 May 1997', u'Singapore::5 June 1997', u'Philippines::10 June 1997', u'Colombia::13 June 1997', u'South Korea::14 June 1997', u'Brazil::20 June 1997', u'Argentina::26 June 1997', u'Hong Kong::26 June 1997', u'New Zealand::26 June 1997', u'Mexico::27 June 1997', u'South Africa::27 June 1997', u'Japan::12 July 1997', u'UK::18 July 1997', u'Ireland::18 July 1997', u'Israel::18 July 1997', u'Iceland::18 July 1997', u'China::7 August 1997', u'Germany::7 August 1997', u'Switzerland::8 August 1997', u'Spain::22 August 1997', u'Serbia::27 August 1997 (Belgrade)', u'Slovenia::28 August 1997', u'Republic of Macedonia::4 September 1997', u'Finland::5 September 1997', u'Italy::5 September 1997', u'Norway::5 September 1997', u'Poland::5 September 1997', u'Estonia::12 September 1997', u'France::12 September 1997 (Deauville Film Festival)', u'Denmark::19 September 1997', u'Sweden::19 September 1997', u'Turkey::19 September 1997', u'Kuwait::24 September 1997', u'Czech Republic::25 September 1997', u'Hungary::25 September 1997', u'Netherlands::25 September 1997', u'Portugal::26 September 1997', u'Luxembourg::17 October 1997', u'Belgium::22 October 1997', u'France::22 October 1997', u'Czech Republic::6 December 2004 (DVD premiere)']",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

He later called it one of the hardest times in his life as a filmmaker: the filming of the Holocaust-themed Schindler's List took such an emotional toll on him, that his enthusiasm for Jurassic Park had almost waned. He said that he needed an hour per day to get into the right frame of mind, and muster up the energy, and patience, to comment on digital dinosaurs, and answer trivial questions from the special effects crew."", u""All of the cast were given a Raptor model, signed by Steven Spielberg as a gift. It looked very frightening, and Ariana Richards has it in her house to shock anyone coming in, like a guard at the gate. Jeff Goldblum's model has a prime spot in his house and is a cherished object.

He is, however, the only cast member of the original film to reprise his role in the fourth film, Jurassic World (2015).', u'Dennis Muren suggested most of the full size dinosaurs could be done on computer from head to toe, but he had to prove it first to Steven Spielberg, which he did with a skeletal Gallimimus herd running through a field. Spielberg was so blown away by the scene, especially when a fleshy T-Rex arrived on the scene; he and Tippett looked at each other and Tippett said, ""I think we\'re extinct"". Spielberg liked the line and gave it to Jeff Goldblum to say to Sam Neill in the Visitor\'s Centre.', u'In 2005, paleontologist Dr. Mary Schweitzer discovered red blood cells and soft tissue in the fossilized bones of a T-Rex, meaning dinosaur cloning may become a reality someday.', u'While discussing chaos theory, Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) shamelessly flirts with Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern). After meeting on this film, the two began a romantic relationship, and were engaged for two years before breaking up.', u'The most difficult effect to pull off was the vibrating rings of water. Steven Spielberg wanted the T-Rex to announce its presence somehow before the audience saw it, and got the idea from watching the mirror in his car vibrate because of the sound effects. When Michael Lantieri tried to replicate that with water, it was harder than any of the dinosaur effects; nobody knew how to do it but told Spielberg they could. The night before the shoot, Lantieri put a glass of water on a guitar and when he plucked the strings, that did it. So for the scene, they fed guitar strings under the dashboard to get the effect.', u""The sound of the T-Rex's footsteps were created by cut sequoias crashing to the ground."", u'Ariana Richards\' audition consisted of standing in front of a camera and screaming wildly.

Upon seeing Jurassic Park, Cameron realized that Spielberg was the better choice to direct it as his version would\'ve been much more violent (""Aliens (1986) with dinosaurs"") which ""wouldn\'t have been fair"" to children, who relate to dinosaurs. The special effects were directly influenced by Cameron\'s Terminator 2 (1991).', u""The Dilophosaurus's venom-spitting and neck-frill became so iconic that almost every other appearance of the animal in popular media, as well as most of the Dilophosaurus children's toys advertise at least one or both of these aspects. Some even leave out the dinosaur's striking double-crests. In reality, however, the spitting ability was only made up by Michael Crichton, while adding the frill was Steven Spielberg's idea. Real Dilophosaurus possessed neither of these traits, with the twin crests and its thin jaws (the latter of which isn't very evident in the movie's design) being its real discerning features."", u""Shortly after Nedry makes his first appearance in the control room, during his argument with Hammond, one can clearly see Jaws (1975) playing in a small video window on one of Nedry's computer screens.

In fact, this is how Malcolm behaves in the scene as written in the book. When the time came to film the scene, it was Jeff Goldblum's idea to make his flight more heroic, by having him distract the Tyrannosaur so Grant could save the children."", u'During the scenes with the T-Rex, Steven Spielberg would roar like one through the megaphone. The cast cracked up whenever he did that.', u""When the audience first saw the T-Rex, Steven Spielberg wanted it from inside the cars so the audience feels like they're experiencing it right there with the characters and feeling their fear."", u'Steven Spielberg liked the dinosaurs to do things behavioral that had nothing to do with the plot, like stopping to scratch, something he learned on E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982).', u'The Dilophosaurus never walks because it was difficult to get the weight shifting and the movement right. A trench was cut into the floor of the set for the puppeteers but Steven Spielberg elected to have it just appear instead to make the scene more ominous and surprising. He also wanted more water for the scene coming down the hillside with every fire hydrant going in the studio until they ran out. Michael Lantieri joked every now and then ""just splash him with something so he feels there\'s more water"". To this day, Spielberg still feels that scene needed more water. Wayne Knight thought it a miserable scene to shoot; sliding down things, covered in mud, soaking wet, he was 327 pounds, and he could barely walk, but he loved watching it.', u""The Triceratops dung didn't smell at all; it was made of clay, mud and straw. It was drizzled in honey and papayas so flies would swarm near it."", u'Michael Crichton said that his views on science and genetic engineering are largely expressed by Ian Malcolm. Steven Spielberg saw many parallels to himself in the character of John Hammond. Fittingly, he cast a fellow filmmaker in the role, who begins his tour of the park by showing a film, in which he also acts. While Malcolm is dressed entirely in black, Hammond wears all white.', u'Steven Spielberg wanted the dinosaurs to be birdlike, e.g. snapping to attention like a chicken. He wanted the Raptors to turn their heads so they could look behind them to make them have a scarier appearance.

In the book, he tells Ellie Sattler that he only ever dresses in black and gray, so that he never has to waste time thinking about what to wear. Seth Brundle (Jeff Goldblum) gives the same reason for his monotonous fashion sense in The Fly (1986), an idea that Brundle got from Albert Einstein.', u'When the Utahraptor was discovered right before the film\'s release, which had a similar height to the Raptors depicted in the film, Stan Winston joked, ""We made it, then they discovered it"".', u""In this film, Steven Spielberg directs the man who beat him to the Best Director Oscar in 1983 (Richard Attenborough, whose film Gandhi (1982) also beat Spielberg's E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982) as Best Picture)."", u""Michael Crichton estimated that the screenplay has about ten to twenty percent of the novel's content."", u'Joseph Mazzello did the freezer scene on his birthday. The Raptor was on wheels and had to be pushed, and the claws hit Mazzello on the forehead. He fell to the floor dizzy but was OK. Steven Spielberg had the whole crew sing ""Happy Birthday"" so Mazzello considered it his birthday present.', u""The kitchen scene was Ariana Richards' favorite scene; it was filmed in two weeks with Raptors there most of the time, and a man in a suit some of the time. Anyone in a Raptor suit could only do it for up to 15 minutes, because they were bent over in a downhill skiing position which is very physical. The Raptor clicking its toenails was done with a puppeteer walking on Raptor legs."", u'After making this movie, Ariana Richards developed a great interest in dinosaurs and assisted Jack Horner - paleontologist, advisor for the film, and the inspiration for the character of Dr. Grant - on an actual dinosaur dig in Montana the following summer.', u'After Joseph Mazzello was turned down for the role of Jack Banning in Steven Spielberg\'s Hook (1991) for being too young, Spielberg told Mazzello that he was still impressed with his audition and would try to cast him in a future project. Mazzello was then cast as Tim in this movie. As Mazzello recalls, ""Steven had me screen-test with Robin Williams and Dustin Hoffman for Hook. I was just too young for the role. And because of that, Steven came up to me and said, \'Don\'t worry about it, Joey. I\'m going to get you in a movie this summer.\' Not only a nice promise to get, but to have it be one of the biggest box-office smashes of all time? That\'s a pretty good trade."" Mazzello\'s casting led Spielberg to reverse the ages of the children, as he decided that casting a girl younger than Mazzello would be too young to be placed in danger. Lex was therefore made the older child, and the computer expert as well. In Michael Crichton\'s original novel, Tim is older, and is both the dinosaur and computer enthusiast.', u'A baby triceratops was built for a scene where one of the kids rides it. Special effects technicians worked on this effect for a year but the scene was cut at the last minute as Steven Spielberg thought it would ruin the pacing of the film. A similar scene, however, was later used in Jurassic World (2015).', u'Ariana Richards was upset by the fact that an action figure of her character was not produced. (Kenner only made dolls of Grant, Sattler, Muldoon, Nedry, Tim, and eventually Malcolm.)', u'All the merchandise (t-shirts, stuffed dinosaurs, lunch boxes, flasks, etc.) shown in the film were, in some part, actually created to be sold with the movie.', u'The electric vehicles in the film are Ford Explorers, but in the novel, they were Toyotas; Steven Spielberg managed to get seven for the film. The Explorers were modified to create the illusion of automation by hiding the driver in the trunk. The Jeeps were also customized for the shoot. Universal Studios Japan has a replica of one of the Ford Explorers from the movie.', u""Except for some very brief glimpses in the opening scene, the adult velociraptors - often cited as the most memorable dinosaurs in this film - don't make an on-screen appearance until over 103 minutes into the movie."", u'Generally speaking, any shot of a full dinosaur was computer-generated, but shots of parts of dinosaurs were of animatronics.', u'Grossed 402 million dollars in the U.S., and just over one billion dollars worldwide. Steven Spielberg made 250 million dollars from the film; the largest sum any individual has made from a film.', u""Michael Crichton wrote the novel in 1990, but he first got the idea in 1981. Crichton wasn't sure how to plausibly bring dinosaurs back to life until he learned about insects in amber preserving their DNA, which was the breakthrough he had been looking for. He later learned the idea is hypothetically possible. A weevil, containing dinosaur blood from more than 65 million years (125-135) ago was discovered in amber. But DNA quickly breaks down in an insect, which is why Jurassic Park's dinosaurs are more fictional."", u'Phil Tippett became quite depressed when he learned that none of the stop-motion creatures he had been developing would be used in the film. However, shortly after that decision had been made, ILM animators discovered they did actually have a use for him. While none of his stop-motion models would be seen in the film, his techniques were determined to be quite useful in animating the computer-generated dinosaurs, especially given how much research he had put into animal movement. Rather than creating the dinosaur motion using key-frame animation, it was decided to build a stop-motion armature for each computer generated dinosaur and manipulate it as they would for a stop-motion film. These armatures were specially built with motion-sensors, and linked up to the animated dinosaurs being created on the computer. Thus, the motion of the stop-motion armature was directly translated into the computer-generated version that appears in the final film.', u'In the 3-D version, Steven Spielberg claimed adding leaves to the Jeep chase took the excitement from a seven to a nine.', u""The last element to make the dinosaurs real was sound. They had to guess what they sounded like because vocal cords wouldn't survive to the present, so Steven Spielberg instructed Gary Rydstrom to make them sound like animals; real, but big and deep. Rydstrom recorded different animals and then pieced them together. The Dilophosaurus was a swan call with a hawk, a rattlesnake and a howler monkey. Raptors were dolphins, a walrus and geese that when blended sounded horrific. These sounds were put onto a computer and then played through a keyboard. Rydstrom's favorite scene was when the T-Rex ate a Gallimimus, and it looks up one last time, either to beg for mercy or just to see what's got him; Rydstrom likened it to a dog playing with a chew-toy. As it happens, the T-Rex and the Gallimimus vocals were performed by Rydstrom's Jack Russell terrier, Buster."", u'Briefly held the box office record until it was beaten by Titanic (1997).', u""The storm overpowering the park has been read into as the film's theme of trying and failing to control nature."", u'Steven Spielberg delayed the beginning of filming by several weeks to get the cast he wanted.

The lush resort made it an ideal setting but after three weeks filming, Hurricane Iniki came to Kauai, and the crew were asked by the hotel to pack their suitcases, fill their bathtubs in case of a power or water shortage, and to pack a day bag and meet in the hotel ballroom, on the basement level. By 9:00 a.m., the storm hit. Kathleen Kennedy ensured the movie crew had generators for lights and plenty of food and water. They had to be self-sustaining because they moved around on location all the time. They had to camp out in rows of chaise longues on the ballroom floor, while the cast and crew heard winds pick up at 4:00 p.m., and rumble by the hotel at nearly 120 miles per hour. Kennedy likened it to a freight train roaring past. Iniki struck all the sets, leaving no working phones or power on Kauai, so at dawn, Kennedy jogged to the airport to explore their options, where all the windows were blown out in the terminals, and it was full of palm trees, sand, and water. Kennedy hitched a lift to Honolulu on a Salvation Army plane and began organizing from a pay phone.

The screenplay and movie never came to fruition. Originally, Crichton\'s novel was rejected by his ""people"", a group of about five or six personal acquaintances, who always read his drafts before he sends them off. After several rejections, Crichton finally figured out what was wrong: he had originally intended for the story to be through the eyes of a child who was at the park when the dinosaurs escaped, which his peers felt was too ridiculous, and could not identify with the character. Crichton re-wrote the story as it is today, and it became a huge hit. (The story also incorporates the ""amusement park run amok"" element of Crichton\'s earlier screenplay Westworld (1973).)', u'Before Steven Spielberg decided to use animatronic dinosaurs and computer graphics imagery, he wanted to use stop motion animation for the dinosaur effects and had Phil Tippett put together a short demo of the kitchen scene using claymation dinosaurs (Barbie dolls were substituted for the actual actors).', u""In the scene where the survivors are crawling through vent spaces, the computer monitors are shining on the raptor after them.

She recalled shooting the scene, where the actors were looking at an X on a piece of paper. Grant loses the power in his legs because Sam Neill thought seeing something so mind boggling would make you faint. When Steven Spielberg first edited the scene, the temp music was the St. Crispin\'s Day speech from Kenneth Branagh\'s Henry V (1989). Phil Tippett thought it perfect and said ""you did it, you crazy son of a bitch"", not knowing that was a line from the movie.', u'The Triceratops scene was a major operation. Most of the dinosaur scenes were shot on sound-stages, but Steven Spielberg wanted this scene shot on location in Hawaii. The puppeteers loved this decision because the dust and the dirt tied it into the environment. It was also the first dinosaur the actors saw; they were blown away by its realism. Stan Winston\'s team dug a hole beneath the puppet and eight puppeteers below operated cables and push-rods. The backside of the Triceratops had a door with three or four men inside. The only one of the actors not impressed was Joseph Mazzello because the first dinosaur he got to see up close didn\'t do anything.

The second scene done in that same vein was the Gallimimus scene, which made use of 25 animated individual Gallimimuses. Geometric shapes represented them initially and were choreographed onto the scene. Spielberg needed complete freedom to convey the energy of the scene, so worked with Dennis Muren to shoot it, because he wanted to move the camera and not lock it down everytime a Gallimimus came into frame.

He is portrayed as being very short, as well as cold, egotistical, hot tempered, and manipulative, using his grandchildren to soften Gennaro, and completely neglecting them when they go missing.

He told everyone he lost it in a coaching accident and no one had any reason to doubt his story until a man named Smith came into town and revealed he lost it in his previous career as a pirate. Apparently, Maher had a pretty successful career as a swashbuckler until he decided to strand his partner (Smith) in the Caribbean, relocate to Brede and become a man of the cloth. Eventually, Smith tracked down his old friend and set out to blackmail him with his own past.

(Chapter 2: The Shadow)When Tinker Bell is first trying to get Peter to remember her, she says, ""I drank poison for you!"" This is a direct reference to the events in Chapter 13: Do You Believe in Fairies.The invisible dinner sequence is inspired by the lines in the book: ""The difference between (Peter) and the other boys at such a time was that they knew it was make-believe, while to him make-believe and true were exactly the same thing. This sometimes troubled them, as when they had to make-believe that they had had their dinners."" from Chapter 6: The Little HouseAfter human-sized Tinkerbell kisses Peter, and he remembers he has to save his children, Tink says to him, ""You silly ass, Go!""

Barrie book. Among them are: ""When the first baby laughed for the first time, the laugh broke into a thousands pieces and they went skipping about. That was the beginning of fairies."" In the film this is recited by Granny Wendy and Maggie Banning. In the book it is spoken by Peter to Wendy. (Chapter 3: Come Away, Come Away!)""I can\'t come with you. I have forgotten how to fly. I\'m old, Peter. Ever so much more than twenty. I grew up a long time ago."" The line is spoken by an aged Wendy to Peter in both the film and book.""Strike, Peter. Strike true."" In the film this is spoken by a defeated Hook to Peter. In the book it is spoken by a guilty Tootles to Peter in Chapter 6: The Little House.When Peter and his family arrive in London at the start of the film, Peter tells his Children ""first impressions are the most important"". In the book, Peter tells the lost boys ""Look your best, first impressions are awfully important"" when they first enter the house they built for Wendy in Chapter 6: The little House.When Peter confronts Hook for the final battle at the end of the film, they say: ""Peter Pan, prepare to meet thy doom."" ""Dark and sinister man, have at thee."" This exchange is almost directly lifted from the book, Chapter 15: Hook or Me This Time, the original line being: ""Proud and insolent youth, prepare to meet thy doom."" ""Dark and sinister man, have at thee.""During the duel between Peter and Hook, Hook says ""Thus perished Peter Pan"". This is a flip of the original line ""Thus perished Jas. Hook"", which is from Chapter 15: Hook or Me This Time. Peter\'s line in the movie ""to live will be an awfully big adventure"" refers to a line in the book where Hook says: ""to die will be an awfully big adventure"" in Chapter 8: the Mermaid\'s Lagoon. This line from the book is also reflected in the scene where Hook tries to commit suicide when he tells Smee ""Death may be the only big adventure I have left.""']","[u'USA::8 December 1991 (Hollywood, California)\n (premiere)', u'USA::11 December 1991', u'Argentina::16 January 1992', u'Australia::26 March 1992', u'Germany::26 March 1992', u'Spain::27 March 1992', u'Italy::27 March 1992', u'Sweden::27 March 1992', u'Poland::April 1992', u'France::1 April 1992', u'Denmark::3 April 1992', u'Finland::3 April 1992', u'Portugal::3 April 1992', u'UK::7 April 1992 (London)\n (premiere)', u'Czechoslovakia::10 April 1992', u'UK::10 April 1992', u'Hungary::10 April 1992', u'Ireland::10 April 1992', u'Netherlands::10 April 1992', u'Brazil::24 April 1992', u'Turkey::15 May 1992', u'Japan::6 June 1992', u'South Korea::20 June 1992', u'Greece::18 April 2000 (DVD premiere)', u'Czech Republic::1 July 2006 (DVD premiere)']",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

This is quite correct, especially given that the knight who recovered the Grail acquired it during the First Crusade. The First Crusade ended in 1099. In the time of the Roman Empire, J was merely a variant of an I, hence the resemblance between their lower case forms i and j. The original pronunciation was very much like an I or Y. Its use as a soft g sound dates to no earlier than the fifteenth century.', u'When Henry climbs into the tank to rescue Marcus, he taps Marcus on the shoulder (scaring him in the process), after which Henry says ""Genius of the restoration..."", to which Marcus replies with ""...aid our own resuscitation!"" That particular phrase was originally an old toast that was traditionally given at the University Club in Manhattan.', u'When George Lucas met with Steven Spielberg to discuss a third Indiana Jones movie, he wanted to have it set in a haunted mansion. Spielberg had just finished Poltergeist (1982) and decided that he wanted to do something different. Lucas then came up with the idea of the Holy Grail, and Spielberg added the idea of a father and son substory.', u'In the beginning of the film when Harrison Ford is teaching his class, he says, ""If it\'s truth you\'re interested in, Dr. Tyree\'s philosophy class is right down the hall.""

Harpo Marx revealed in his autobiography, that he once actually had to smuggle a journal of important documents out of Russia, to keep them from falling into enemy hands.', u'Chris Columbus wrote a couple of drafts. His first draft, dated May 3, 1985, changed the main plot device to a Garden of Immortal Peaches. It begins in 1937, with Indiana battling the murderous ghost of Baron Seamus Seagrove III in Scotland. Indiana travels to Mozambique to aid Dr. Clare Clarke (a Katharine Hepburn type, according to George Lucas), who has found a two hundred-year-old pygmy. The pygmy is kidnapped by the Nazis during a boat chase, and Indiana, Clare, and Scraggy Brier (an old friend of Indiana) travel up the Zambezi river to rescue him. Indiana is killed in the climactic battle, but is resurrected by the Monkey King. Other characters include a cannibalistic African tribe; Nazi Sergeant Gutterbuhg, who has a mechanical arm; Betsy, a stowaway student who is suicidally in love with Indiana; and a pirate leader named Kezure (described as a Toshir\xf4 Mifune type), who dies eating a peach, because he is not pure of heart. His second draft, dated August 6, 1985, removed Betsy and featured Dash, an expatriate bar owner, for whom the Nazis work, and the Monkey King as villains. The Monkey King forces Indiana and Dash to play chess with real people, and disintegrates each person who is captured. Indiana subsequently battles the undead, destroys the Monkey King\'s rod, and marries Clare. Location scouting commenced in Africa, but Steven Spielberg and Lucas abandoned ""Monkey King"", because of its negative depiction of African natives, and because the script was too unrealistic. Spielberg acknowledged that it made him ""...feel very old, too old to direct it."" However, the tank chase sequence in the film was taken from one of his drafts. Members of the Chicago-based podcast Alcohollywood began periodically releasing an early draft of the script as an episodic audio play at the beginning of 2017.', u'As with the other Indiana Jones movies, Harrison Ford did many of his own stunts. According to Stuntman Vic Armstrong, on this movie, he had to pull Ford to one side, and ask him to let him do some work on the movie, because he was been paid to double for him, because Ford was doing so much of the action himself. Armstrong later said ""If he wasn\'t such a great actor, he would have made a really great stuntman.""', u""In the movie, the Grail is located in the Republic of Hatay, near the city of Alexandretta. There actually was a Republic of Hatay from 1938 to 1939, after the region was granted independence from French Syria, and before it became a province of Turkey. The capital of Hatay was Alexandretta before 1939, when the city's name was changed to Iskenderun and the capital moved to Antioch.

The huge indoor library shown, was filmed elsewhere.', u""When it came to filming the rat scene, the producers inquired of their insurer, Fireman's Fund, whether they were insured if the animals were for some reason indisposed, due to illness, an accident, or simply because they refused to perform. This was a delicate issue, as one lost day of filming can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, yet the experts at Fireman's Fund were able to reach a compromise which pleased both sides. They asked Spielberg what would be the least number of rats needed for a dramatic shot. If different camera angles were used, one thousand rats would probably be sufficient, came the answer. Thus Fireman's Fund underwrote the world's first insurance policy with a one thousand-rat deductible. One thousand mechanical rats were also used in the scene. To help achieve the sound of thousands of rats, Sound Designer Ben Burtt used the higher registers of thousands of chickens."", u'The production had two tanks for the tank chase scene. One of them was made of aluminum. The whole chase took about ten days to film, instead of the projected two days.', u""When Indiana's bag is caught on the gun, and is being dragged along the wall, no stuntman was used, Harrison Ford did it himself. The crew just went along with shovels, tipping dirt and clay on him, from above."", u'When Professor Jones, Sr. scares the ""seagulls"" to fly up and stop the plane, they are in fact pigeons, and not seagulls, as seagulls cannot be trained. Looking closely, one can also see that there are numerous ""cut-out"" seagulls in the sand, which do not move as the others do.', u'Denholm Elliott and John Rhys-Davies make their last appearances in the Indiana Jones franchise, as Marcus Brody and Sallah, respectively. They were brought back in this film, in order to give it a lighter tone, in contrast to the dark tone of the previous film, as well as their absences from that film. However, both characters are acknowledged in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008).', u'First Indiana Jones movie to receive a PG-13 rating by the MPAA. Although Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984) was instrumental in the development of the PG-13 rating, the MPAA only gave it a PG rating.', u'Denholm Elliott had been diagnosed with A.I.D.S. shortly before filming began, and was seriously ill on various production days.', u""The difficulties shown by the tank driver in maneuvering the vehicle were very realistic.

For the first, the blades under which Indiana ducks like a penitent man were a mix of practical and miniature blades created by Gibbs and ILM. For the second trial, in which Indiana spells ""Iehova"" on stable stepping stones, it was intended to have a tarantula crawl up Indiana after he mistakenly steps on ""J"". This was filmed and deemed unsatisfactory, so ILM filmed a stuntman hanging through a hole that appears in the floor, thirty feet above a cavern. As this was dark, it did not matter that the matte painting and models were rushed late in production. The tarantula version is used in a comic book adaptation of the movie. The third trial, the leap of faith that Indiana makes over an apparently impassable ravine, after discovering a bridge, hidden by forced perspective, was created with a model bridge and painted backgrounds. This was cheaper than building a full-size set. A puppet of Harrison Ford was used to create a shadow on the nine-foot-tall by thirteen-foot-wide model, because Ford had filmed the scene against bluescreen, which did not incorporate the shaft of light from the entrance.', u""After having a great working relationship with Steven Spielberg on Gremlins (1984), Spielberg produced the next two films Chris Columbus scripted, The Goonies (1985), based on an idea Spielberg had, and Young Sherlock Holmes (1985), which was Columbus' idea, which altogether was two years working on three films. Spielberg then wanted Columbus to script The Last Crusade, a big step for him as a writer. He accepted, and went to meet Spielberg and George Lucas, two men he was very intimidated by, even though he had worked with Spielberg three times, and they were two of his cinematic heroes. Columbus acted as Spielberg and Lucas' secretary on the film for five days, taking down all of their ideas. Lucas dictated the screenplay to Columbus, making him fearful of changing any of it, and it went against what Columbus had learned at film school. To him, the script seemed lifeless, and without energy, and there was nothing of Columbus in it. Columbus assumed Spielberg hired him for that last reason, and when Columbus turned in the script, he was fired from the picture for all the above flaws in the screenplay. It was a defining moment in Columbus' career, to never again ignore his base instincts on a movie, or to be intimidated by the people, with whom he worked."", u""Both tanks (the hero tank for full shots, and the process tank for close-ups of action) now reside at the Disney's Hollywood Studios (formerly the Disney/MGM Studios) in Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida, although the process tank is no longer on display."", u'When it was still only three Indiana Jones movies, there was a fan theory that Indiana\'s adventures, are merely a series of dreams that Han Solo is having while still frozen in carbonite. Several examples can be produced to lend some credence to this. In Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), a carving of C-3PO and R2-D2 can be seen behind Indiana in the well of souls, and when Indiana faces the swordsman in the town, he ""shoots first"". In Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984), the name of the club in Shanghai is ""Club Obi-Wan"". In this movie, the characters of Donovan and Hitler are portrayed by two actors who have also played Imperial Officers in Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980). Also, there are several sounds throughout the movies, that sound like the Millennium Falcons engines, and even sounds that were also sounds from the carbonite freezing chamber. All this could be occurring in Solo\'s mind, as a way of his subconscious trying to wake him up, or making sure he remembers people and things from his life.', u'Unable to keep his hat on during the scene where he was chasing the tank on horseback despite trying glue, tape, and newspaper wedges, Harrison Ford pretended (in a ""Making-Of"" special) to staple the hat to his head.', u""Indiana's leap from horse to tank was performed by legendary British Stuntman Vic Armstrong."", u'Harrison Ford recommended River Phoenix to play the young Indiana Jones after Phoenix had played his son in The Mosquito Coast (1986).', u'According to the address on the package he received from Italy, Indiana teaches at Barnett College. The name of the school, was adopted and more prominently used in later media (for example, Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis (1992))', u""Anthony Powell found it a challenge to create Sir Sean Connery's costume, because the script required the character to wear the same clothes throughout the movie. Powell thought about his own grandfather, and incorporated tweed suits and fishing hats.

He could not find any suitable, so he had them specially made."", u""Because steam locomotives are very loud, Michael Lantieri's crew would respond to First Assistant Director David Tomblin's radioed directions by making the giraffes nod or shake their heads to his questions, which amused the crew."", u'Amanda Redman was asked to play the female lead of Elsa, but turned it down because of her real-life fear of rats.', u""George Lucas first introduced the Holy Grail in an idea for the film's prologue, which was to be set in Scotland. He intended the Grail to have a pagan basis, with the rest of the film revolving around a separate Christian artifact in Africa. Steven Spielberg did not care for the Grail idea, which he found too esoteric, even after Lucas suggested giving it healing powers, and the ability to grant immortality."", u'It is quite fitting that the city built on the ruins of Alexandretta should be called Iskenderun. Like many other cities he conquered, Alexandretta was named for Alexander the Great. Translated into Arabic, Alexander would be Al-Iskenderun. By itself, ""al"" translated as ""the,"" hence it would be omitted from the name of a city.', u'The idea of an airplane being carried by an airship was actually taken from the U.S. Navy airships U.S.S. Akron and U.S.S. Macon. Each airship, slightly smaller than the Zeppelin shown in the movie, actually had a trapeze (also known as a ""sky hook"") under the belly of the airship, and hangar space inside for up to four small planes. The planes were intended to act as scouts, that used the airship as a flying aircraft carrier. The builders of the Hindenburg also attempted, with help from the Navy, to install a similar trapeze on the Hindenburg shortly before her disastrous last flight in 1937. The idea was for the small plane to act as a mail courier. However, the pilot was unable to ""hook on"" to the trapeze consistently, the experiment was abandoned, and the trapeze was removed from the Hindenburg before she departed for her final flight. In The Great Waldo Pepper (1975), the character of Kessler was based on that pilot, World War I German ace General Ernst Udet.', u'Steven Spielberg included the opening scenes as a tribute to his own experiences as a Boy Scout.', u'Due to his commitment to the film, Steven Spielberg had to drop out of directing Big (1988) and Rain Man (1988).', u""Harrison Ford (Indiana Jones) and Pat Roach (Gestapo) are the only actors to appear in the first three films. Roach played Giant Sherpa and First Mechanic in Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), and Chief Guard in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984). A scene was filmed where Indiana Jones knocks him unconscious aboard the zeppelin, extending a running joke in the series of Ford's character knocking down Roach's characters in every movie. However, the scene was not used in the final cut, so the only presence of Roach remaining in the movie is the shot of him running behind Vogel toward the zeppelin. This is also the last film in the franchise with Roach, who died in 2004."", u'Kevork Malikyan (Kazim) lost the role of Sallah in Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) to John Rhys-Davies, but was remembered by Steven Spielberg for this movie.', u'Harrison Ford and Sir Sean Connery passed up three subsequent opportunities to work together. Connery accepted a role in The Hunt for Red October (1990), while Ford declined the role of Jack Ryan, which went to Alec Baldwin instead. Ford later took over the role in Patriot Games (1992). Ford and Connery both declined the roles of Alan Grant and John Hammond, respectively, in Jurassic Park (1993).

Resetting between takes took twenty minutes, while the hydraulics were put to their starting positions, and the cracks filled with plaster. The shot of the Grail falling to the temple floor, causing the first crack to appear, was attempted on the full-size set, but proved to be too difficult. Instead, crews built a separate floor section that incorporated a pre-scored crack, sealed with plaster. It took several takes to throw the Grail from six feet onto the right part of the crack.', u""The tank broke down twice.

This was the certificate for which Steven Spielberg himself was partly responsible.', u'The shot of the boats passing between two ships was achieved by first cabling the ships off so they would be safe. The ships were moved together while the boats passed between, close enough that one of the boats scraped the sides of the ships. An empty speedboat containing dummies was launched from a floating platform between the ships amid fire and smoke that helped obscure the platform. The stunt was performed twice, because the boat landed too short of the camera in the first attempt.', u'Originally, Elsa was going to be the one that shoots Henry Jones, Sr. and drink from the wrong Grail.', u'The tank only moved at ten to twelve miles per hour, which Vic Armstrong said made it difficult to film Indiana riding a horse against the tank, while making it appear faster.', u""Stop motion animation was used for the shot of the German fighter's wings breaking off as it crashes through the tunnel. The tunnel was a two hundred ten foot model, that occupied fourteen of ILM's parking spaces for two months. It was built in eight-foot sections, with hinges allowing each section to be opened, through which to film. Harrison Ford and Sir Sean Connery were filmed against bluescreen.

Henry and Elsa (who is described as having dark hair) were searching for the Grail on behalf of the Chandler Foundation, before Henry went missing. The character of Kazim is here named Kemal, and is an Agent of the Republic of Hatay, which seeks the grail for its own. Kemal shoots Henry, and dies drinking from the wrong chalice. The Grail Knight battles Indiana on horseback, while Vogel is crushed by a boulder when stealing the Grail. In his second draft, Indiana's mother, named Margaret in this version, dismisses Indiana when he returns home with the Cross of Coronado, while his father is on a long distance call. Walter Chandler of the Chandler Foundation features, but is not the main villain. He plunges to his death in the tank. Elsa introduces Indiana and Brody to a large Venetian family that knows Henry. Leni Riefenstahl appears at the Nazi rally in Berlin. Vogel is beheaded by the traps guarding the Grail. Kemal tries to blow up the Grail Temple during a comic fight, in which gunpowder is repeatedly lit and extinguished. Elsa shoots Henry, then dies drinking from the wrong Grail, and Indiana rescues his father from falling into the chasm, while grasping for the Grail."", u'Steven Spielberg originally had planned the tank chase to be a short sequence shot over two days, but he drew up storyboards to make the scene an action-packed centerpiece. Thinking he would not surpass the truck chase from Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) (because the truck was much faster than the tank), he felt this sequence should be more story-based, and needed to show Indiana and Henry helping each other. He later said he had more fun storyboarding the sequence than filming it.', u'After fleeing Castle Brunwald, and eluding the Nazi soldiers on motorcycles, Indiana and his father come to a fork in the road with a sign indicating left (North) to Berlin and right (South) to Venice.

""You can\'t just stop a train,"" he said, ""If it misses its mark, it takes blocks and blocks to stop it and back up."" Lantieri hid handles for the actors and stuntmen, on which to grab, when leaping from carriage to carriage. The carriage interiors, shot at Universal Studios Hollywood, were built on tubes that inflated and deflated to create a rocking motion.', u""It's no coincidence that Sir Sean Connery was cast as Indiana's father. One reason is, because the Indiana Jones franchise borrows a lot from old adventure movies, much like a son will gain traits from his father. The trait passed down from Connery, is that of James Bond, in that James Bond is always finding ridiculous ways to escape life threatening situations, this is seen in many Indiana Jones movies, like in the tank scene in this movie, or the bobsled scene in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984)."", u'Three cast members have played King Richard I, a.k.a. the Lionheart. Julian Glover played the part in Doctor Who (1963), John Rhys-Davies in Robin Hood (1984), and Sir Sean Connery in Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves (1991).', u""Before this film, Sir Sean Connery appeared in Marnie (1964), as the love interest for Tippi Hedren. Just the previous year, Harrison Ford appeared in Working Girl (1988) as the love interest for Hedren's daughter, Melanie Griffith."", u'Scenes cut from the film: According to Jeffrey Boam\'s script, Indiana was taken to Donovan\'s apartment against his will. When encounters Walter Donovan\'s henchmen, they pull a gun on him, and Indiana agrees to follow them to avoid endangering students with a fight on campus. Somemore footage of Indiana\'s coerced trip to Donovan\'s penthouse apartment is also shown. In the finished film, the scene was cut considerably, and an artful cut between the men approaching Indiana, and Indiana standing in Donovan\'s apartment, leads the story.Originally, the film was to show more of Indiana and Marcus on their flight to Venice. While studying his father\'s diary, Indiana finds a charcoal rubbing of Donovan\'s Grail tablet, and sees the stained-glass window sketch above Roman numerals. This foreshadows the discovery of the secret passage in the Venice library, and sets up Indiana\'s interest in making a rubbing of the knight\'s shield. What remains of this footage, was incorporated into the montage, as the familiar red line traces Indiana\'s route across the globe.When Indiana and Elsa arrived at the Brunwald castle to free Henry from the Nazis, Indiana presents himself as a Scottish Lord, by imitating a Scottish accent. The suspicious butler who opens the door, acknowledges Indiana\'s skim, and answers by saying, ""If you are a Scottish lord, then I am Jesse Owens."" The reference to the black Olympic runner who defeated Nazi Germany at the Olympic games of 1936, was appropriate for the time and place, but might have gone over the heads of many viewers. George Lucas and Steven Spielberg changed the reference to Mae West, but decided again that modern movie audiences would miss the joke. So, they settled on Mickey Mouse, something everyone young and old can relate to, even though it wouldn\'t be the first thing to come to the mind of an elderly German butler from the 1930s. With his bluff called, Indiana knocks the old butler unconscious, takes him on his back, and starts looking for a place to hide the body, while Elsa congratulates him for his accent. Finally, they hide the butler in a sarcophagus, that once its lid is closed, features a face similar to the butler\'s face. In the finished film, we see Indiana knocking out the butler, and from there we witness Indiana and Elsa wandering in the castle, with no interest in the butler\'s body.As Marcus and Sallah tried to run from the Nazis at the Iskenderun train station, there was originally two additional actions, one of Sallah slapping a camel, and causing it to spit mucus all over the Nazis nearby, and another of Sallah fighting the Nazis.Originally, the sequence in which Indiana recovers the Grail diary, and gets it signed by Hitler, was longer. Before the book burning rally started, Hitler was seen marching with his Lieutenants, while a woman was filming the scene. Although her name was not mentioned, the woman was assumed to be Leni Riefenstahl, Hitler\'s official biographer. Indiana is stopped by a Nazi wearing a long black overcoat, who reprimands him for intruding on the procession. Much like the scene in ""Raiders"", Indiana knocks the bossy superior officer out cold, and steals his clothing. This brief comedic scene explains where Indiana got the disguise he wears at the Berlin airport in the following scene. Possibly it was cut, to avoid repeating the same joke too many times.As Indiana and Henry prepare to buy a ticket, Indiana spots Vogel and other Nazis standing guard at the plane ticket lines. He rushes Henry back through the crowd to hide him, then goes to the only unguarded ticket line. This explains why they ended up using as unorthodox means of travel as a zeppelin. It seems like the scene where Indiana tells his dad he ""got the first available flight out of Germany"" was filmed as an efficient substitute for this longer cat-and-mouse sequence.Originally, there was a German World War I flying ace trying to impress fellow zeppelin passengers with his spectacular war stories. This scene would have probably cut back and forth between the flying ace and the conversation between Indiana and his Dad over on the other side of the passenger lounge. After Indiana and his Dad head down below to the biplane, everyone in the passenger lounge is alerted to the presence of ""spies"" on-board. The drunken flying ace jumps up to help in catching these spies, and with several others, he heads down below to find that Indiana and his Dad have already left in the biplane. Fortunately, for Indiana\'s pursuers, there is another plane attached to the bottom of the zeppelin. Without thinking, the flying ace hurriedly jumps into the plane\'s cockpit, along with a young pilot that tagged along. In his drunken state, the flying ace forgets to start the plane\'s engine before detaching it from the zeppelin, therefore causing the plane to plummet to the ground. This scene also features the appearance of Indiana Jones veteran Pat Roach, as the black dressed Gestapo Agent who follows the Flying Ace to death.A brief scene, showing Indiana and Henry getting off the train at Iskenderun to meeting Sallah. It would have answered the question of how they got to Iskenderun and meet with Sallah.Kevork Malikyan spent hours with Steven Spielberg staging his death scene. He was to collapse into Alison Doody\'s arms and slide down her body. After grabbing him, she pulls her hands back to find them covered with blood. The shot never managed to achieve the impact Spielberg wanted, and he finally dropped it. The scene was actually a re-creation of David Gelin\'s death from The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956).After surviving the tank battle, Indiana and company witness an explosion in the distance. The Nazis are blasting a wider entrance through the canyon. This scene was part of a larger cut story element, about the Grail Temple being hidden past a narrow chasm. This also explained how it could go undiscovered for so long. Since Henry has a copy of the map to the canyon in his diary, this transitional scene was considered unnecessary.The second challenge in the Grail Temple was first planned to have tarantulas hidden under each wrong letter. Indiana is shown being menaced by a tarantula crawling up his body, after stepping on the ""J"". While in post-production, Spielberg decided the scene didn\'t have the impact, for which he was looking, and he came up with the chasm under the stone tablets.', u'Last theatrical film of Paul Maxwell.', u'This was the last film for veteran cinematographer Douglas Slocombe.

Billy J. Mitchell and Jerry Harte, despite being credited in the end titles, were cut out of the final print.', u""A smaller section of the tank's top, made from aluminum, and which used rubber tracks, was used for close-ups. It was built from a searchlight trailer, weighed eight tons, and was towed by a four-wheel drive truck. It had safety nets on each end to prevent injury to those falling off."", u'During the chase scene, when you see Henry and Indiana riding on the motorcycle in Germany, after Indiana rescues Henry, you see dust flying in their faces, even though there is not supposed to be anybody in front of them. This is because the vehicle carrying the camera is in front of them, therefore kicking up the dust that you see. During other shots, when you see the side of them, there is no dust, and nobody in front of them.', u""Three of the lead actors in this film have shared a film role with their own real-life sons.

At the climax, a Nazi villain touches the Grail and explodes. When Henry touches it, he ascends a stairway to Heaven. Chantal chooses to stay on Earth, because of her love for Indiana. In a revised draft dated two months later, Indiana finds his father in Krak des Chevaliers, the Nazi leader is a woman named Greta von Grimm, and Indiana battles a demon at the Grail site, which he defeats with a dagger inscribed with ""God is King"".

He visited a museum to negotiate renting a small French World War I tank, but decided he wanted to make one. The tank was based on the tank Mark VIII, which was thirty-six feet (eleven meters) long, and weighed twenty-five tons. Gibbs built the tank over the framework of a twenty-five ton excavator, and added 6.4 ton tracks, that were driven by two automatic hydraulic pumps, each connected to a Range Rover V8 engine. Gibbs built the tank from steel, rather than aluminum or fiberglass, because it would allow the realistically suspensionless vehicle to endure the rocky surfaces. Unlike its historical counterpart, which had only the two side guns, the tank had a turret gun added as well. It took four months to build, and was transported to Almer\xeda on a Short Belfast plane, and then a low loader truck.', u'The motorcycles used in the chase from the castle were a mixed bag.

For this movie, ILM scanned several filmed make-up transformations of ""Donovan\'s demise"" and ""morphed"" the elements together digitally.

The shot was very complicated and would require a single take. He gave instructions to Christian Bale to get excited, jump up and down, and run around on the rooftop as the planes passed and the bombs went off. However, Bale became nervous as the stunts began, and didn't do much of anything. Since most of the explosions had been used up on this shot, Spielberg (after having some soft, fatherly words with the young Bale) improvised with several shots from different close-up angles, eventually getting Bale to give a more excited performance."", u'Eric Flynn, who plays a British POW, was actually a POW as a child in a Japanese camp.', u'Christian Bale was picked for the role of Jim out of more than 4,000 who auditioned. Steven Spielberg had seen Bale in the miniseries Anastasia: The Mystery of Anna (1986) and Amy Irving, who starred in it, personally recommended Bale to Spielberg, her husband at the time. Spielberg had not thought much of Bale in ""Anastasia"", but cast him in the role of Jim after he auditioned.', u'""Suo G\xe2n"", the movie\'s theme song, is a lullaby sung in Welsh.

It was sung by James Rainbird.', u""The movie's Japanese Zero fighters are in fact American-built Harvard trainers modified to look like the Zero."", u'The portion of the film set in the internment camp was significantly cut down from what was filmed. Many actors had their roles nearly turned into cameos, including Miranda Richardson.', u'The B-29 bomber which passes by in a short scene was a gigantic radio-controlled model. It had operating undercarriage, bomb doors and flaps, and a wing span of 18 feet. Six radio receivers in the plane and two transmitters were used to control the plane.', u'Col. Marshall (Tom Danaher) was a Marine night fighter pilot in the Pacific in WWII and was credited with shooting down the last Japanese bomber of the war. He also flies one of the Japanese ""Zeros"" in the movie.', u'Christian Bale used to breathe heavily and do run ups, and jump up and down for five minutes before every take to get fit and prepare for the scene.', u'Jims flying model plane was in reality radio controlled, so it could make all the movements the script called for.', u""Christian Bale's film debut."", u'In Rescue Dawn (2006), 19 years after this film, Christian Bale recounts an incident during World War II in which an American fighter plane on a strafing run flew closely past him with the canopy open and the pilots looking straight at him with his goggles up.', u'The shot of Jim\'s parents tucking him in bed is directly lifted from the Norman Rockwell painting ""Freedom from Fear"". Jim\'s father even holds a newspaper like the father in the painting. The main difference is that in the painting there are two children in bed. The painting is also featured when Jim is at a camp - in one moment he rearranges the pin-ups on his wall, Rockwell\'s painting is one of them.', u'David Lean originally wanted to direct.', u'Some of the ""Mustangs"" and ""Zeros"" in the background during the attack of the airfield were radio controlled models with a wingspan of 12 feet.

The ""Zero"" exploding in mid-air is, of course, also a model.

The song tells of a mother\'s love for her child, telling him that she will keep him warm and safe, that there is nothing to threaten him. But the movie\'s story revolves around Jim being separated from his mother and father at a young age, and having to survive numerous deadly dangers by his wits alone, apart from his parents.

She continued whipping him for Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977), and making all of that money.

Steven Spielberg also admitted that although he agreed with Lucas\' idea for a darker-toned film, he felt uncomfortable with certain scenes while filming them, and would attempt to inject some humorous elements into those scenes trying to lighten them up. The scene where Indy is fighting the Thuggee chief guard with a hammer, and the guard takes the hammer away and tosses it aside, only to have it land on a bystander\'s head, knocking him out with a comical thud, is a prime example of this scene ""lightening up"".', u""Amrish Puri shaved his head for the role of Mola Ram, creating such an impression, that he kept it shaved, and became one of India's most popular film villains."", u'Kate Capshaw\'s dress in the Shanghai club was completely made of 1920\'s and 1930\'s original beads.

Unfortunately, an elephant had started to eat the entire back of the dress, which was saved just in time.

The Indian government requested a copy of the script, and demanded that the word ""Maharajah"" be removed, fearing that the content did not reflect their culture. As a result, production was moved to Sri Lanka, where some locations were also used for The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957).', u'Steven Spielberg said in 1989, ""I wasn\'t happy with Temple of Doom at all.

He later added during the Making of Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom documentary, ""Temple of Doom is my least favorite of the trilogy. I look back and I say, \'Well the greatest thing that I got out of that was I met Kate Capshaw. We married years later, and that to me was the reason I was fated to make Temple of Doom.""', u'During production, the movie was starting to go over-budget, and Spielberg went to Writers Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz, and asked them to make changes to the script in order to save money. They removed one page from the script, and saved a million dollars. It was a planned air chase scene using vintage biplanes. The scene was removed from the movie, and was later incorporated into Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989).', u'All of the scenes involving the long rope bridge were filmed on three different continents. The entire bridge itself was built on-location in Sri Lanka, and the scenes where Indiana cuts the bridge were filmed there also.

Finally, the alligators at the end, were shot by Frank Marshall in Florida.', u""In the U.S., this film and Gremlins (1984) led to the creation of the PG-13 rating.

Some believed that both films would have been rated R if Steven Spielberg's name hadn't been attached (which is nonsense).

When it came time for the film crew to shoot on a suspension bridge over a gorge, the British engineers were able to design and build one for them very quickly.', u'The film\'s original title was ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Death"", which was changed, because it sounded too foreboding. It was retained as the film\'s German title (""Indiana Jones und der Tempel des Todes"").', u'When the two swordsmen attack Indiana on the cliff, and he attempts to reprise his response from the ""basket scene"" from Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) by reaching for his gun, a bit of music from the basket scene is heard.', u'Kate Capshaw was thrilled at the opportunity of singing and dancing in the opening musical number, but the reality was her dress was so tight, there was very little movement she could attempt without ripping it.', u'Lawrence Kasdan (Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)\'s Screenwriter) was asked to write the script. ""I didn\'t want to be associated with Temple of Doom"", he reflected. ""I just thought it was horrible. It\'s so mean. There\'s nothing pleasant about it. I think Temple of Doom represents a chaotic period in both their (Lucas and Spielberg) lives, and the movie is very ugly, and mean-spirited.""', u'George Lucas, Steven Spielberg, Gloria Katz and Willard Huyck were concerned how to keep the audience interested, while explaining the Thugee cult. Huyck and Katz proposed a tiger hunt, but Spielberg said, ""There\'s no way I\'m going to stay in India long enough to shoot a tiger hunt."" They eventually decided on a dinner scene involving eating bugs, monkey brains, and the like. ""Steve and George both still react like children, so their idea was to make it as gross as possible,"" says Katz.', u'The only Indiana Jones movie that does not show or make any references to the Ark of the Covenant. This is because the movie takes place one year before Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), so Indiana has yet to become interested in the Ark.', u""Part of the sound effect heard as the engines run out of fuel on the plane (at 0:16:54 and 0:16:57) is the same failing-engine sound effect used when Han Solo's Millennium Falcon fails to crank up in Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980)."", u'For the scene where Willie stirs up the soup, and several eyeballs rise to the surface, Steven Spielberg said that this particular scene was notoriously difficult to shoot, and it took many takes to get the result seen in the final film. The eyeballs were attached to the bottom of the soup bowl with stick-ups, and Kate Capshaw was supposed to give the soup a good stir in order to release the eyes, so they could rise to the surface, but the stick-ups held pretty tight, and for many takes, only one or two of the eyes would release and rise to the surface.', u'As he knew that he would spend a large portion of film shirtless, Harrison Ford underwent a strict weightlifting regimen to prepare for the film. In an interview on the DVD release, he credits being in such good shape for his quick recovery from a back injury while filming.', u'The huge mineshaft was a circular construction around the largest soundstage.

After he retrieves the Sankara stones from the Kali shrine, he looks up at a statue of a cobra poised to strike (like the one he famously faced in the Well of Souls scene in ""Raiders"") and straightens his hat. In the campfire scene, Willie mistakes a snake for an elephant trunk. While she grabs it and tosses it aside in annoyance, Indy is visibly disturbed by the snake\'s presence. This reinforces Indy\'s fear of snakes quite clearly.', u'George Lucas made the film a prequel, as he did not want the Nazis to be the villains once more.', u""In Club Obi-Wan, the artifact Indiana Jones is told to hand over, is the remains of Nurhaci, emperor of China from 1616-1626.

Stone later starred in King Solomon\'s Mines (1985) and its sequel, Allan Quatermain and the Lost City of Gold (1986), two films that attempted to duplicate the success of the ""Indiana Jones"" franchise. Also, Markie Post of Night Court (1984) fame, was heavily considered for the role of Willie Scott.', u'The ""giant vampire bats"" that are shown in the movie, were actually fruit bats. Vampire bats are a lot smaller.', u'Over two hundred forty 70mm prints of the film were made, the largest number ever for a single release.', u'An early draft of the script for Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) had Indiana Jones traveling to Shanghai to recover a piece of the Staff of Ra.

Sound Designer Ben Burtt had Fosselius record a gag line as a prank on Steven Spielberg. During a screening, which Fosselius attended, Spielberg was surprised and bemused when, at the ending, Indiana Jones delivers the stone to the Shaman who then exclaimed ""Wait a minute! You brought back the wrong stone!"" Spielberg leapt to his feet and demanded an explanation, which made Fosselius very fearful, until it was explained to be a joke. Spielberg began to laugh and the incident ended happily.', u'The village shaman refers to the Sankara stone as ""Shiva linga"". In traditional Hinduism, the linga is a tall, cylindrical stone representative of a phallus, often set inside a circle representing the yoni, or female organ. Together, the two symbols stand for the dualistic sexual energy of the god Shiva.', u'Around six thousand actors auditioned worldwide for the part of Short Round.

Interestingly, the idea of a family barricading itself in a farmhouse against hostile aliens bears a striking resemblance to Signs (2002), whose producers Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall are frequent Spielberg collaborators (Kennedy also co-produced E.T.).', u'In mid 2009, the home featured in the film, located in the Tujunga Canyon was saved from immolation in the treacherous Station Fire.

Spielberg was so pleased with their song ""Someone in the Dark"" that he asked them to make the entire album, which, in spite of the size of the task, they agreed to do. This boxed set included an LP, a book to read along with it and a poster of E.T. and Jackson. Epic Records allowed Jackson to record the album for MCA Records on the conditions that it not be released until after Christmas of 1982 so as to not compete with \'Thriller\' and that ""Someone in the Dark"" not be released as a single. Both of the conditions were breached by MCA Records; they released the storybook in November 1982 and gave promo copies of ""Someone In the Dark"" to radio stations. MCA Records were forced to withdraw the album and were prohibited from releasing ""Someone In the Dark"" as a single after court action was taken by Epic against them in a $2 million lawsuit, which MCA settled by paying Epic chief Walter Yetnikoff $500,000. Jones claims neither he nor Jackson received a dime for making the record, in spite of the large cash settlement involved and its considerable success: The audio book earned Jackson a Grammy Award in 1984 for Best Recording for Children. Upon collecting the award, and taking home a record eight Grammys from an unprecedented twelve nominations, the singer stated that of all the awards had gotten that night, he was ""most proud of this one"".', u'The late Michael Jackson owned one of the E.T. puppets.', u'The UFO shown on the television when Elliott has left E.T. home to attend school is from the movie This Island Earth (1955).

After Ray wrote the script, he sought the help of science fiction author Arthur C. Clarke in having the script produce in the United States. Clarke introduced Ray to his friend Mike Wilson, who helped promote the film to Columbia Pictures. Columbia signed on to the project and sought to cast Marlon Brando and Peter Sellers in the lead roles. However, a series of events led to the project being canceled. First, when Ray went to copyright his script, he was surprised to find that the script had already been copyrighted by Wilson as a co-written work, the authors being officially credited as ""Mike Wilson and Satyajit Ray,"" in that order. According to Ray, Wilson\'s only contribution to the script was his suggestion of the word ""broad"" instead of ""chick"" at one place in the script. Later, Brando dropped out of the project and, although an attempt was made to bring James Coburn in his place, Ray said he was disillusioned with Hollywood machinations and returned to Calcutta. The project was abandoned at that time and, although Columbia was interested in reviving the project in the 1970s and 1980s, nothing came of it. When ""E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial"" was released in 1982, many, including Arthur C. Clarke, saw striking similarities in the film to Ray\'s earlier script. Ray said that Steven Spielberg\'s movie ""would not have been possible without my script of \'The Alien\' being available throughout America in mimeographed copies.""

It eventually becomes a running joke through the series.

Contrary to popular belief, he did not swallow it. Freeman explained in an interview years later that the fly flew off at about the instant he uttered the word ""bad,"" but Steven Spielberg noticed it and decided it would be funny to cut out a few frames so the fly would not be seen flying away.

Paramount Executive Michael Eisner said that he felt the script for this film was the best he had ever read."", u'The monkey raising his paw and saying (in his own language) ""Heil Hitler"" was thought up by George Lucas, and is one of Steven Spielberg\'s two favorite scenes (in the video box set, he says his other favorite is the ""where doesn\'t it hurt"" love scene on the ship). In Empire magazine, Frank Marshall said that they got the monkey to do the Nazi salute by putting a grape on a fishing pole, and getting the monkey to reach for the grape, which was dangling just out of camera range. This took about fifty takes before it actually looked like a Nazi salute. Voice-artist Frank Welker provided the chattering sounds for the monkey, including the ""Sieg Heil""-like chirp that the monkey gives when it raises its paw in salute.

In fact, it was a stunt that Stuntman Terry Leonard had tried to pull off the year before, and failed to do so, in The Legend of the Lone Ranger (1981). He was thrilled at the chance of having another shot at it, but only agreed to do it, if his friend and colleague Glenn Randall, Jr. was driving. The truck was specially constructed to be higher above the ground than normal, so as to allow clearance for Indiana Jones to pass underneath safely. The center of the road was also dug out to allow more clearance. In Great Movie Stunts: Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), we see, on the camera slate, that the camera was set at twenty frames per second instead of the traditional twenty-four frames per second. In other words, the shots were done in ""fast motion"", so the truck was not really moving as fast as depicted on-screen. Harrison Ford was actually dragged behind the truck for some of the shots, badly bruising his ribs. When asked if he was worried, Ford quipped: ""No. If it really was dangerous, they would have filmed more of the movie first."" During the chase, Harrison Ford dispatches all three of his stunt doubles, all of which are playing German soldiers. Terry Leonard plays the driver of the truck, who gets punched out of the cab by Harrison. Vic Armstrong and Martin Grace play soldiers hanging onto the side of the truck, before being knocked off.

His first scene on his first day of filming involved being covered with tarantulas."", u'The opening scene in the lost South American temple, was partly based on a classic Disney Ducks adventure, written by legendary artist Carl Barks, many of whose comic books have inspired George Lucas and Steven Spielberg. Exploring a lost temple, Donald Duck, his nephews, and Scrooge McDuck must evade a succession of booby traps, like flying darts, a decapitating blade, a huge boulder, a tunnel flooded with a torrent of gushing water, et cetera, in the story ""The Prize of Pizarro"" (""Uncle $crooge"" no. 26, June-August 1959), which hit the newsstands when Lucas and Spielberg, both avowed fans of that comic book, were respectively fifteen and twelve-years-old.

His name was changed to Jones on the first day of production.', u'In filming the Well of Souls sequence, the producers scoured every pet shop in London, and the South of England, for every snake they could lay their hands on. Hence, there are snakes that are identifiable from many different geographical areas. However, once all the snakes were on-set, it became clear that there were not nearly enough of them, so Steven Spielberg had several hoses cut into lengths, and these were used as well. Looking closely, you can tell which are the real snakes and which are not. Some of the weeds in the scene, were lifted by Lawrence Kasdan from the Dagobah set of Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980).

""As much as I\'d like to do a movie with Spielberg, the script is as moronically shitty, as so many other flicks of this ilk."" Kinski chose to appear in Venom (1981), because the salary was better. Michael Sheard also auditioned for the role. Ronald Lacey, who had given up acting to become an agent, was chosen because he reminded Steven Spielberg of Peter Lorre.

In the uncut conversation between Indy and Marion at the Raven Bar, Marion explains the cause of Abner\'s death, and tells Indy about the difficult last two years of her life. After having arranged the following day\'s appointment for the delivery of the medallion, Indy turns to leave, only to return under Marion\'s urge. She grabs his jacket and pulls him close for a kiss. The whole Raven Bar scene was cut because it was considered too long. The kissing part can be seen in The Making of Raiders of the Lost Ark documentary. The scene appears in a script draft, the novelization, and the Marvel Comics movie adaptation. A plot element involving the Ark of the Covenant was cut from the film, and is only hinted at during the finale, when the Ark is opened. Basically, there were two rules about the Ark not mentioned in the final cut of the film: 1. If you touch the Ark, you die. 2. If you look at the Ark when it is opened, you die. This is first explained in additional dialogue for the scene when Indy and Sallah visit the Imam. Before translating the writings on the headpiece that give the height of the Staff of Ra, Imam warns Indy not to touch the Ark, or look at it when it is opened. The next scene involving this Ark subplot, is when Sallah and Indy remove the Ark from the Well of the Souls. When Sallah first sees it he reaches out to touch it. Indy stops him before he does, and reminds him of the Imam\'s warning. Then they insert long poles through each side of the Ark to lift it out of its crypt. Notice that nobody ever touches the Ark throughout the rest of the film, until the finale. While Indiana Jones is in the map room trying to find the exact location of the Well of the Souls, two German soldiers approach Sallah and order him to help them remove their truck that had been stuck in the sand. In the process, Sallah loses the rope, with which he was supposed to help Indy get out of the map room. In a continuing scene, we see Sallah entering a German tent looking for something to substitute his missing rope, and awhile later he comes up with a ""rope"" made of bed sheets and a Nazi flag. What we don\'t see, is Sallah in a state of panic, wandering in the Nazi camp at breakfast time. A group of German soldiers ask him to serve them water from a marmite. Sallah spills the content of the marmite on the German officers\' uniforms and leaves promising to return with fresh water. The scene called for smoke in the background, but unfortunately the tires, used to produce the smoke were too many, thus making the scene too dark. Steven Spielberg opted to cut this scene, instead of spending half a day shooting it again. With Indy and Marion left to suffocate in the Well of the Souls, the Germans decide that Sallah should be executed. A young German soldier was supposed to carry out the dirty job, but things changed when he started having second thoughts. A German youth vacationing in Tunisia had been hired for the part of the young soldier. The funny thing is that this inexperienced young man managed to express brilliantly the moral dilemma of a young soldier forced to decide whether or not to kill a harmless stranger. This is the business of foreign wars, and this unknown German boy was able to convey it as well as any actor. The result was beyond description, with this German student playing an intensely moving and emotional scene, making David Wisnievitz and Karen Allen call it the greatest moment since the film began. Spielberg said the bitter truth was that brilliant and memorable though the scene was, it would probably end up on the cutting room floor, because it was just too long. So it did. There was a small cut during the scene where Indy and Marion escape from the Well of Souls. When Indy pushes the large stone brick out of the room filled with mummies, there is an Arab guard standing outside. When the Arab and Indy come face to face, Indy simply knocks him unconscious. Evidence of this scene still remains in the film. As Indy steps out of the chamber, he pauses and looks off to the left side of the screen. In the following shot, when Indy and Marion run from the building to the German plane, the Arab is visible lying on the ground by the building. Indy surviving the submarine journey by lashing himself to the periscope with his whip. In the final film, the plot hole goes largely unnoticed. Most people seem to assume either that Indy snuck inside the sub, or that it stayed on the ocean surface for the duration of the trip. This cut scene did appear in the Marvel Comics adaptation.', u'Steven Spielberg admitted in the ""Making of"" DVD that watching the stage hands preparing the Well of Souls set by laying out the thousands of snakes for the scene really made him nauseous, even to the point where he nearly wanted to puke a few times.', u""With four illustrators, this was Steven Spielberg's most storyboarded film of his career to date."", u'Steven Spielberg asked Producer Frank Marshall to find a mountain that looked like the Paramount logo.

The producers contacted the owner of the craft about using the flying boat for the movie, and though he responded that he was happy to help out, he informed them that only one of the flying boat\'s engines had been restored to working order, therefore, for the shot used in the movie, we see only that single engine running. Additionally, in order to convey the fact that it was a passenger aircraft, Spielberg had several production assistants dressed in period clothing, and filmed them simply walking through the doorway of the plane.', u'Instead of the standard Paramount logo used between 1975-87, the opening logo was a version of the studio logo used in the 1940s or 1950s which read: ""A Paramount Picture"".

However, since the map used for the film is geographically inaccurate, as it does not include several of the other islands found in this location, it is believed that the island location used was fictitious, and that it does not actually exist. However, due to its small and uninhabitable size and shape, as shown in wide and overhead shots in the film (a better overhead image of the islands shape is shown as the lid of the Ark flies into the heavens), this would indicate that the island is possibly, or if not modeled after, the small Greek rock island of ""Pachia"".', u'George Lucas came up with Marion punching Indiana in Nepal.', u'The Flying Wing in the fighting scene in Egypt is not a real plane.

In order to get her into the dress, Karen Allen and Paul Freeman improvised the scene where she hides a knife with the older clothes she takes off to try to seduce Belloq and escape, and thus giving her character a plausible reason to be in the dress. Allen thought it would also be a good idea to callback to the drinking game scene that introduces her character in the beginning of the movie."", u'An episode of The Big Bang Theory (2007) includes mention of a theory stated by the character Amy that Indiana Jones supposedly had no effect on the outcome since the Nazis actually did get the ark.

Pacino wasn\'t interested, and Nicholson thought that any actor would be overwhelmed by the special effects. Hackman turned down the role because he was in a troubled marriage and could not spend 16 weeks outside of Los Angeles on location-shooting.

Still, the experience gave him good insight into what it takes to act in film.

Spielberg and his crewmates later realized that Truffaut was used to directing movies in small, intimate settings, and Truffaut simply could not grasp the scale of the landing site. When he went into the set of the hotel room where Jillian watches the Devils Tower newscast, Truffaut stood in the middle of the room, raised his arms up, and said, ""Now, THIS is a set!""', u'One early concept for interpreting the aliens included an orangutan on roller skates. The idea did not work, because the orangutan became very frightened the second its roller skates touched the ground, and it kept grabbing onto the arms of its caretaker.', u""All of the stars in the background of the night shots, as well as many distant trees, hills, roads, etc. were special effects and not real. This is true even in non-special effect shots, such as when Neary's truck is just driving along country roads."", u'Melinda Dillon - who earned an Oscar nomination for her performance - was not cast until the weekend before she was due to begin filming.', u'A model miniature was used for some of the shots in the climactic scene. At least part of the illumination coming out of the ship was created by a set of Christmas lights strung up on the back of a metal plate, behind little tiny alien figures, creating the silhouetted look we see. This was composited into a shot with real-life actors.', u'The federal agent-types on stage with Lacombe during the auditorium scene in which he teaches the hand signals were real federal agents. Similarly, some of the extras who played scientists in the end sequence were real scientists. However, one of the ""agents"" was actually the principal of Foley High School in Foley AL, a town near Mobile AL, and was an actor in local theaters.', u'The production began shooting on December 29, 1975, at an air traffic control centre in Palmdale, California, so that Columbia, juggling its very shaky resources, could qualify for a tax shelter. That shoot wrapped after two days and filming would not resume again until the following May.', u""Steven Spielberg repeatedly watched John Ford's The Searchers (1956) while he was making the film."", u'Vilmos Zsigmond, the director of photography on The Sugarland Express (1974), returned to work with Spielberg after passing up the job of shooting Jaws (1975). He found the director more commanding and less eager to discuss options than previously, but Zsigmond was enthusiastic to be on the picture. ""[Close Encounters] had the smell of a great movie. We fell into sandtraps not because anybody made mistakes but because we were making things that had never been done before."" Zsigmond found himself blamed for many of those ""sandtraps"" by producer Julia Phillips and the studio, who almost fired him over his insistence that he needed at least one day to pre-light the enormous set. Nevertheless, Zsigmond refused to give in to pressure to use less lighting, and he was supported in this by Spielberg and especially Trumbull, who knew what it would take to match the scenes to the special effects. After the first two months of shooting in Mobile, when studio executives and financial backers began to show up on set, Phillips insisted on firing him. Several other cinematographers were called as potential replacements--John A. Alonzo, L\xe1szl\xf3 Kov\xe1cs, Ernest Laszlo--but most of them were friends of Zsigmond and agreed that if he couldn\'t handle the job, no one could.', u'In an interview for the ""making-of"" featurette on the DVD release, a grown Cary Guffey said it was embarrassing for him to shoot the scene of him exiting the mother ship because he had to wear ballet slippers to keep from falling on the ramp.', u'The UFO landing site built for the movie was 27 m high, 137 m long, and 76 m wide, making it the largest indoor film set ever constructed. The structure included 6.4 km of scaffolding, 1570 square metres of fibreglass, and 2740 square metres of nylon canopy.', u'The film originally ended with the version of ""When You Wish Upon a Star"" used in the film Pinocchio (1940), but it tested negatively in previews and was cut. That is why Roy Neary was trying to convince his family to see that film together just before the blackout. The song remains incorporated in the John Williams score, though. A toy can also be heard playing the song\'s melody right before Roy rips off the top off his sculpture.', u'The actors had to spend a lot of time acting to objects and things that weren\'t there and being told by Steven Spielberg what they were looking at and how to react. ""For weeks we were just sitting on a rock, shifting positions, pretending to look at the landing site and the sky,"" Melinda Dillon said. ""It was a great acting exercise."" Fran\xe7ois Truffaut, however, found it very difficult, finally giving himself over to be nothing more than another object in the ""grand cartoon strip"" of 2,000 storyboard sketches Spielberg had shown him. When Richard Dreyfuss saw the final picture, he was upset with several moments of his performance, believing he would have reacted quite differently if he had seen the actual effects.', u""Richard Dreyfuss's father was an extra in the film and spent six months on location; however, the scenes in which he appeared never made the final cut."", u'From a budget of $20 million (sizeable at the time), this went on to become one of the top grossing films of the 1970s.', u'A highly detailed miniature and the filming technique ""forced perspective"" were used to create the effect of an ocean freighter left stranded in the Gobi desert.', u'The film holds the record for most cinematographers on a production (11, counting the Special Edition).', u'Famed ufologist J. Allen Hynek - who coined the phrase ""close encounter of the third kind"" - actually has a cameo in this movie. He can be seen as the gray-haired man with glasses, a pointed beard, and a pipe walking out to see the returnees in the final sequence.', u'Steven Spielberg was intimidated by the prospect of asking one of his cinematic heroes, Fran\xe7ois Truffaut, to play the part of Lacombe. Truffaut liked Spielberg\'s work and agreed but told him, ""I am not an actor; I can only play myself."" Spielberg replied that was exactly what he wanted, and Truffaut signed on for $75,000.', u'The character of Claude Lacombe (Fran\xe7ois Truffaut) is based on real-life French UFO expert Jacques Vall\xe9e.', u'The darkening sky and the shape of the clouds forming in the scene before Jilian\'s son gets abducted by the aliens resembles that of the ""Angel of Death"" in The Ten Commandments (1956) that comes into the sky before the slaying of all the firstborn of Egypt begins. Also, Roy and his family are watching this movie on TV before he is called to work after the power failure.', u""The nine foot diameter model of the mothership that was used in the final sequences was kept locked up in Steven Spielberg's garage to help prevent pictures of it from appearing in the media before the release of the film."", u'Steven Spielberg cast Teri Garr in the film after seeing her work on a coffee commercial. He was impressed that she was able to convey a wide range of emotions in just a 30-second clip.', u""When the lights go out in the Neary house during the blackout, the miniature lakes on Roy's model train layout continue to glow in the dark. This was supposed to have been the payoff for an earlier conversation cut from the film in which Roy's son Toby accused his father of stealing his luminous paint, which Roy insisted was not true."", u'Steven Spielberg edited the film secretly, not at the studio but in a rented apartment in Marina del Rey under guard.', u""According to the book 'Reel Gags' by Bill Givens, Grateful Dead singer Jerry Garcia was an extra during the scenes in India, and he can be seen in a crowd shot."", u'Steven Spielberg and Joe Alves at first thought they would build the landing site in Monument Valley but realized that would present great difficulties in controlling climate and lighting conditions. They settled on an abandoned hangar near Mobile, Alabama where they thought they\'d have greater control over the enormous $700,000 set. Bigger than a football field and six times the size of the largest Hollywood sound stage, the hangar harbored its own climate, trapping humidity that sometimes caused clouds and precipitation during filming. Dozens of very large lights were needed, and the 200 extras involved necessitated careful choreography of movement. All of this meant frequent delays and rising costs. The scenes filmed on this set accounted for only about a fifth of the film\'s running time but took up easily half of the shooting schedule. Spielberg stated, ""That set became our shark on this picture.""', u'The entire landing strip complex behind Devils Tower was actually constructed and filmed in an abandoned aircraft hangar at the former Brookley AFB in Mobile, Alabama.', u""Gillian's phone number, seen when she tries to dial for help when the aliens come for Barry, is 311-555-2368. This number frequently appeared on phones in Bell Telephone print ads around the late 1960s. Area code 311 is not an Area Code in North America, and it never will be. 311 is used in recent times as a non-emergency number for municipal services."", u'From the beginning when he took the part of Lacombe, Fran\xe7ois Truffaut made it quite clear that he was working strictly as an actor, and he had no interest in helping out as an assistant director.', u""Steven Spielberg had approached Steve McQueen, Dustin Hoffman, and Gene Hackman for the role of Roy Neary. Jack Nicholson was also considered. McQueen turned the role down because he said he wasn't able to cry on film."", u""One of the reasons behind new cost increases was Steven Spielberg's decision to release the film in 70mm using a process that allowed for a wider magnetic sound track to let him create greater audio impact as well as visual."", u'Although Steven Spielberg continued to support Vilmos Zsigmond, creating what the cinematographer called ""a very rewarding"" experience, Zsigmond was not asked to shoot additional sequences and shots that were needed after the company left Alabama. He believed this was largely the work of Julia Phillips and the studio. Although Zsigmond shot about 90 percent of the picture, additional material (the India sequence, the discovery of the lost Air Force squadron, etc.) was shot by others, primarily William A. Fraker, as well as Douglas Slocombe, John A. Alonzo, and L\xe1szl\xf3 Kov\xe1cs, all of whom received on-screen credit as additional directors of photography, a vindictive move by Phillips, by her own admission.', u'Despite the title ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind,"" Barry and the other abductees were actually involved in a case of ""Close Encounters of the Fourth Kind,"" which denotes abduction by extraterrestrial beings. However, among other problems, the phrase ""Close Encounters of the Fourth Kind"" had not been invented yet, and was unnecessary for Steven Spielberg\'s use.', u'Several scenes were filmed around Mobile, AL, and many locals were cast. This is why several characters in the film have accents uncharacteristic of those from Indiana and Wyoming.', u'This is essentially an adult rethink of ""Firelight,"" a movie that Steven Spielberg made as an adolescent. He even gave Douglas Trumbull and Vilmos Zsigmond notes that he\'d made at that time, for their work on ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind.""', u'The underside of the mothership was inspired by the lights of the San Fernando Valley at night.', u'A digital system called the Electronic Motion Control System was employed to record and program camera movements so they could be duplicated in post-production when putting live-action photography together with the matching miniature effects.', u'Julia Phillips, who by this time had developed a serious cocaine problem and was divorced from producer Michael Philips, was forced off the picture by Columbia during post-production in 1977.', u""Melinda Dillon was suffering from a sprained ankle when location shooting began in May 1976 at Devil's Tower.

As written, Jillian was to have remained in her house, shut off from the outside world. During production, however, Steven Spielberg decided it was better to show that Jillian had travelled out west searching for her missing son, and so the set of a New Mexico-style motel room was hastily built to film the scene."", u""Two of the old AMT Star Trek (1966) model kits - the USS Enterprise and the Klingon Battle Cruiser (both painted silver) - can be seen hanging over Roy's model railroad layout, on which he fashions his clay model of Devil's Tower."", u""Cary Guffey's performance was so outstanding, that his name was mentioned as a possible nominee for Best Supporting Actor, during the nominations process for the Academy Awards, in 1977.

He would come to find Close Encounters to be ""twice as bad, and twice as expensive, as well.""', u'Douglas Trumbull and Steven Spielberg went through several conceptions of what the UFOs would look like. One abandoned idea was to have them resemble structures and logos familiar on Earth, such as those for McDonalds and Chevron, to suggest the aliens were using human symbols to make their crafts appear less threatening.', u'During a fierce summer storm, the side of the hangar blew off. Luckily no one was hurt, but the accident caused further delays while it was repaired. Richard Dreyfuss later said, ""Part of the shoot was a nightmare. It went from fun to frightening.""', u'Steven Spielberg first considered doing a documentary or a low-budget feature film about people who believed in UFOs.', u'Steven Spielberg and other producers wanted Walter Cronkite as newsreader for the broadcast that Neary ignores in the living room sculpture scene. However, CBS would not allow Cronkite to take the role, so producers settled on ABC\'s Howard K. Smith. Unfortunately, the news cutaway scene to Wyoming reporter was filmed before this decision; as a result, the reporter says ""order your steak well done, Walter."" In addition, during the interrogation of Neary by Lacombe, Neary shouts ""you think I investigate every Walter Cronkite story there is?""', u'Because the complicated and extensive visual effects were stretching the limits of what had been done before, Steven Spielberg also discovered a difficult new challenge in having to shoot scenes without an exact idea of how they would look when Douglas Trumbull completed them and added them to the film in post-production, months after principal photography was finished. On Jaws, the effects were difficult, but they were mechanical and physical, right there before him every day. The unknown of working around optical effects to be added later meant a more tense on-set atmosphere. Trumbull said, ""I\'ll never be able to thank him enough for having the confidence and the patience to see it through time and not panic. There was enormous pressure on the production all the time from the studio to keep moving on.""', u'During the scene in which the power goes out at a McDonald\'s restaurant, the song ""More Than a Feeling"" by Boston can be heard coming from a car radio. This song appeared on the band\'s self-titled debut album in 1976 which, coincidentally, featured a huge saucer-shaped spaceship on the cover.', u""To get the spaceships' attention prior to their arrival at Devils Tower, the five notes the scientists play are G, A, F, (octave lower) F, C.

He finally suggested Devil's Tower in Wyoming, which closely resembled prominent features of Monument Valley, where John Ford shot movies like The Searchers (1956). Devil's Tower was preferable because it was less familiar to movie audiences and a more solitary and abrupt intrusion on the landscape. These features made the sheer, jagged-edge rock rising nearly 1,300 feet from the surrounding terrain eerie and imposing."", u'John Williams wanted the music to ""convey a sense of awe and fascination"" as well as ""overwhelming happiness and excitement"" at the prospect of seeing aliens for the first time.', u'When principal photography began again on May 16, 1976, the budget had risen in stages to $11 million, and kept climbing as Steven Spielberg expanded his ideas.', u""In the beginning of the film in the Sonoran Desert, from inside one of the World War II airplanes, they pull out a calendar that looks vintage from 1945. Across the grid of the days of a full month on the calendar is plainly seen a light blue logo from the defunct Security National Bank (which did not exist in 1945, either). In the fall of 1972, Security National Bank issued a 1973 calendar that corresponded exactly, month by month, day by day, to the 1945 calendar for fun. Thus, this unique idea was a promotional give away to the bank's customers. The props crew probably could not locate an authentic 1945 calendar, so instead they utilized the fake vintage calendar, which was not hard to find in 1976."", u""Production designer Joe Alves chose an old farmhouse located outside Fairhope, Alabama, for the Guiler home, feeling it had a lonely quality suited to Jillian's character as a free spirit."", u'During the very beginning of the ""space show"" at the end of the film, the various dots (ships) doing their tricks in the sky form the ""Big Dipper."" This takes place just before Roy and Gillian laugh as they watch the objects in the sky.', u'When the project was first pitched to Columbia in 1973, Steven Spielberg said it would cost $2.7 million to make. Due to delays caused by script development problems, he went on to make Jaws (1975), a huge success that gave him more status and bargaining power with the studio. At that point, exhausted and frazzled from the difficult location work on the shark movie, Spielberg decided he wanted to make Close Encounters entirely in the studio, and the budget was set at $4.1 million. As time went on and production ideas and plans grew more elaborate, it became clear more money would be needed, a prospect not looked on favourably by the financially strapped studio. Douglas Trumbull was surprised by the original low budget because he had estimated early on that his effects alone would cost about $3 million. The final figure for effects was fairly close to that.', u'Special effects were a part of more than 200 different shots in the movie, and some of them contained as many as 18 separate visual elements, including dozens of matte paintings and animated sequences. With no knowledge of such techniques, Steven Spielberg depended heavily on Douglas Trumbull. ""If Trumbull hadn\'t accepted the job,"" Spielberg said in a 1978 article, ""I\'d still be on the Columbia back lot trying to get a cloud to materialize from thin air.""', u'Jean Renoir compared the film to Jules Verne and Georges M\xe9li\xe8s.', u""When the aliens visit Jillian's home, there's a shot of the screws in the floor vent unscrewing. This is shown in an extreme close-up. The unscrewing effect is very similar to what we see in the movie version of The War of the Worlds (1953), which would later be remade by Spielberg himself."", u'The huge success of the film made a popular icon of its signature logo, a black-and-white image of a highway receding towards a glowing horizon at night. In 1978, an enterprising group of students from the College of Architecture at Ball State University in Muncie, IN, manufactured and sold a small production run of black T-shirts emulating the logo and typeface of the original, but reading ""MUNCIE INDIANA: A Gross Encounter of the Worst Kind.""

Tragically he lived only another eight years after filming Close Encounters of the Third Kind.', u'While no part of the film was actually shot in Muncie, Indiana, a production team did visit for local details and props, such as the pull-down map of Muncie that Roy consults in his truck. They also visited the bookstore of Ball State University for university memorabilia, such as a fraternity ""BSU"" paddle visible on Roy\'s wall, and the red-and-white ""BallU"" (or U-Ball) T-shirt worn by Roy in the shaving-cream scene.', u'Melinda Dillon was cast largely at the suggestion of director Hal Ashby. He had heard that Steven Spielberg was having difficulty casting the part of Jillian, and Ashby had just completed his movie Bound for Glory (1976) with her in the cast - and liked her work.

To prevent anyone not directly involved with the production from sneaking onto the set, everyone working on the film was required to wear an ID badge, and on one occasion Spielberg himself was barred from entry when he showed up without his.', u'Six ""wrap parties"" were held before the film completed its production, since Steven Spielberg was continually revising his vision of the film.', u'The organization that Claude Lacombe (Fran\xe7ois Truffaut) leads is called the ""Mayflower Project.""

One involved shooting them at normal speed while they moved through a sea of mimes dressed as technicians. The mimes would make slow motion movements so that when the film was sped up, the mimes looked normal and the aliens would appear to run about with super-human quickness. Flailing their arms and long hands about, they would somewhat resemble bugs. Inventive as it was, the human movements did not look convincing, so the idea was abandoned. Another idea was to suspend the aliens on wires and have them fly, since the mothership was supposedly in a lower gravity field (this line remains in the final cut of the movie as the ship lands: ""watch for dizziness and low gravity""), and Neary was even supposed to float up as he walked into the ship at the end. This idea was eventually cut too, as this meant there would be a huge number of wires that could not be concealed by lighting, so wires were only used on the very thin insectoid alien.', u""Dr. J.

There was a constant effort to get every arc light available to the location to film the reflections of the UFOs.

One of the names is Ken Swenson, who in reality was one of the model-makers working on this film.', u""The spindly alien which appears briefly, spreading it's arms in a peaceful gesture, was an elaborate marionette made for the film by puppeteer Bob Baker, and referred to during the production as 'Daddy Long Legs.' Actually the prototype for a planned sequence involving several aliens performed as marionettes, Baker's alien had transparent skin so that the internal organs and skeleton were visible, including a beating heart. Although the idea of using marionettes was abandoned, a last minute decision was made to include Baker's prototype, and so a miniature set of the mothership ramp was constructed to film the creature emerging from the ship."", u""When the mothership opened, strings of white cubes were originally supposed to come out of it, quickly flying through the area like little sensors probing the surroundings.

Unfortunately, and rather prophetically, considering the later technical difficulties the production would suffer, the shark malfunctioned, and Lucas got stuck in the mouth of the shark.

Eventually, Quint would be discovered sitting by himself. Spielberg says that the only thing that stopped him from doing that scene was Gregory Peck, who held part of the rights to that movie.

The producers said that they were not making Moby Dick (1956) and they would not work with someone who did not know the difference between a whale and a shark.', u'Although director Steven Spielberg wanted Charlton Heston to play Brody, the main reason he decided against casting Heston was because of his ""saving the day"" role in his previous movies, Airport 1975 (1974) and Earthquake (1974).

These scenes were filmed by noted shark photographers Ron Taylor and Valerie Taylor with the help of shark expert Rodney Fox specifically for the movie. Because the Great White sharks they filmed would be smaller than the mechanical shark in the movie, they constructed a smaller version of Hooper's shark cage. Inside the cage they alternately used a small mannequin or a little person. One of the sharks they attracted got caught in the cage's cables and tore it apart trying to escape.

To accomplish this, there was a speedboat with a rope attached to it that ran under the Orca\'s hull and hooked to the other side. It would be gunned at full speed, causing the Orca to rock violently and everyone on board to fall, which is what they wanted.

There is a shot of the bloody, dying man\'s upper body being dragged briefly along in the shark\'s jaws before being pulled underwater.

Spielberg believed that the swell of the boats would help indicate the huge size of the shark; however, the logistics involved (for example, getting all the boats to go up and down at the correct intervals) proved too difficult to coordinate properly. Additionally, the constantly malfunctioning shark would not allow the scene to be filmed.

Marvin thanked him but replied that he would rather go fishing. Spielberg then wanted Sterling Hayden for the role of Quint. Hayden, however, was in trouble with the Internal Revenue Service for unpaid tax. All of Hayden's income from acting was subject to a levy by the IRS, so there was an attempt to circumvent that; Hayden was also a writer, so one idea was to pay him union scale for his acting and buy a story from him (his literary income was not subject to levy) for a large sum. It was concluded that the IRS would see through this scheme, so Robert Shaw was cast by Spielberg instead on the recommendation of the film's producers, Zanuck and Brown."", u'Director Steven Spielberg attributed many problems to his perfectionism and his inexperience. The former was epitomized by his insistence on shooting at sea with a life-sized shark.

As for his lack of experience, ""I was naive about the ocean, basically.

At one point, Shaw, remarking loudly on what he said was Dreyfuss\' cowardice, dared him to climb to the top of the Orca\'s mast (about 75 feet) and jump off into the ocean, for which he would pay him upwards of $1,000 (the price rising with each taunt). Steven Spielberg finally intervened by telling Dreyfuss, ""I don\'t care how much money he offers you, you\'re not jumping off the mast, not in my movie.""', u'Some scenes that have been declared ""missing"" from the video were not in the original theatrical release.

Fierro said she obliged them for some time, but eventually decided to stop doing it.', u'In the inquest scene where Hooper confirms the shark attacks as he analyzes the remains of the first victim Chrissie Watkins, he names two likely suspects by their scientific names but never clarifies them. Longimanus refers to the Oceanic Whitetip Shark (Carcharhinus Longimanus), well-known for following ships in the expectation of a sinking. Issurus Paucus is the rare Longfin Mako.

The first big response was for the shark\'s appearing when Brody is chumming. Director Steven Spielberg says that he ""got greedy"" and wanted a scream from the earlier sequence. He re-shot the scene in editor Verna Fields\' swimming pool, numerous ways, to finesse the moment. He then found that the chumming scene got less of a scream, which he eventually realized was because the audience didn\'t trust him, and was wary about what might come next.', u""With the schedule expanding from 52 to 155 days, director Steven Spielberg had to juggle Universal's impossible deadlines, an unfinished script, chaotic conditions off Martha's Vineyard, and a belligerent Robert Shaw.

So, while the last shot -- the blowing up of the shark -- was being filmed, Spielberg was on a plane back to Los Angeles."", u'When Roy Scheider was trapped in the sinking Orca, it took 75 takes to get the shot right. Scheider did not trust the special effects team to rescue him in case of an emergency so he hid axes and hatchets around the cabin just in case.', u""Though his affair with Brody's wife was left out of the film, Hooper's death was actually in the script. The plan was to have a dummy representing Hooper placed in a cage underwater, and Australian filmmakers Ron and Valerie Taylor, who were filming the underwater shark scenes in Australia, would entice an actual shark to attack the cage and tear the dummy apart. They could never provoke the shark properly. Ultimately, the shark did attack and destroy the cage, but there was one problem: the Hooper dummy wasn't inside at the time. As this was the best footage they had, Steven Spielberg decided to use it, and allow Hooper to escape the shark."", u'In the original script, Quint was killed off by drowning. The rope from the harpoon that he fires at the shark wraps around his foot and he is pulled under by the shark, calling for Brody to give him the knife. (This was also the way the character was killed off in the book and, according to an interview with Steven Spielberg about this scene, it is similar to the way Ahab dies in ""Moby Dick"".) However, it was decided that Quint should be eaten as this would be the most tragic for the character based on his experiences on the USS Indianapolis, so the script was changed to what is in the movie.', u'Quint\'s name comes from the Latin word for ""fifth"". Quint is the fifth person killed by the shark (after Chrissie Watkins, Alex Kintner, Ben Gardner\'s disembodied head in boat, and Michael\'s sailing teacher).', u'Before the shark was blown up at the end, an explosives expert with a blasting permit was needed. Richard S. Edwards had done extensive explosives work while in the Navy and then for Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, and he agreed to place the dynamite for the final scene. Finding he couldn\'t get past the teeth of the shark mock-up, he was forced to crawl into the back of the device, but it was made of sharp fiberglass. After wrapping his knees with towels and putting on heavy gloves, he had to carry the dynamite in his mouth to place it in the head of the ""shark,"" where his picture was taken and is now in the archives of Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, along with the oral history that describes his contribution to this classic movie.', u""Peter Benchley was not happy with Steven Spielberg's ending where the shark is killed when a compressed air tank explodes in its mouth, claiming it was unrealistic. Spielberg defended himself by saying he will have held his audiences' attention for two hours and they would believe anything in the end no matter how unrealistic or unbelievable the ending really was. Spielberg even thought of an ending where after the shark is blown up, Brody would look up to see several shark fins."", u""The entire second half of Jaws (1975) takes place on the ocean, with just Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss carrying it between the three of them. No other characters appear (bar the shark) and dry land is glimpsed near the end of the move. The reason was Spielberg didn't want land to be seen because he thought the audience would think that the characters could just run back to shore. He wanted to isolate the audience as much as the characters."", u""After the shark blows up, the groaning sound effects during the shot of the carcass sinking are the same ones the truck makes as it crashes off a cliff in Steven Spielberg's first film, Duel (1971). The sound effect is from the original Creature from the Black Lagoon (1954)."", u'In the original novel, Hooper has an affair with Brody\'s wife, and is killed by the shark in the cage at the end. However, because the relationship between Brody\'s wife and Hooper was considered by many to be irrelevant to the plot, and arbitrarily included in the novel just to ""sex it up"", it was omitted from the film script, and Hooper was allowed to survive.', u""The original scene of Alex Kintner's death called for a doll of Alex to be floating among the bathers, then the shark would jump out of the water and grab the doll and raft in its mouth. But as was typical of the mechanical shark, it didn't function properly. It would either come out of the water too high, not high enough or totally miss the raft. Finally, the shark succeeded in grabbing the raft, and in doing so, rolled over on its side, much like a real shark would do. This is the take Spielberg decided to use. However, the producers were concerned that the image of the shark with Alex in its mouth was too disturbing and might jeopardize the film's PG rating. Therefore, Spielberg and editor Verna Fields trimmed the beginning of the shot so only the shark's fins are briefly seen as it flips over."", u'The shark has 4 minutes of screen time.', u'Body Count: eight (five people, one dog, and two sharks)', u""The story that Quint tells about his experiences aboard a sinking cruiser is a fictionalized version of the actual World War II Portland-class cruiser USS Indianapolis. Of the 1,196 crewman aboard only 316 survived while 300 died during the sinking and the other 579 dying from exposure, dehydration, drinking salt water and some from shark attacks. The majority of the dialogue in the film was largely written by Robert Shaw. The most major difference between Quint's account and the actual event was the date of the sinking (mentioned in the film as June 29, 1945), while the ship was actually sunk over a month later on July 30."", u'According to Carl Gottlieb\'s ""The Jaws Log"", Steven Spielberg was never happy with the moment when Ben Gardner\'s head appears in the hole in the bottom of his boat. Preview audiences jumped at this scene, but Spielberg wanted more than an ordinary shock moment. However, the studio was unwilling to budget a re-shoot. So Spielberg declared that he\'d pay for it himself, assembling a crew in editor Verna Fields\' back-yard swimming pool, which would serve as the underwater location. A gallon of milk gave the water enough of the look of Nantucket Sound. The boat bottom was placed in the pool and Richard Dreyfuss\' stunt double went through the action. The studio eventually ate the cost of the re-shoot, and the scene was taken to a much higher level, just by changing the composition and timing of a few feet of footage.', u""When the shark is destroying the cage after Hooper swims away, you can see the shark turn and twist upside down. This was actual footage shot by Ron Taylor. As seen and explained in a recent Jaws (1975) documentary, the Great White Shark the couple had been filming became entangled in the cage's suspension ropes. The cage broke loose and sank to the bottom, however the shark managed to escape and swim off (as can also be seen in the film). After the shark had cleared the area, Ron had to take a second cage to the bottom in order to rescue the first. Ron and Valerie Taylor eventually went on to develop the chain-mail shark-proof diving suit."", u'In the book, it is revealed that Mayor Larry Vaughan is being blackmailed by the Mafia to keep the beaches open. The Mob has invested in Amity real estate, and is hoping for a multi-million dollar sale.', u'The sound-effect used when the shark first reveals itself, as Brody is throwing chum, is actually a fizzy-pop bottle being opened onto concrete after being shaken up. This sound effect was changed for the 25th DVD edition of the movie.', u""Regarding the ending, author Peter Benchley thought Steven Spielberg's idea of shooting and blowing up the compressed air tank was horrible. Spielberg even considered having Chief Brody kill the shark only to look up and observe several other fins coming towards him."", u'With this film being nominated for 4 Oscars at the 48th Academy Awards in which star Robert Shaw hosted, he became the first person to host the Oscars and die in a movie that was nominated in the same ceremony', u""This movie was rereleased in 2015 for its 40th anniversary. It was released on Fathers Day and Wednesday 3 days later at 2 P.M and 7 P.M on both days. The ending shown in theaters, as well as the 2012 Blu-Ray release, combines the original 1975 version and 2000 version. They combined the sound effect of the shark's death. In the original version, there was a ricochet sound when Brody shot the tank, which was removed in 2000. The Blu-Ray version can be seen when AMC airs it."", u'Olivia Newton-John\'s first hit song ""I Honestly Love You"" is heard in the beach scene when the shark eats Alex Kinter.', u'The licence plate that hooper removes from the sharks body has the number 007 on it. This is a reference to Steven Spielberg always having the desire to direct a James Bond film, being a fan of the James Bond franchise. Also actor Robert Shaw - playing the role of Mr Quint - also plays bond henchmen Red Grant in the James Bond film From Russia With Love.', u'The ending of the movie when the shark blows up was proven to be unrealistic by the show ""Mythbusters"". A more realistic ending would be if only the head was blown off instead of the entire body.', u'Throughout the entire first half of the film, and up to, but not including, the infamous ""Gotta get a bigger boat"" line, every time the actual shark appears (not the threat or possibility of appearance), and then again at the final ""attack run"" sequence, the inconic John Williams\' music (""da-dum, da-dum..."") plays in the background.

The stage-trained Atherton got better with each successive take, but Hawn did her best work on the first two. She did, however, get a second wind if the scene went to 12 takes or more. Spielberg found it best to start with her close-ups. Then he would film Atherton's close-ups until Hawn started to rebound, at which point he could get two shots when they were both at their best."", u'Although the events of the film occur over a couple of days, in reality the events were over with in just a few short hours.', u'Steven Spielberg shot the film in continuity. That made it easier to control production costs, as the size of the entourage following Lou Jean and Clovis grew steadily through the course of the film. It also helped the actors develop their characters more fully.', u'When the caravan is driving through the large crowd in Rodrigo, a bystander hands Lou Jean a piglet as a gift. Lou Jean proceeds to declare, ""He\'s peeing on me!"" several times. According to Steven Spielberg, this is because the piglet did start urinating on Goldie Hawn during the scene.', u""During shooting, Steven Spielberg and cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond had breakfast almost every morning to discuss the work for that day. They agreed to give the film a documentary feel and screened numerous documentaries at night to find ways of solving problems on the set. Zsigmond's practice of using mostly natural lighting helped a great deal in that direction."", u'Most of the smaller roles in the film were cast locally, many with non-actors. Not only did that save on transportation and housing expenses, but Steven Spielberg was able to get memorable, authentic performances from the locals.', u'The Texas landscape was so flat that Steven Spielberg had to place his camera above the road and use a long lens to get more than seven or eight cars within the frame.', u""Universal executives were thrilled with the rough cut until they previewed the film in San Jose, CA, on a double bill with Paper Moon (1973). Audiences were with the film through the first act, particularly liking Goldie Hawn's more comic scenes. When the sharpshooters turned up in the second half, and it became clear this was a more serious film, the mood changed. Some audience members left in tears. Others were angry."", u'To shoot the sequence in the used car lot economically, Steven Spielberg had a six-foot scale model of the lot built by the art department so he could plan out the shots in advance.', u'Steven Spielberg hired John Williams to score the film because he admired his scores for The Reivers (1969) and The Cowboys (1972). Originall he wanted Williams to score the film symphonically, in the style of American composer Aaron Copland. Williams convinced him the film needed something sparser, working mainly with solo harmonica and a few strings.', u""Stunt coordinator Carey Loftin imported the best stunt drivers he could find from Hollywood to make sure the film's car crashes could be filmed safely. The most difficult was the night collision in which a police car sideswipes the stolen police car, leading to a chain reaction as another car hits the sideswiping car and several other cars rear-end each other. Since there were no road lights at the intersection where they filmed, the art director built a tractor rental station on one side of the road and strung 200 50-watt light bulbs over it. That and the lights at a gas station nearby gave cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond all the light he needed to capture the sequence. Steven Spielberg then shot a master shot of the cars approaching each other, but with no collisions, as he couldn't afford any additional cars. Then they got the stunt with four cameras running simultaneously. Loftin drove the car that sideswipes the stolen police car and managed to hit it just right; if he hadn't, they would have had to buy another car for shots of the stolen vehicle."", u""Universal had originally slated the film for a late fall 1973 release but decided not to compete with other big films like its own The Sting (1973). Instead, Universal pushed the film back to February 1974. It also abandoned plans to platform the film, which meant starting with just a few theaters in key cities and letting the audience build slowly. Not having faith in the picture, however, it switched to a wider opening, a sign at the time that it was just trying to burn the film off quickly. Despite strong reviews, the film fared poorly because it didn't have a chance to build word-of-mouth with more discerning audiences. It turned a small profit, but did not do the kind of business Universal had expected for a film starring a top box-office star like Goldie Hawn."", u'The live-action footage playing on the drive-in screen (prior to the Road Runner cartoon) is from the snake thriller Sssssss (1973), also produced by Richard D. Zanuck and David Brown.', u""In the scene where the rifleman is aiming out of the window towards the approaching hijacked car, Steven Spielberg uses a zoom/tracking effect to compress foreground and background elements of the picture (first used by Alfred Hitchcock in Vertigo (1958) to represent James Stewart's character's fear of heights).

During each episode, his character was killed, and during two episodes, his character found himself in Hell. Also directed three episodes of the show.', u'Two segments, and possibly a third, were directed by a young Steven Spielberg. According to the book, ""Rod Serling\'s Night Gallery: An After Hours Tour"", Spielberg was scheduled to direct the 1971 vignette ""A Matter of Semantics"" starring Cesar Romero. Those involved with the production are unclear in their memory as to whether Spielberg actually directed the piece, which was ultimately credited to Jack Laird. At least one actor involved in the 2-minute mini-episode recalls a director who more closely fits Spielberg\'s description than Laird\'s. Beginning with the second season, and despite Rod Serling\'s objections, the producers began to insert brief 1-3 minute ""blackout comedy"" sketches in between main segments of some episodes, usually when an episode was running short. The merits of these brief vignettes remain controversial among Night Gallery (1969) fans to this day.', u'Sculptors Logan Elston and Phil Vanderlei did all of the Night Gallery (1969) sculptures.', u'One year before the debut of the TV series Kung Fu (1972), David Carradine and Radames Pera, who each played the ""Kung Fu"" character of Kwai Chang Caine at different ages throughout that series, appeared in the same episode of ""Night Gallery"", though in different segments. Carradine appeared in ""Phantom Farmhouse"" (episode 2.16) and Pera appeared in ""Silent Snow, Secret Snow"" (episode 2.17).', u'Episodes from the hour long The Sixth Sense (1972), starring Gary Collins, were edited down into half-hours, and added to the Night Gallery syndication package. Studios find it easier to sell programs in syndication when they have more episodes in the package, as local stations know audiences are more likely to grow tired of a program is the same episodes are repeated over and over again within a short period of time. Adding the edited Sixth Sense programs made syndicating the program easier.', u'The syndication version of the series took individual segments from the original hour long program and worked them into half-hour episodes. This sometimes meant editing out footage from original episodes that ran longer than a half hour, or adding footage to those that originally were shorter than a half hour.', u""The set used by Rod Serling to introduce each story contained both paintings and sculptures. Only paintings were used, however, to illustrate a story's title."", u""Rod Serling had originally conceived of a show like Night Gallery when he was still working on The Twilight Zone. He had originally wanted to change the stories to be shown during the final season from fantasy to horror (the genre he preferred), but CBS adamantly refused to agree to it. Unfortunately for Serling, on Night Gallery he did not have the same kind of control over the program like he did on Twilight Zone, as he was just the host and occasional story contributor).
