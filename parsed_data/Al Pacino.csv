British comedy duo Eric Morecambe and Ernie Wise pulled in audiences of more than 20 million in their 1970s heyday; their material is often thought to have deteriorated after 1978 when they left the BBC."", u'The fake nose Matt Damon wears is an in-joke reference to The Brothers Grimm (2005), in which director Terry Gilliam wanted the actor to wear a fake nose but the studio vetoed it.', u'During the film\'s climax, several shots are used of various bystanders. One of them is cashing out a rather large amount of chips.

However, it was ultimately cut from the film, and can be seen on the blu-ray release (under the additional footage section, the ""Meet the Team, Again"" sequence).', u""When discussing the blueprints of the Bank Casino, Rusty mentions that among the architects responsible for the design was Frank Gehry, with whom Brad Pitt has collaborated personally on several projects at Gehry's Los Angeles studio."", u'The ""Five Diamond Award"" is the highest award for hotels and restaurants given out by AAA (formerly the Automobile Association of America).

When the shot pans over to George Clooney, the number ""5150"" is displayed next to him. This corresponds to the health and safety code for placing a psychiatric hold on a deranged individual. In other words, a crazy person is often referred to as a ""5150"" around police and medical circles.', u'When the pit boss is leaving the pawn shop, he passes by a sign showing the word ""Griffin"". The Griffin Agency is famous in Las Vegas for helping casinos spot card counters and cheats. However, in this area of town, The Griffin is a bar located downtown.', u""Peter Fonda, who had appeared in a deleted scene in Ocean's Twelve (2004), was slated to reprise his role as Bobby in this film, but his work on Ghost Rider (2007) prevented him from doing so."", u'Both Al Pacino and Andy Garcia starred in The Godfather: Part III (1990).', u'Linus makes a joke about the 1973 Ch\xe2teau d\'Yquem wine.

The Ocean\'s Trilogy & The Iron Man Trilogy, he also did in ""Iron Man 2"".', u'Linus tells Reuben that Rusty is pulling an ""Irwin Allen"". This is in homage to the producer Irwin Allen who is widely popular for his disaster movies and TV shows that depicted ways the world would end. His one technical contribution to the world of film and TV was his pioneering of the ""shaky-cam"" technique to imply aerial turbulence or an earthquake. His approach was to simply tilt the camera back and forth, and have his actors throw themselves across a set. This goes along with Rusty telling Bank there is a possibility of an earthquake, and their exit plan for the end of the movie to cause one to get all the people to leave with their winnings.', u'The characters make several references to a ""Susan B. Anthony"" in their heist. This is a reference to the Susan B. Anthony dollar manufactured by the US mint in 1979. It was similar in appearance and size to a regular quarter and many people dropped it into a slot machine without realizing what it was worth. This method was used twice in the film, though the people are using an ordinary coin they don\'t realize that it will be worth millions in the slot: first by the woman in The Bank who wins the jackpot and later by the VUP at the slot machine in the airport.', u""All members of the Caldwell (Linus') family that we know of have impersonated some kind of law-enforcing agent in the three 'Ocean' movies.

Nixon, as a Congressman and Senator, was a major figure in the anti-Communist Second Red Scare of 1947-1957 - as was Roy Cohn.

Adamson was a retired police officer, whom Michael Mann had been working with off and on since the film Thief (1981) starring James Caan (and based upon the career of famed Chicago burglar Frank Hohimer whom Adamson had arrested). They had later worked together on two shows produced by Mann: Miami Vice (1984) and Crime Story (1986). According to Chuck Adamson (and confirmed by Michael Mann) in the Heat-Special Edition DVD Documentary ""Crime Stories"", McCauley was a professional robber, with whom he had frequently crossed paths.

In this version, Shiherlis is not stationed on the roof of the projection building, but is instead stationed with Cheritto by the exit gate to shoot the driver. The assassin would also beg Neil to kill him afterwards."", u'In a deleted scene, Nate tells Neil that he and Chris will be set up with new lives in Ireland.', u'Moby\'s two contributions to the soundtrack were originally meant to be reversed, his cover of Joy Division\'s ""New Dawn Fades"" was supposed to play over the closing credits and ""God Moving Over the Face of the Waters"" while Hanna pursues McCauley on the freeway. However, Michael Mann felt ""God Moving"" was such a cathartic piece of music, it was more suited to strike up during McCauley\'s death scene, ending the movie.', u'Earlier drafts had Nate getting caught by Hanna, and facing accessory charges, for the armored car robbery and the bank robbery.', u""Hanna's team of detectives and McCauley's crew are mirror images of each other right to the end: The only detective to die is Hanna's No. 2 man, Bosko.

Much like The Godfather: Part II (1974), the film would follow a parallel narrative in different eras, with one story focusing on Garcia's character, Vincent, leading the Family into the modern era, and the other story following the youth of Vincent's father, Sonny, with Leonardo DiCaprio tipped as Coppola's first choice for the role. Coppola, along with Mario Puzo began work on the story, though Puzo's death cut short the development. Coppola didn't wish to continue without Puzo's involvement, so the project was abandoned. Paramount studios, however, has considered proceeding with a fourth film without Puzo, or even Coppola's involvement (possibly based on the Godfather novels by Mark Winegardner), though as of 2010, no official plans for a fourth film exist."", u'Originally, the script was to center around Tom and Michael. Tom was going to be an informant. When Robert Duvall got the script he realized his character was the second lead, yet the studio was offering the same amount of money as he received for the last film (around 1/9th the money all the other principals received). Duvall counteroffered through Francis Ford Coppola to Paramount. Paramount denied offering more money and told Coppola to re-write the script without Tom.

It dissolves to a church service sequence in which a gunman guns down Michael before getting shot and it ends with Michael lying to Kay for the last time before he dies.

Although unused in the film, a clip of Calo snapping Lucchesi's neck was included in the film's official trailer."", u'The character of Joey Zasa was based on two mob kingpins of the 1960s and early 1970s. One was Joe Columbo, who organized the Italian-American Civil Rights League, which was supposedly a civil rights organization but was actually intended to stop FBI investigations into mob activities. Colombo embarrassed others in the Cosa Nostra by keeping a high public profile and enraged Mafia bigwigs when they discovered he was making a fortune from the organization and not sharing any of the money with them. He was shot in New York\'s Columbus Circle (though he didn\'t die until several years later) during a rally by his organization. The hitman, a black gangster, was immediately shot and killed by ""person or persons unknown"", according to police reports. The other is Joe Gallo, who organized the hit on Colombo, was known (and reviled by other mobsters) for recruiting blacks and Hispanics into his crew and hung out with several Hollywood and Broadway celebrities, including actor Jerry Orbach.', u""The final sequence (Mary's murder) was inspired by a real-life murder by stray shot of sound designer Richard Beggs' daughter."", u""Francis Ford Coppola lobbied intensely for the film to be called 'The Death of Michael Corleone' rather than 'The Godfather Part III' but in the end was overruled by the studio.

Kenzig the banker was based on Roberto Calvi, managing director of the Bank of Milan who was found hanged in London in June 19, 1982. He was accused by Italian authorities of being involved in the disappearance of Vatican funds amounting to $1.25 billion. Lucchesi was based on Giulio Andreotti, an Italian politician and former Prime Minister. Gilday was based on Paul Marcinkus, a one-time director of the Vatican Bank who to this day has remained silent about the conspiracy."", u""Michael Corleone's funeral was written and rehearsed, but not shot."", u""The movie provides a fictional explanation for several events surrounding the real-life scandals of the Vatican Bank, from 1978 to 1982. Most notably, the film depicts the alleged murder of Pope John Paul I, who was found dead sitting up in his bed on September 29, 1978, only 33 days after assuming the papacy. Journalist David Yallop has speculated that John Paul I died after drinking poisoned tea (as depicted in the film), the victim of a conspiracy by archbishops and cardinals who were fearful of the new pope's planned reforms for the Vatican Bank (the character of Archbishop Gilday is based on Paul Marcinkus, a Chicago-born archbishop who was the head of the Vatican Bank at the time). Also in the film, the murder of the Swiss banker Frederick Keinszig mirrors the real-life death of Italian banker Roberto Calvi, president of the Banco Ambrosiano. In 1982 the bank--which had strong ties to both the Vatican Bank and the Sicilian Mafia--collapsed largely due to Calvi's shady international money exchanges. On June 18, 1982, Calvi (who had fled Italy to escape indictment) was found hanging from the Blackfriar's Bridge in London, with $15,000 in various currencies in his pocket. His death was first ruled a suicide, then later a murder. In 2005 five people--including two Sicilian gangsters--were indicted for Calvi's murder, but all were acquitted in 2007. Additionally in the film, the Sicilian Don Licio Lucchesi is a loose caricature of former Italian Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti, who had ties to the Sicilian Mafia early in his career but who later turned on them. With Lucchesi's thick glasses and ever-present bodyguard, the caricature of Andreotti would be very recognizable to Italian audiences."", u""Although being credited as one of the three editors, Lisa Fruchtman worked only on the final five minutes of the film, from Mary's murder until Michael's death.""]","[u'USA::12 December 1990 (Beverly Hills, California)\n (premiere)', u'USA::25 December 1990', u'Norway::24 January 1991', u'Germany::18 February 1991 (Berlin International Film Festival)', u'Germany::21 February 1991', u'Austria::22 February 1991', u'Australia::28 February 1991', u'Spain::1 March 1991', u'UK::8 March 1991', u'Ireland::8 March 1991', u'Italy::8 March 1991', u'Japan::8 March 1991', u'Uruguay::8 March 1991', u'Brazil::15 March 1991', u'Finland::15 March 1991', u'Portugal::15 March 1991', u'Sweden::15 March 1991', u'South Korea::16 March 1991', u'Hong Kong::21 March 1991', u'Denmark::22 March 1991', u'Netherlands::22 March 1991', u'Turkey::22 March 1991', u'France::27 March 1991', u'Greece::3 May 1991', u'Hungary::3 May 1991', u'Argentina::16 May 1991', u'Czech Republic::1 January 1993', u'France::8 September 2009 (Deauville Film Festival)', u'Japan::20 November 2010 (Toyohashi Slowtown Cinema Festival)', u'China::20 April 2015 (Beijing International Film Festival)']",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

He had moved to Paris to be away from a plentiful supply of the drug in the U.S.', u'When director Brian De Palma submitted the film to the MPAA, they gave it an ""X rating"".

He yet again made some further cuts and submitted it a third time; yet again it was given an ""X"". De Palma refused to cut the film any further to qualify it for an R. He and producer Martin Bregman arranged a hearing with the MPAA. They brought in a panel of experts, including real narcotics officers, who stated that not only was the film an accurate portrayal of real life in the drug underworld, but ultimately it was an anti-drug film, and should be widely seen. This convinced the arbitrators that the third submitted cut of the film deserved an ""R rating"" by a vote of 18-2. However, De Palma surmised that if the third cut of the film was judged an ""R"" then the very first cut should have been an ""R"" as well. He asked the studio if he could release the first cut but was told that he couldn\'t. However since the Studio execs really didn\'t know the differences between the different cuts that had been submitted, De Palma released the first cut of the film to theaters anyway.

For a scene requiring mock brain-scans of the possessed lead character, he shot a real-life radiologist and his assistant, Paul Bateson. In 1979 Friedkin was planning an adaptation of Gerald Walker\'s novel ""Cruising"", inspired by a real-life serial killer who was carving up ""leather boys"" in the city\'s underground gay bars and dumping their body parts in the Hudson River, wrapped in black plastic bags. When Friedkin learned that his ""Exorcist"" radiologist assistant Bateson was awaiting trial for the post-coital slaying of gay film critic Addison Verrill, Friedkin decided to pay him a visit to do a little research into the psyche of his cruising killer. Bateson was later sentenced to life in prison for the Verrill murder, but not before dropping hints while in custody that he was also the body bag killer.

Police traced items of recovered clothing to a shop in Greenwich Village, catering to gays, and distinctive tattoos identified one of the victims as a well known member of the gay community. Because several of the cases involved unidentified persons and there was no confirmed cause of death, the crimes were not officially classified as homicides but were listed as CUPPI\'s--circumstances undetermined pending police investigation. One of the cases was solved due to evidence collected in an ""unrelated"" case. On September 14, 1977, film critic Addison Verrill was beaten and stabbed to death in his New York apartment.

After having sex at Verrill\'s flat, Bateson admitted to crushing his victim\'s skull with a metal skillet, afterward stabbing Verrill in the heart. Convicted of the homicide on March 5, 1979, he was sentenced to a term of 20 years to life in prison. While in custody awaiting trial, Bateson bragged of killing other men ""for fun,"" dismembering their bodies and dropping the bagged remains in the Hudson River. This case inspired the novel upon which this film was based. Detectives were satisfied that Bateson actually was the serial killer they had been looking for, but lack of solid evidence resulted in his not being charged with them.', u'In an effort to make the scenes of gay ""leather bars"" as real as possible, actual leather bars in New York City that catered to gay men were used. These locations are in Manhattan\'s lower West Side neighborhoods in the meat packing district, most of which remain open to this day. The extras in full black leather and chaps, among other provocative sexual attire, were actual patrons of the bars recruited for the scenes a few days before filming began. They were instructed to act as they would normally act in gay bars, but to tone down sexually-oriented activities because of the likelihood these acts would give the film an ""X"" rating.', u'Al Pacino makes his first appearance 15 minutes into the film.', u""Angered over reports of the film's negative portrayal of gay life that leaked out during shooting, activists distributed hundreds of whistles to members of New York City's gay community and encouraged them to spoil exterior filming on city streets by blowing them loudly whenever they spotted a crew from the film shooting on location, a tactic that cost the studio a considerable amount of money that had to be spent on lost production time and post-dubbing."", u""Joe Spinell made this movie before Maniac (1980), playing a brutal, closeted police officer in the early scenes. His character mentions his wife leaving him and moving down to Florida with their young daughter to live with his wife's sister. In real life, Spinell's wife, porn star Jean Jennings, divorced him several weeks before he filmed his scenes and moved to Florida--exactly as his character describes."", u'The L.A. punk band The Germs recorded five or so songs expressly for the soundtrack to this movie, although only ""Lion\'s Share"" was actually used. During the recording sessions, director William Friedkin was so energized by the Germs\' playing that he took to doing the ""pogo"" dance around the engineer\'s booth.', u'During a murder scene in a room at the St. James Hotel where a man is stabbed to death on a bed, director William Friedkin edited in several near-subliminal frames from a gay hardcore movie that can clearly be seen in slow motion on DVD.', u""Most of Karen Allen's performance ended up on the cutting room floor."", u'In addition to protests that occurred when the film was released, the production itself was plagued by demonstrations protesting it. Protesters would clog streets, make lots of noise--in order to ruin live recorded sound--and even climb up on rooftops and shine lights with reflectors down on to the set,k to disrupt the lighting and distract the crew.', u'The plot, about murders of the patrons of gay nightclubs, caused many to protest the release of the film. In fact, organized protests by gay groups were planned on the day the film was released. The public largely ignored the protests.', u'Robert De Niro and Roy Scheider turned down the role of Steve Burns.', u""William Friedkin returned to the project after some well-publicized murders were committed in New York City's gay community were committed. He remembered the project that The French Connection (1971) producer Philip D'Antoni had first talked to him about a few years earlier, which eventually resulted in this film being made."", u'The film was part of a cycle of mainstream Hollywood movies featuring gay partnerships and drag characters. Others included Making Love (1982), Victor Victoria (1982), Partners (1982), Tootsie (1982) and Personal Best (1982).', u'Paul Morrissey was going to direct with Jeff Bridges as Steve Burns and Jan-Michael Vincent as Stuart Richards.', u""William Friedkin initially wasn't interested in the project when producer Philip D'Antoni first brought it to his attention. D'Antoni then tried Steven Spielberg who dropped out when--not surprisingly--none of the major studios were prepared to back it."", u'Throughout the summer of 1979, members of New York\'s gay community protested against the production of the film. Gay people were urged to disrupt filming and gay-owned businesses to bar the filmmakers from their premises. People attempted to interfere with shooting by pointing mirrors from rooftops to ruin lighting for scenes, blasting whistles and air horns near locations, and playing loud music. One thousand protesters marched through the East Village demanding the city withdraw support for the film. Al Pacino said that he understood the protests but insisted that upon reading the screenplay he never at any point felt that the film was anti-gay. He said that the leather bars were ""just a fragment of the gay community, the same way the Mafia is a fragment of Italian-American life"", referring to The Godfather (1972), and that he would ""never want to do anything to harm the gay community"".', u'The title is a play on words with a dual meaning, as ""cruising"" can describe police officers on patrol and also cruising for sex.', u""James A.

Rechy had written an essay defending Friedkin\'s right to make the film, although not defending the film itself. At Rechy\'s suggestion, Friedkin deleted a scene showing the Gay Liberation slogan ""We Are Everywhere"" as graffiti on a wall just before the first body part is pulled from the river, and added a disclaimer: ""This film is not intended as an indictment of the homosexual world. It is set in one small segment of that world, which is not meant to be representative of the whole."" Friedkin later claimed that it was the MPAA and United Artists that required the disclaimer, calling it ""part of the dark bargain that was made to get the film released at all"" and ""a sop to organized gay rights groups"". Friedkin claimed that no one involved in making the film thought it would be considered as representative of the entire gay community, but gay film historian Vito Russo disputes that, citing the disclaimer as ""an admission of guilt. What director would make such a statement if he truly believed that his film would not be taken to be representative of the whole?""', u'Timothy Bottoms was considered for the role of Steve Burns.']","[u'USA::8 February 1980 (New York City, New York)\n (premiere)', u'USA::15 February 1980', u'Australia::12 June 1980', u'Sweden::28 July 1980', u'Spain::14 August 1980 (Barcelona)', u'Netherlands::21 August 1980', u'West Germany::25 August 1980', u'France::23 September 1980', u'Italy::28 October 1980', u'Norway::28 October 1980', u'Japan::10 January 1981', u'Denmark::16 January 1981', u'Portugal::12 February 1981', u'Hong Kong::27 February 1981', u'Brazil::18 May 1981', u'Uruguay::29 May 1981', u'Mexico::24 September 1981', u'Argentina::7 January 1982', u'Italy::20 July 1982 (Mystfest)', u'Turkey::July 1989', u'USA::12 May 1995 (re-release)', u'Italy::December 1997 (Noir in Festival)', u'Italy::November 2003 (Turin Film Festival)', u'France::23 May 2007 (Cannes Film Festival)', u'Greece::September 2007 (Athens Film Festival)', u'Spain::9 October 2007 (Sitges Film Festival)', u'Greece::9 October 2007 (DVD premiere)', u'Germany::27 June 2015 (Munich International Film Festival)']",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Ellis Island immigrants were marked with this if the inspector believed the person had a mental defect.', u'Originally, the actors in the flashback scenes wore pants with zippers. One of the musicians pointed out that the zipper had not been invented at that time, so some scenes had to be re-shot with button-fly trousers.', u'Francis Ford Coppola had a horrible time directing The Godfather (1972) and asked to pick a different director for the sequel, while taking the title of producer for himself. He chose Martin Scorsese, whom the film executives rejected. Thus, Coppola agreed to direct the film, with a few conditions.', u'This was the first sequel to win the Academy Award for Best Picture. The second, and as of 2016 the last, was The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003).', u""In the scene in which young Vito negotiates with Signor Roberto on the street, a passerby interrupts to say hello to Vito.

After all, I am a grandfather.""', u'As of 2016, Robert De Niro is one of only six actors (with Sophia Loren, Christoph Waltz, Roberto Benigni, Benicio Del Toro, and Marion Cotillard) to win an Academy Award for a role primarily in a language other than English, since almost all of his dialogue in this film is in Italian.', u""The door to Vito's olive oil business was rigged so that it would not open if a nail was inserted into the lock.

He agreed on several conditions - that the sequel be interconnected with the first film with the intention of later showing them together; that he be allowed to direct his own script of The Conversation (1974); that he be allowed to direct a production for the San Francisco Opera; and that he be allowed to write the screenplay for The Great Gatsby (1974) - all prior to production of the sequel for a Christmas 1974 release.', u'Originally, it was supposed to be Clemenza who agrees to testify against the Corleones. According to Francis Ford Coppola, Richard S. Castellano (who was the highest paid actor in The Godfather (1972)) wanted to write his own lines and wanted a large salary increase. Consequently, his character was replaced by Frankie Pentangeli (Michael V. Gazzo), who received an Oscar nomination for the performance. But according to Ardell Sheridan, Castellano refused to regain the 50 pounds required to for the role due to health reasons, so Coppola decided to replace him rather than have a thinner Clemenza.', u""Though never explicitly stated in the film, Anita Colombo (the old woman evicted from her apartment that a young Vito helps out) is the grandmother of Sandra Corleone, Sonny's wife."", u'The film takes place in 1901, 1917, 1920, 1923, 1941, 1958, 1959 and 1960.', u""Francis Ford Coppola considered bringing Marlon Brando back to play Vito Corleone as a young man, convinced that he could play at any age.

They found cutting back and forth between Michael and young Vito confusing and bothersome. Francis Ford Coppola and his editors decided to decrease the frequency of the transitions in order to make the parallel stories easier to follow.', u'The early buzz on The Godfather (1972) was so positive that a sequel was planned before the film was even finished filming.', u'Robert De Niro auditioned for and was almost cast in The Godfather (1972) in a minor role. When Francis Ford Coppola was casting this film, he saw Mean Streets (1973) and knew he wanted De Niro for a major role in this sequel.', u""Although Nino Rota's score for The Godfather (1972) was withdrawn from an Oscar nomination because he reused the same theme from his previous score for Fortunella: Ruhtinatar laitakadulta (1958), he was still awarded the Oscar for Best Original Score for the sequel, even though it used the same love theme from the first film."", u'Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo won the Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay even though half of the script was adapted and half was original.

On the DVD commentary track, Coppola detailed how he visited Kazan with the request, and remembered that Kazan was bare-chested. As an homage, Roth (Lee Strasberg) is bare-chested when Michael Corleone visits him.', u'According to Francis Ford Coppola on the DVD commentary, G.D. Spradlin wrote many of his own lines, including his anti-Italian speech to Michael.', u""Bruno Kirby, who plays the young Clemenza (who was played by Richard S.

In particular, he had hoped Michael would become a Senator. Michael assured him, ""We\'ll get there, Pop."" At the opening of this film, we see Michael explicitly rebuffing the demands of a US Senator, turning the tables by making demands of his own.', u""The golden telephone presented to Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista is based on an actual event.

In actual fact, the British film Enemy from Space (1957) was the first (released 17 years earlier). The Godfather Part II is the first US film sequel to use such numbering though.', u'Unlike with the first film, Francis Ford Coppola was given near-complete control over production. In his commentary, he said this resulted in a shoot that ran very smoothly despite multiple locations and two narratives running parallel within one film.', u'Vito\'s birthday is December 7. Sonny curses at the ""Japs"" for dropping bombs in Hawaii on his father\'s birthday.', u'Timothy Carey, who had turned down the offer to play Luca Brasi in the original, was offered the role of Don Fanucci in this film. While performing his audition at Paramount Studios in which Francis Ford Coppola and Martin Scorsese were present, Carey pulled a prop gun loaded with blanks out of a pastry box he had with him, and fired a shot at Coppola, before pretending to commit suicide. Reports differ as to whether Coppola immediately offered Carey the role, or whether Carey was removed by security. In addition, the actor made several monetary demands that caused him to be passed over.', u'The line in the movie, ""Michael, we\'re bigger than U.S. Steel"" was voted as the #54 of ""The 100 Greatest Movie Lines"" by Premiere in 2007.', u'The film cast includes five Oscar winners: Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, Robert De Niro, Robert Duvall and Sofia Coppola; and seven Oscar nominees: Talia Shire, Michael V.

The bills used are series 1914 large size $10 Federal Reserve Notes. Large size notes measure 7-3/8 by 3-1/8 inches compared to the small note, printed from 1928 to the present, measuring 6-1/8 by 2-5/8 inches.', u'When Francis Ford Coppola decided to replace Richard S. Castellano, Willi Cicci was planned to be the sole testifier against the Corleones before the character of Pentangeli was created.', u""Production nearly ended before it began when Al Pacino's lawyers told Francis Ford Coppola that he had grave misgivings with the script and was not coming. Coppola spent an entire night rewriting it before giving it to Pacino for his review. Pacino approved and the production went forward."", u""One of Francis Ford Coppola's conditions on returning to direct was that Robert Evans have no involvement whatsoever with the film, as they had frequently clashed while making the first film."", u""After the first film, Francis Ford Coppola joked that the only sequel he'd make is Abbott and Costello Meet The Godfather (1972). It took a lot of arm-twisting by Paramount to change his mind."", u""Robert De Niro became the only actor to win an Oscar for taking over another actor's Oscar-winning performance. He was not, however, the first or last such actor to be nominated for this. G\xe9rard Depardieu was nominated for Best Actor in Cyrano de Bergerac (1990), a role that had already won an Oscar for Jos\xe9 Ferrer. Like Brando, Ferrer had played his role in English. Like DeNiro, Depardieu played the role in the character's native language; in this case French. Years later, Jeff Bridges would be nominated for his performance in True Grit (1969). John Wayne had won his only Oscar for his performance in the original film, which also featured Robert Duvall."", u""Vittorio Storaro turned down the chance to be the film's cinematographer as he felt that a sequel would never match the original The Godfather (1972)."", u'In the original script, Don Ciccio was named Don Francesco. ""Ciccio"" is a Sicilian nickname for Francesco. He is still listed as Don Francesco in closing credits.', u'The orchestra that plays in the band shell during the party scene at Lake Tahoe was actually the Al Tronti Orchestra that played nightly for big names like Elvis Presley and Tom Jones at the Sahara Tahoe Casino/Hotel on the South Shore of Lake Tahoe while this film was being shot. Al Tronti himself sits in the orchestra in the front room (only seen in shadow). He wasn\'t allowed to appear as the orchestra conductor since he looked ""too Italian"" and the orchestra in the movie was supposed to be a West Coast group that not able to play any traditional Italian music.', u'Al Pacino worked extensively with Marlon Brando and Richard S. Castellano in the first film, but he worked with neither of their replacements in this film. Decades later, however, he would have the chance.

But in the shooting script he is named ""Bussetta.""', u'Just as in the first film (and in the novel), there are elements of the story based on the lives of New York gangster ""Crazy"" Joe Gallo and his brothers. In this film, when Frank Pantangelli is ambushed in the bar and nearly garroted by the Rosato brothers, that incident was based on an attack by Carmine ""the Snake"" Persico against Crazy Joe\'s brother, Larry Gallo. As in the film, Larry was lured to the bar for a ""sit down"" meeting with Persico, who was his friend.

That accounts for Al Pacino's additional wrinkles and slightly receded and graying hairline. It was actually the concluding aspect of a scene with his son, Anthony, who declares he will not follow in his father's footsteps.

When Pacino asked Serpico, ""Why did you do it?"" Serpico replied, ""Well, Al, I don\'t know. I guess I would have to say it would be because... if I didn\'t, who would I be when I listened to a piece of music?""', u""The film ends with the words on the screen saying that Serpico is living somewhere in Switzerland. In fact, Frank Serpico discovered he didn't like Switzerland and returned to the U.S. As of 2015, he was living on a small farm in upstate N.Y., and working as a guest-lecturer at police academies across the United States."", u'Al Pacino considers this movie to be one of his greatest achievements as an actor.', u""After spending a lot of time with Al Pacino as he prepared for the role, the real Serpico wanted to remain on the set during filming. Producer Martin Bregman said he had to hurt Serpico's feelings and ordered him to leave because he believed that his presence would prove a distraction."", u""According to Sidney Lumet, Al Pacino always needed to be in the character's state of mind in any given scene and could not shed that state off camera, so he behaved accordingly at all times, either happy, joking, and laughing for a lighthearted scene or angry and lashing out at everyone if the scene they were working on called for that behavior."", u'Sidney Lumet was pleased with the cooperation of the NYPD, especially in light of the subject matter and the proximity in time to the actual events depicted in the movie. Two officers were directly assigned to the movie, and Lumet wondered what their reaction would be. ""As soon as they saw the truth we were going for, how it was not a Hollywood version, they not only weren\'t a problem, they more actively helped,"" he noted.', u'Shot on 104 different locations in every borough of New York City except Staten Island.', u'The film was scheduled to open by Christmas. That left four and a half months for shooting, editing, and mixing, an ""insanely short time"" in Sidney Lumet\'s estimation. Therefore, the editing had to take place during filming. Without the luxury of time, it was necessary to finish shooting a scene and rush it to editor Dede Allen, who had to cut the footage within 48 hours and have it ready for delivery to the sound department.', u""Principal photography began a year after Serpico's resignation from the police force."", u'Al Pacino would sometimes go in character to different neighborhoods, some of them dangerous. One story has it that Pacino was so in character that he pulled over a truck driver and threatened to arrest him for exhaust pollution.', u'Associate Producer Roger Rothstein gave Sidney Lumet high marks as ""a tremendously organized director"" who was able to motivate everyone to do as many as 35 set-ups in a single day.', u'Surprisingly, this subject was first planned as a star vehicle for Paul Newman and Robert Redford, following their success in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969). Redford was to play Frank Serpico and Newman was to play his lawyer friend David Durk (a character renamed ""Bob Blair"" in the final film, where he is played by Tony Roberts).', u'Before shooting began, Sidney Lumet and the production company had to cast 107 speaking parts. They decided to use mostly unknown actors. Lumet said the best way to strengthen the sense of reality was not to use actors for whom audiences had a lot of previous associations. Even Al Pacino, despite his high exposure in The Godfather (1972), was still relatively new.', u""The actors were allowed to do some improvisation in their scenes. Much of Al Pacino's explosive reaction in Serpico's last abortive meeting with his former captain was off the cuff."", u'Sidney Lumet liked to do very simple things on the first day of shooting, like basic entrances and exits, to let actors and crew get used to each other and make them aware that things will move very quickly. He will often shoot just a single take and move quickly to another set-up. He said this process also helps to spot weak links in his team. The first day on this film, he worked at three different, fairly far-flung locations. Al Pacino was initially stunned, especially after coming off the methodically low, deliberate process of The Godfather (1972). But he and the rest of the cast soon learned that this fast pace had the benefit of keeping the inner tension of the narrative and the characters alive.', u'The aria, Serpico is listening in his garden is ""E lucevan le stelle"" (""And the stars were shining"") from Giacomo Puccini\'s opera Tosca. An opera that also deals with - among other things - corruption and abuse of power.', u'Speaking of the production in a later interview, Sidney Lumet said, ""Serpico, just physically and in terms of logistics, gives you the problem of keeping your emotional theme work in perspective. You have to ask yourself not only \'Where am I physically?\' but \'Where am I emotionally?\' I think I was more tired after finishing Serpico than almost any movie I\'ve ever done. There was also the obligation to the real Frank Serpico--to be honest with his life and not exploit it.""', u'Playwright Sidney Kingsley loaned his apartment to Sidney Lumet for use to film the party scene. In 1935, Kingsley hired an 11-year-old Lumet to appear on Broadway in his play, ""Dead End"", and they had remained friends since then.', u""Al Pacino's residence in the movie is located at 5-7 Minetta Street in Manhattan's Greenwich Village.

Francis Ford Coppola told Variety, ""There were many people killed in that movie, but everyone worries about the horse. It was the same on the set.

The extra\'s frightened reaction is genuine. Caan also came up with the idea of throwing money at the man to make up for breaking his camera. As he put it, ""Where I came from, you broke something, you replaced it or repaid the owner.""', u'There was intense friction between Francis Ford Coppola and Paramount, in which [Paramount] frequently tried to have Coppola replaced, citing his inability to stay on schedule, unnecessary expenses, and production and casting errors (Coppola actually completed the film ahead of schedule and budget).', u'The scenes in which Enzo comes to visit Vito Corleone in the hospital were shot in reverse, with the outside scene shot first. Gabriele Torrei, the actor who plays Enzo, had never acted in front of a camera before and his nervous shaking, after the car drives away, was real.', u'Whenever oranges appear in the film, they foreshadow death or a near death involving the Corleone family.', u'Note the attention to detail: most of the cars have wooden bumpers. Bumpers were removed by car owners during the war and replaced with wooden ones. The chrome ones were turned in to help with the war effort. After the war, it took years for them to be replaced.', u""The cat held by Marlon Brando in the opening scene was a stray that Coppola found while on the lot at Paramount, and was not originally called for in the script. So content was the cat that its purring muffled some of Brando's dialogue, and, as a result, most of his lines had to be looped."", u'According to Francis Ford Coppola, the film took 62 days to shoot.', u'The smack that Vito gives Johnny Fontane was not in the script.

Coppola went on to explain there are expectations of reciprocity once one is provided a ""favor"" by an organized crime member or otherwise involved in a business action with the same. He specifically denied the connection of Gianni Russo to organized crime. The closest Coppola claims to have come to a real gangster during production, at least to his knowledge, was an interaction with Lenny Montana, who played Luca Brasi. Coppola said, when he asked if Montana knew how to spin the cylinder of the revolver, Montana replied, ""You kiddin\'?""', u""Orson Welles lobbied to get the part of Don Vito Corleone, even offering to lose a good deal of weight in order to get the role.

However, it was widely assumed that it was, and Sinatra was furious; when he met Puzo at a restaurant, he screamed vulgar terms and threats at Puzo. Sinatra was also vehemently opposed to the film. Due to this backlash, Fontane's role in the film was scaled down to a couple of scenes."", u'For the scene where Clemenza is cooking, Francis Ford Coppola originally wrote in the script, ""Clemenza browns some sausage.""

Now let\'s work through where we go from here."" When Michael returns from the bathroom, he continues in Sicilian with, ""Everything all right? I respect myself, understand, and cannot allow another man to hold me back. What happened was unavoidable. I had the unspoken support of the other Family dons. If your father were in better health, without his eldest son running things, no disrespect intended, we wouldn\'t have this nonsense. We will stop fighting until your father is well and can resume bargaining. No vengeance will be taken. We will have peace.

Both were assassinated with a shot through the eye, with the glasses worn by Greene being necessary in order to accomplish the special effect eye shot.', u'Director Francis Ford Coppola worked with relatives in this film, (making it a family film in many contexts). In chronological order of appearance: his sister, Talia Shire, portrayed Connie Corleone throughout the trilogy, his mother, Italia Coppola, serves as an extra in the restaurant meeting, his father, Carmine Coppola, is the piano player in the Mattress sequence and, he composed the music, his sons Gian-Carlo Coppola and Roman Coppola, can be seen as extras in the scene where Sonny beats up Carlo, and he is at the funeral, and his daughter, Sofia Coppola, is the baby, Michael Rizzi, in the baptism (she was three weeks old at the time of shooting).', u""Francis Ford Coppola was reluctant to let his sister, Talia Shire, audition for the role of Connie. He felt she was too pretty for the part and did not want to be accused of nepotism. Only at Mario Puzo's request did Shire get a chance to audition."", u'Because Corleone, Sicily, was too developed, even in the early 1970s, the Sicilian town of Savoca, outside Taormina, was used for shooting the scenes where Michael is in exile in Italy.', u""One of the reasons why Francis Ford Coppola finally agreed to direct the film was because he was in debt to Warner Brothers, following $400,000 budget overruns on George Lucas's THX 1138 (1971). Lucas urged him to take the job."", u'George Lucas put together the ""Mattress Sequence"" (the montage of crime scene photos and headlines about the war between the five families) as a favor to Francis Ford Coppola for helping him fund American Graffiti (1973). He asked not to be credited. Lucas used photos from real crime scenes. The one pictured is Frank ""The Enforcer"" Nitti, Al Capone\'s right-hand man who had not been murdered, but actually shot himself. During the scene Coppola\'s father Carmine Coppola is the piano player.', u'Francis Ford Coppola insisted on the film being called ""Mario Puzo\'s The Godfather"" rather than just ""The Godfather,"" because his original draft of the screenplay was so faithful to Puzo\'s novel, he thought Puzo deserved the credit for it.', u""In 1974, the film premiered on NBC over two nights: Saturday, November 16th, and Monday, November 18th, from 9-11 PM. Both nights, at 11 PM, New York City's Municipal Water Authorities had some overflow problems from all the toilets flushing around the same time."", u'Gianni Russo used his organized crime connections to secure the role of Carlo Rizzi, going so far as to get a camera crew to film his own audition and send it to the producers. However, Marlon Brando was initially against having Russo, who had never acted before, in the film; this made Russo furious and he went to threaten Brando. However, this reckless act proved to be a blessing in disguise, because Brando thought Russo was acting and was convinced he would be good for the role.', u'Al Pacino wore a foam latex facial appliance that covered his entire left cheek and was made up with colors to match his skin tone and give the effect of bruising, to simulate the effect of having his jaw broken by Captain McCluskey.', u""Francis Ford Coppola turned in an initial director's cut running 126 minutes. Paramount production chief Robert Evans rejected this version and demanded a longer cut with more scenes about the family. The final release version was nearly 50 minutes longer than Coppola's initial cut."", u""The three-year-old child actor, Anthony Gounaris, responded best when his real name was used while shooting the film. That is why Michael's son's name is Anthony."", u'Richard S.

He later regretted refusing the offer, but would go on to direct his own critically acclaimed gangster film, Once Upon a Time in America (1984).', u'A young Sylvester Stallone auditioned for the roles of Paulie Gatto and Carlo Rizzi, but was not cast for either. Stallone instead decided to try his hand at writing, first completing the screenplay for the modestly successful The Lords of Flatbush (1974). He would later get his break in Rocky (1976), alongside Talia Shire, who portrays Connie Corleone in this film.', u'Stanley Kubrick thought the film had the best cast ever and could be the best movie ever made.', u""In many of the Sicily scenes, Michael wipes his nose with a handkerchief. The novel explains that McCluskey's punch did damage to his sinuses."", u'During pre-production, Francis Ford Coppola shot his own unofficial screen tests with Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, and Diane Keaton at his home in San Francisco. Robert Evans was unimpressed by them and insisted that official screen tests be held. The studio spent $420,000 on the screen tests but in the end, the actors Coppola originally wanted were hired.', u'The scenes of Michael and Kay at the wedding at the beginning were actually shot at night. Due to the rushed schedule, Francis Ford Coppola had to get their scenes in the bag. Cinematographer Gordon Willis was furious at having to rig up so many lights.', u""When Vito Corleone has his brush with death, there is a poster of Jake LaMotta hanging on a building wall behind the fruit vendor. Robert De Niro later won an Oscar for playing both of those characters on film (see The Godfather: Part II (1974)). In addition, the final scene of Raging Bull (1980) features DeNiro, as LaMotta, repeating Marlon Brando's monologue from the end of On the Waterfront (1954). That role, like this one, earned Brando an Oscar."", u""Al Pacino's first Oscar nomination marks his first of four consecutive nominations, a feat he shares with Jennifer Jones (1943-1946), Thelma Ritter (1950-1953), Marlon Brando (1951-1954), Elizabeth Taylor (1957-1960), and Susan Sarandon (1992-1996)."", u'Al Pacino, James Caan and Diane Keaton were all paid $35,000 for their work on the film.', u""When Marlon Brando won the Best Actor Oscar for this movie, he sent Sacheen Littlefeather (n\xe9e Marie Louise Cruz) to represent him at the awards ceremonies. The presenters of the award were Roger Moore and Liv Ullmann. When Moore offered the statuette to Littlefeather, she snubbed him and proceeded with her speech about the film industry's mistreatment of Native Americans."", u'James Caan originally heard the phrase ""bada-bing!"" from his acquaintance, the real-life mobster Carmine Persico, and improvised its use in the film.', u'The only comment Robert Duvall made about his performance was that he wished ""they would have made a better hairpiece"" for his character.', u'Radio personality Howard Stern has said that he would gladly have any cast member of this film as his guest, and they can show up at his studio unannounced. Though over the years, cast members such as Robert Duvall and James Caan were pre-scheduled guests, his ""just show up"" policy was never taken up until Gianni Russo arrived one day. Stern immediately had him escorted into his studio, even though he was in the midst of other guests at the time, and interviewed him.', u'There was a great deal of mooning on set, started by James Caan and Robert Duvall. In an effort to break some tension during a rehearsal for the first scene, the pair mooned Francis Ford Coppola, Marlon Brando and Salvatore Corsitto. Caan told Time Magazine, ""My best moon was on Second Avenue. Bob Duvall and I were in one car and Brando was in another, so we drove up beside him and I pulled down my pants and stuck my ass out the window. Brando fell down in the car with laughter."" Richard Bright claimed that it got to the point where every time you turned opened a door, you expected to see someone\'s behind. Even Al Pacino got in on the act, as he told Ladies\' Home Journal, ""In a scene where I sit behind a desk, wardrobe made a big fuss about getting me a shirt with a smaller collar. So while everyone was looking at the shirt, I took off my pants. When I came out from behind the desk, I got a laugh, even though we had to do the scene over."" The ultimate moon came when Brando and Duvall mooned 400 cast and crew members during the shooting of the wedding scene. They planned it carefully and Caan, who overheard the plan, started to shout, ""No, no, not here!"" Everyone working on the production and most of the extras roared with laughter (some of the older ladies didn\'t appreciate the view). Eventually, Brando was crowned best prankster, designated by a heavyweight-style leather belt with the title, ""Moon Champion.""', u'Paramount executive Peter Bart bought the film rights to Mario Puzo\'s ""The Godfather"" before it was even finished. It was still only a 20-page outline.', u""Cinematographer Gordon Willis was forced to use overhead lighting for Marlon Brando's scenes, because of his makeup. He decided to extend it throughout, which is one reason the movie is so dark. Source: Visions of Light (1992)."", u'The film was set and shot in New York, at over 100 locations. Originally, the entire film was to be shot in the Hollywood back lots in order to save production costs. However, production designer Dean Tavoularis threatened to add two stories to each back lot building in order to replicate the look of New York City, and the studio relented and allowed for shooting in New York.', u'Jewish actors James Caan and Abe Vigoda portray Italian characters (Santino Corleone and Salvatore Tessio), while Italian Alex Rocco portrays a Jewish character (Moe Greene).', u'According to Albert S. Ruddy\'s assistant, Bettye McCartt, Ruddy was warned by police that the Mafia was following his car. Ruddy would switch cars with McCartt in an effort to lose them. One night, McCartt found her car with the windows shot out and a note that read, ""Shut down the movie or else.""', u""The Don's wife, Carmella Corleone, is seen singing at the wedding. Morgana King, who played Carmella, was a gifted jazz singer, and portraying Carmella was actually her film debut, as well as her acting debut."", u'George Lucas used photos from real crime scenes in the Mattress Sequence. One of the most prominent photos shows two cops kneeling beside what looks like a man sleeping on the ground with his head propped up against a fence. That man is ""The Enforcer"" Frank Nitti, Al Capone\'s right-hand man who had, in fact, committed suicide with a gunshot to the head.', u""In reality, all the actors who played Marlon Brando's sons (Robert Duvall, John Cazale, James Caan, and Al Pacino) were only between six and sixteen years younger than Brando, and Caan's character, Santino, is supposed to be older than Pacino's character, Michael. Caan and Pacino are actually the same age, being born only one month apart in 1940."", u'Mafia crime boss Joe Colombo and his organization, The Italian-American Civil Rights League, started a campaign to stop the film from being made. According to Robert Evans in his autobiography, Colombo called his home and threatened him and his family. Paramount received many letters during pre-production from Italian-Americans, including politicians, decrying the film as anti-Italian. They threatened to protest and disrupt filming. Producer Albert S. Ruddy met with Colombo, who demanded that the terms ""Mafia"" and ""Cosa Nostra"" not be used in the film. Ruddy gave them the right to review the script and make changes. He also agreed to hire League members (read: mobsters) as extras and advisers. The angry letters ceased after this agreement was made. Paramount owner Charlie Bluhdorn read about the agreement in The New York Times and was so outraged that he fired Ruddy and shut down production, but Evans convinced Bluhdorn that the agreement was beneficial for the film, and Ruddy was rehired.', u'According to Francis Ford Coppola in the DVD commentary, in the scene where Captain McCluskey confronts Michael in front of the hospital, the officer who balks at arresting Michael (""He\'s clean, Captain. He\'s a war hero."") is NYPD Detective Sonny Grosso, one of the detectives made famous by his involvement in breaking the ""French Connection"" case.', u'Marlon Brando was only 47 years old when he played Don Vito Corleone.

While preparing for On the Waterfront (1954), Brando became friendly with Lettieri, whose relative was a real-life Mafioso.

He confronted Robert Evans at the premiere and yelled at him, ""Hey, you cut my whole fuckin\' part out"". Caan claimed that forty-five minutes of his character were cut.', u'Martin Sheen and Dean Stockwell auditioned for the role of Michael Corleone. Oscar winner Rod Steiger campaigned hard for the role of Michael, even though he was too old for the part. Warren Beatty, Jack Nicholson, and Dustin Hoffman were all offered the part of Michael Corleone, but all refused. (Beatty was also offered directing and producing duties.) Suggestions of Alain Delon and Burt Reynolds were rejected by Francis Ford Coppola. Paramount production chief Robert Evans wanted Robert Redford to be cast in the part, but Coppola demurred, as he was too WASP-y. Evans explained that Redford could fit the role as he could be perceived as ""northern Italian."" Evans eventually lost the struggle over the actor he derided as ""The Midget."" The Irish-American Ryan O\'Neal then became the front-runner for the part, though it eventually devolved onto James Caan.

Coppola, in a 2003 ""Cigar Aficionado"" interview, said that Paramount pulled some strings and managed to get Pacino released. The Paramount brass, particularly Evans, were adamantly opposed to casting Pacino, who did poorly in screen tests, until they saw his excellent performance in The Panic in Needle Park (1971). Caan went back to his original role of Sonny when Pacino came on board. Robert De Niro tested for both Michael and Sonny and was almost cast as Carlo, before being cast as Paulie.

Ironically, Fontane sings ""I Have But One Heart,"" which was Damone\'s first hit song.', u""Paramount senior management, dissatisfied with the early rushes, considered replacing Francis Ford Coppola with Elia Kazan, with the hope that Kazan would be able to work with the notoriously difficult Marlon Brando.

Evans insisted on Caan because he wanted at least one ""name"" actor to play one of the brothers and because the 6\'4"" Caridi would tower over Pacino on screen.

There is a rumor that Burt Reynolds was originally cast as Sonny Corleone, but Marlon Brando wouldn\'t act with him, considering him more a TV star.', u'When writing the novel, Mario Puzo either directly or indirectly borrowed ideas from real life Mafia stories. Specifically, he borrowed a lot of from the life of New York gangster ""Crazy"" Joe Gallo, including the dynamics of he and his brothers. In the movie, Sonny is the ""hot head"" (Like Crazy Joe), Michael is the thoughtful and intelligent one (Like Larry Gallo), and Fredo is the dimwit (Like Michael Gallo). Also terms like ""Sleeping with the fishes"" and ""Hitting the mattresses"" came from the lives of the Gallos. An associate of the Gallos was killed while on a fishing trip with friends and the Gallos were sent a fish wrapped in a box just as when Sonny gets Luca Brasi\'s bulletproof vest with a fish.

When Paramount considered casting Italian producer Carlo Ponti, director Francis Ford Coppola objected, as Vito had lived in America since childhood and thus wouldn\'t speak with Ponti\'s Italian accent. When asked for his opinion by the Paramount brass, Coppola said he wanted to cast either Laurence Olivier or Marlon Brando as the Don. In a September/October 2003 ""Cigar Aficionado"" magazine cover story, Coppola said, ""I wanted either an Italian-American or an actor who\'s so great that he can portray an Italian-American.

Coppola, however, was adamant in his conviction that Brando take the role instead. This would be the third time Brando performed in a part sought by Sinatra, after playing Terry Malloy in On the Waterfront (1954) and Sky Masterson in Guys and Dolls (1955). Brando\'s previous film, Burn! (1969), had been a terrible flop and he could not get work in American pictures, being considered by many producers as ""washed up."" Paramount executives initially would offer Marlon Brando only union scale for the role of Don Corleone. Finally, the studio relented and paid Brando $300,000, according to Coppola\'s account. In his autobiography The Kid Stays in the Picture (2002), former Paramount production chief Robert Evans claims that Brando was paid $50,000, plus points, and sold back his points to Paramount before the release of the picture for an additional $100,000 because he had female-related money troubles.
