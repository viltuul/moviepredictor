Scorsese had been talking about directing an adaptation since 1980s and entered the first of many written agreements in 1990. At the time, it was to be the next feature Scorsese directed after Kundun (1997).

Following another negotiation, Scorsese agreed to pay various fees after each feature he directed prior to the adaptation including The Departed (2006), Shutter Island (2010) and Hugo (2011). When Scorsese agreed to direct The Wolf of Wall Street (2013) in 2012, Cecchi Gori Pictures filed suit claiming two breaches of written contract, intentional misrepresentation and negligent misrepresentation. The final two charges stemmed from the beliefs that Scorsese and Sikelia Productions falsely represented their plans to make the film in question after ""Hugo,"" which included $1.5 million, plus 20% of all ""back-end"" compensation received by the director, related to ""Hugo."" Scorsese claimed that the lawsuit ""has all the earmarks of a media stunt,"" and for a while it looked like the film was caught in limbo until January 17, 2014 when the sides came to a mutual agreement in a legal settlement.

The chest beating and humming performed by him was improvised and actually a warm-up rite that he performs before acting. When Leonardo DiCaprio saw it while filming, the brief shot of him looking away uneasily from the camera was actually him looking at Martin Scorsese for approval. DiCaprio encouraged them to include it in their scene and later claimed it ""set the tone"" for the rest of the film.', u'The actors snorted crushed B vitamins for scenes that involved cocaine. Jonah Hill claimed that he eventually became sick with bronchitis after so much inhaling and had to be hospitalized.', u'Wanting to work with Martin Scorsese, Jonah Hill took a pay cut by being paid the S.A.G. minimum, which was $60,000.', u""Grossing $392 million worldwide, this is Martin Scorsese's highest grossing film of his career."", u""Martin Scorsese claimed that the sequence of Jordan attempting to get in his car while extremely impaired on Lemmons was improvised on the day of filming, and that it was Leonardo DiCaprio's idea to open the car door with his foot. DiCaprio strained his back during the scene, and was only able to perform the stunt once."", u'The majority of the film was improvised, as Martin Scorsese often encourages.', u'On a routine visit, Steven Spielberg spent a day on the set, watching the shoot of the Steve Madden speech. Martin Scorsese claims that Spielberg essentially codirected the scene, giving advice to actors and suggesting camera angles.', u'Margot Robbie claimed that her sex scene with Leonardo DiCaprio on a bed full of cash was extremely uncomfortable, as the fake paper bills had sharp edges resulting in multiple paper cuts to her back.', u'Originally, Martin Scorsese offered Margot Robbie to appear wearing a bath-robe during the seduction scene between her and Leonardo DiCaprio. Robbie refused and insisted on doing the scene fully nude; her first in her career. According to Robbie: ""The whole point of Naomi is that her body is her only form of currency in this world...She has to be naked. She\'s laying her cards on the table."" Robbie said she had three shots of tequila in succession before shooting the scene to relax. After shooting was complete, Robbie initially fibbed to her family and friends about actually doing the nude scene in order to delay any personal repercussions; claiming C.G.I. was used to superimpose her head on a body-double. She eventually changed her mind and confessed when the film was released.', u'Jordan Belfort coached Leonardo DiCaprio on his behavior, especially instructing him in the various ways he had reacted to the Quaaludes he abused as well as his dope-induced confrontation with Danny Porush.', u'Martin Scorsese has confirmed that some of the editing is odd on purpose, especially the scenes where one or more characters are high, every time Jordan is seen taking drugs the scenes that follow have continuity issues and often flow oddly.', u'During the kissing scene between Leonardo DiCaprio and Joanna Lumley, DiCaprio was so nervous that the scene required a reported twenty-seven takes to get it right.', u""The word 'fuck' and its numerous conjugations are said 569 times, making this the film with the most uses of the word in a main-stream, R-Rated, non-documentary film."", u""Leonardo DiCaprio was paid $25 million for his role, a quarter of the film's budget, making him the highest paid star of the year."", u""During the search for the right Donnie Azoff, Martin Scorsese had requested a meeting with Jonah Hill, but Hill demanded he audition for the part. It was Hill's first audition in six years."", u'Jonah Hill had an audible lisp when he first put in the fake teeth to play Donnie. To get rid of this, he spent over two hours on the phone calling random businesses and talking with them.', u'Martin Scorsese said that there were actual real-life stockbrokers on the set, some of whom actually worked at the real Stratton-Oakmont firm.', u""Leonardo DiCaprio was obsessed with playing Jordan Belfort since getting hold of the book back in 2007, DiCaprio has been focused on turning the depraved tale of Jordan Belfort into a film. However, he wasn't just interested in this story's connection to the most recent collapse on Wall Street, he was also attracted to Jordan's honest and uncompromising portrayal of what he actually experienced."", u'Martin Scorsese needed a pick-up shot of the ""fasten your seat belt"" blinking sign for the airplane scene but didn\'t want to waste time and money on setting up a gimbal. Robert Legato, the effects supervisor, took a reference video of one during a flight with his iPhone to show Scorsese. Upon seeing the footage, Scorsese said ""Great. Let\'s just use that."" Thus, the film became Scorsese\'s first to incorporate footage taken from an iPhone.', u'This movie was banned in 5 countries due to high sexual content.', u'In one of Jordan Belfort\'s speeches he mentioned the phrase ""there is no nobility in poverty"". He was quoting Charlie Sheen from the movie Wall Street (1987)', u""The real Jordan Belfort supported the film's depiction of excess as true to life, though he pointed out that the film leaves the impression that Stratton Oakmont never did any serious work. Belfort argued that they could not have gotten away with their corrupt practices for so long unless they had been delivering on legitimate business most of the time."", u""The real Mark Hanna, who was portrayed by Matthew McConaughey, stated he bought 25% of Jordan Belfort's business and worked with him for two more years. This was not depicted in the film."", u'Leonardo DiCaprio says that he and Martin Scorsese were able to \'push the envelope\' with their depiction of over-the-top sexual acts and scenes in ""Wolf"" and \'make the movie they wanted to\' primarily because the production was financed independently, and not by any major studio. Scorsese did, however, edit some sexual content and nudity to avoid an NC-17 rating at the request of the MPAA.', u'The real Jordon Belfort makes a cameo appearance in the final scene. He is the one who introduces Jordan Belfort (Leonardo Dicaprio) at the motivational speaking event.', u""In an interview with Margot Robbie, she reveals that for the scene where Jordan and Naomi have sex for the first time in her apartment and her dog tries to jump up and bite him that they had trouble getting the dog to jump, so they had to put dog food and chicken livers all over Leonardo DiCaprio's feet and between his toes."", u'This film broke the Guinness World Record for the most swearing in one movie: 681 expletives (equal to 3.81 swears per minute).', u'The scene when Leonardo Di Caprio and Matthew McConaughey are having lunch is supposed to take place in a World Trade Center building.', u""Leonardo DiCaprio's dance scene was done on the spot, but he learned it by himself over decades."", u'Footage of the actual 1991 Hamptons beach party is shown in the film, with Jordan Belfort and then-fianc\xe9e Nadine Caridi (""Naomi Belfort"") can be found on YouTube.', u""In order to show Jordan's state of mind, director of photography Rodrigo Prieto constantly switched lens types. For scenes where Jordan is in a clear mental state, flat spherical lenses are used, while in sections where he does not, anamorphic lenses are used. Longer focal lenses are used from the stage where Jordan is being pursued by Denham and his team to reflect Belfort's unraveling and the sense of being spied upon."", u""The initial cut of the film ran approximately four hours. Paramount originally intended to release the four hour director's cut in DVD and Blu-ray but changed its mind and stayed with the three hour theatrical release version."", u'Leonardo DiCaprio cited Caligula (1979) as an inspiration for the way he wanted the excess and decadence depicted in the film.', u'Leonardo DiCaprio explained to Ellen DeGeneres that during the Quaalude sequence it took them seventy takes just to get the ham to stick to his face. This was achieved by flicking the ham off of a spoon and using K Y jelly in order to make it sticky enough.', u'The real Jordan Belfort says the model for his get-rich-quick, and by-any-means, ruthlessly unscrupulous disposition was Gordon Gekko in Wall Street (1987).', u""This cast assembled by director Martin Scorsese's film includes three other prominent directors in acting roles: Rob Reiner, Spike Jonze, and Jon Favreau."", u""The role of Steve Madden was played by Jake Hoffman, Dustin Hoffman's son."", u'For the deposition scenes, the actors were merely instructed by Martin Scorsese to avoid saying anything important, or anything at all.

The rising card is one of these pieces. It was created and performed on stage by Howard Thurston in the early 1900's.

When Scorsese agreed to direct The Wolf of Wall Street (2013) in 2012, Cecchi Gori Pictures filed suit claiming two breaches of written contract, intentional misrepresentation and negligent misrepresentation.

After appearing in the first version of the pilot, Dratch was replaced by Jane Krakowski and given bit parts during the first season.', u'In 2012 Tina Fey explained the Emmy in Liz Lemon\'s office: ""I\'ve always sort of thought that it\'s a Daytime Emmy and that perhaps she got it for writing a really specific category, like Best Regional Promo for the show The Mommies (1993) or something like that . . . [Or] for writing jokes for Joy Behar for The View (2001)--it\'s definitely a Daytime Emmy. It\'s a local Daytime Emmy.""', u'Lee, the costume designer for ""TGS"", is played by Tom Broecker, who in real life is the costume designer for ""30 Rock.""', u'Liz Lemon\'s office has a framed cover of ""Bust"" magazine with Amy Poehler reenacting Janet Leigh\'s shower scene in Psycho (1960). Tina Fey and Poehler are close friends and former cast members on Saturday Night Live (1975).', u'On December 29, 2006, Nielsen Media Research reported the results of having, for the first time, monitored viewers who use a digital video recorder to record shows for later viewing. According to the Nielsen numbers, ""30 Rock"" had the fifth-largest increase (viewers who use a DVR to record the show and then watch it within a week of its initial airing). According to Nielsen, the show adds nearly 7.5% to its total audience every week as a result of these ""live plus seven"" viewers', u'Tina Fey originally pitched a series about a cable news producer who is forced to produce a show hosted by a right-wing pundit. Rachel Dratch and Alec Baldwin, respectively, would have played the roles, but NBC suggested a show based on her Saturday Night Live (1975) experiences instead.', u""Jenna's name is a play on Janel Moloney (who later guest-starred in the series)."", u'Jane Krakowski and Cheyenne Jackson both originated the lead roles in the workshop of ""Xanadu"" for Broadway. Krakowski left the show before it premiered to star in ""30 Rock"" instead. Jackson decided to leave the show because he did not want to perform without her. He ended up returning when the replacement actor broke his ankle only a short while before the show opened. Both have since appeared on ""30 Rock"" together, where their close real-life friendship is reversed, with Jenna resenting Jackson\'s character and he being disgusted by her constant rude behavior.', u'Tracy Morgan (""Tracy Jordan"") and recurring player Rachel Dratch followed creator/star Tina Fey from Saturday Night Live (1975) to create this show. In addition, star Alec Baldwin holds the record for the most times to host ""SNL"" (as of February 2017, having hosted it for 17 times).', u""Season 2 was shorter than Season 1 (15 episodes as opposed to S1's 21) because of the 2007-2008 Writers Guild of America strike."", u""The professional and personal relationship between Liz Lemon and Jack Donaghy is based in part on Tina Fey's real-life friendship with executive producer Lorne Michaels."", u""Tina Fey didn't want Liz Lemon to be a single mother because it would have restricted her character. This allowed Liz more freedom, and gave Fey more avenues to explore."", u""The awning in front of Liz Lemon's apartment has displayed two different addresses over the course of the show. In some episodes the address is 160 Riverside Drive and in other shows the address is 168 Riverside Drive. The former is the real address of the exterior building shown and it is directly across the street from the exterior building used on Will & Grace. In an audio commentary Tina Fey jokes that they should've shown Eric McCormick (star of Will & Grace) walking out of that building."", u'Characters Liz and Jenna began ""The Girlie Show"" at The Second City in Chicago. In 1992 Tina Fey took classes there and in 1994 was invited to join the cast. Her writing partner was Rachel Dratch and their time together inspired the relationship between Liz and Jenna.', u'The same year that ""30 Rock"" started airing, Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip (2006), another show set behind the scenes of a fictional Saturday Night Live (1975)-type show, also premiered. Even though there were many differences between them (including ""30 Rock"" being a half-hour sitcom while ""Studio 60"" was an hour-long drama), many critics compared the two shows and engaged in speculation about which one would survive. ""Studio 60"" was canceled after one season, and creator Aaron Sorkin and former regular Nate Corddry both went on to guest-star on ""30 Rock.""', u'In an unusual move for a modern sitcom, the show is shot on (more expensive) film stock rather than in digital.', u'The show was finally syndicated in 2009, something Tina Fey had always complained about.', u'Aside from the main cast and the supporting actors credited at the beginning of each episode (Tracy\'s entourage and ""TGS"" employees), the only actors who appeared in every season are Elaine Stritch, Will Arnett, Chris Parnell and Dean Winters.', u'Season 3 saw an influx of special guest appearances, including Steve Martin, Jennifer Aniston, Oprah Winfrey, Megan Mullally, Jon Hamm, Salma Hayek and Alan Alda.', u""In several episodes in season 4 there is a picture of Kristen Wiig on Jack Donaghy's window sill behind his desk."", u'Andrea Martin was offered the role of Margaret Lemon but her commitments to the Broadway musical adaptation of Young Frankenstein (1974) prevented her from appearing. Martin later guest starred as Bonnie Badamath.', u""All the 'alcohol' that Jack is seen drinking is actually ice tea."", u'Don Geiss and his son Bertram (played by real life father and son, Rip Torn and Tony Torn, respectively) never shared a scene together.', u'Jack Donaghy is a staunch conservative Republican who looks down on anything he considers even remotely liberal. In real life, Alec Baldwin is a staunch Democrat famous for his liberal political views.', u'Before Will Forte played Paul, Jenna\'s boyfriend and Jenna impersonator in later episodes, he appeared in Season 1 Episode 12 ""Black Tie"" as ""Tomas"" the assistant to Austrian Prince Gerhardt, played by Paul Reubens. In the episode, he tells Jenna that the Prince wishes to meet her and introduces them.', u'In an episode of Season one, Jack (Alec Baldwin) mentions watching ""Friends"" (1994) and makes several references to the show. Baldwin made an appearance in Friends as Parker, the overly enthusiastic guy Phoebe goes out with in Season 8. Also, David Schwimmer and Jennifer Aniston (Ross and Rachel in Friends) both guest starred in 30 Rock during Seasons 2 and 3 (Schwimmer in Season 2 and Aniston in Season 3 respectively).', u'Liz says the first line of the series and Kenneth says the last line.', u'Jason Sudeikis and James Marsden share the same birthday (September 18) and both played love interests of Liz Lemon.', u'In 30 Rock: The Ones (2009) Kenneth states his real name shortly before suffering an allergic shock being Dick Whitman. Dick Whitman is also the real name of Don Draper, one of the Main Characters of ""Mad Men (2007)"" which Jon Hamm (one of Liz\'s love interests) starred in.', u'The title is derived from 30 Rockefeller Plaza, the New York City street address of NBC Universal.', u""Other than the obvious (Tina, Tracy, Jason Sudeikis, Rachel Dratch) many SNL alumni were in 30 Rock over the years. To name a few: The late Jan Hooks as Jenna's mother, Verna Maloney, Will Ferrell (I)' as Shane Hunter, Fred Armisen as Frank 2.0, Bill Hader as Kevin in an episode in 2010, Julia Louis-Dreyfus as Liz in Episode 1 2010, Rob Riggle as Reggie 2011, Bobby Moynihan as Stewart Derr, Siobhan Fallon Hogan as Patricia 2007, Andy Samberg as himself 2012, Kristen Wiig as Candice Van Der Shark 2007, Amy Poehler as young Liz 2012, Don Pardo and Sid 2009, Horatio Sanz' as Maynard 2010, Molly Shannon as Katherine Catherine 2007, Jon Glaser (did, I THINK one SNL skit) as Mike, and Lorne Michaels as Reverend Gimp."", u""Hazel's real name is Richard Drench."", u'The show\'s name is similar to ""3rd Rock,"" the commonly used short title for 3rd Rock from the Sun (1996). At The 64th Annual Golden Globe Awards (2007), Tim Allen mispronounced the show\'s name as ""3rd Rock"" when mentioning that Alec Baldwin had been nominated for the Best Actor in a Television Comedy or Musical Award. Both shows featured guest appearances by Elaine Stritch as the mother of one of the main characters.', u'Tina Fey and Scott Adsit both did voice work for the pinball game Medieval Madness.', u'Donald Glover, who was a staff writer for 30 Rock from 2008-2009, also appeared on camera in several fleeting appearances during that period (for instance, as Young P.A in ""Jack-Tor"" or as Gay Kid in ""Kidney Now!""). After he left the staff of 30 Rock for a role on Community (which made him a star), he returned to play Young Tracy Jordan in the 2012 live episode. During an April 2012 interview with Entertainment Weekly, Tina Fey said that they already knew that Glover ""could sound like Tracy, because we did an extended version of [Tracy Jordan\'s novelty song] \'Werewolf Bar Mitzvah,\' and by the time we finished it, we were wrapped and didn\'t have Tracy. So half of it is just Donald imitating Tracy.""', u'A running gag is the mispronunciation of the film ""Rural Juror"", which Jenna starred in series 1. It is often just pronounced as ""Rrurr Jjurr"". In the season 7 finale, Jenna sings the theme song of the musical ""Rural Juror"". The song itself has utterly incomprehensible lyrics for the public. However, it is the first time Jenna pronounces ""Rural Juror"" correctly. One of the lyrics that was pronounced perfectly was ""I----- will never forget you, rural juror."" The sentiment can be interpreted as Jenna/Jane/the writers of 30 Rock expressing their sadness over the show\'s end.', u""Rachel Dratch's appearance as various characters throughout the show is a fourth-wall-busting display of improv, a topic in many of the episodes."", u'Will Forte, Mary Steenbergen, and Kristen Schaal all guest starred on 30 Rock before going on to star in The Last Man on Earth (2015-)', u'Tina Fey (Liz Lemon), Jack McBrayer (Kenneth Parcell), and Scott Adsit (Pete Hornberger) have all provided their voices for work in Disney films. Fey in Monkey Kingdom (2015), McBrayer starred as Fix It Felix in Wreck It Ralph (2012), and Adsit as Baymax in Big Hero 6 (2014).', u'Over the course of the series, there were many hints that Kenneth was considerably older than the character\'s outward appearance would suggest (the actor who plays Kenneth, Jack McBrayer, was in his early 30s when ""30 Rock"" started). These include: Kenneth\'s recognition of TV pop culture from decades before he logically would have been born; he\'s familiar with the laws of the Roman Republic and fluent in Latin; his anxiety in ""Don Geiss, America and Hope"" that NBC will start limiting and verifying the ages of their pages and his concern in ""The Problem Solvers"" that people in the office have been spreading a rumor that he\'s ""been alive forever""; his memory that an eight-year-old \'Shirley Temple (I)\' taught him how to roll cigarettes; his refusal to tell Suze Orman his age in ""Today You Are a Man""; his on-screen identification as ""Kenneth Parcell: Elderly Page"" in ""Queen of Jordan""; and many other jokes and references. In the episode ""Governor Dunston,"" Kenneth\'s mother (Catherine O\'Hara) visits and tells Jenna that Kenneth has ""always been a special boy. I remember the day he was born. He looked up at me and said, \'Momma, I am not a person. My body\'s just a flesh vessel for an immortal being whose name if you heard it would make you lose your mind.\'"" In the last episode of the series, Kenneth looks to be exactly the same even many decades in the future, still the president of NBC, hearing a series pitch from Liz\'s great-granddaughter; many viewers speculated that that meant that Kenneth is actually immortal.', u'Kenneth said in an episode that when he first started at NBC, an 8 year old Shirley Temple taught him how to roll a cigarette. Shirley Temple was born in 1928 which means Kenneth started at NBC in 1936.', u""The show often pokes fun at themes and characters that the show leaves hanging. For example, in one episode, Kenneth tells Liz that no more mail could fit into her box because it was stuffed with unopened adoption letters, hinting at Liz's disappeared interest to adopt a child. Another instance is the character of Danny Baker. In one episode, Pete tells Danny that he would've asked Danny to do a favor for him, but he forgot he works at TGS, poking fun at the fact that Danny often goes missing for several episodes at a time. Again, in the 100th episode, Danny states that he remembers season 1 of TGS, even though he hadn't worked there yet, but then later in the episode has Josh's flashbacks, meaning that Danny and Josh share the same fate in which they both appear in several episodes and then are never heard from again."", u'Elizabeth Banks played a character on Scrubs (2001) who was impregnated by a character named J.D.

Both movies were first screened at Cannes, and a huge buzz was created about them. After they were screened, they both received bad reviews (Southland Tales (2006) scored the lowest reviews for the 2006 Cannes Film Festival, averaging 1.1 out of 5) and bad audience reaction.

The film\'s voice coach, Tim Monich, resisted using a generic Irish brogue and instead focused on distinctive dialects of Ireland and Great Britain. As Leonardo DiCaprio\'s character was born in Ireland but raised in the United States, his accent was designed to be a blend of accents typical of the half-Americanized. To develop the unique, lost accents of the Yankee ""Nativists"" such as Daniel Day-Lewis\' character, Monich studied old poems, ballads, newspaper articles (which sometimes imitated spoken dialect as a form of humor) and the Rogue\'s Lexicon, a book of underworld idioms compiled by New York\'s police commissioner, so that his men would be able to tell what criminals were talking about. An important piece was an 1892 wax cylinder recording of Walt Whitman reciting four lines of a poem in which he pronounced the word ""world"" as ""woild"", and the ""a"" of ""an"" nasal and flat, like ""ayan"".

Although Catalan did not make the final cut of the show, his lawyer was finally able to find him and his daughter in the outtakes, and determined from the timestamps on the tapes that Catalan could not have been the killer.

DeNiro at one point, would eat a dinner heavy in pasta and drink it down with a vanilla milkshake before going to bed. It was De Niro's idea to do it this way. These scenes were generally shot with the minimum of takes as De Niro would become exhausted much more quickly."", u""Thelma Schoonmaker's husband, director Michael Powell, was consulted about the weight gain scenes. In Powell's The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp (1943), the lead character gets significantly bigger during the course of the movie. Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro were curious how the actor Roger Livesey had achieved that effect. Powell informed them that Livesay had gotten bigger through careful use of camera angles, shaving his hair to make his head appear larger and judicious use of padding. Scorsese and De Niro felt that the film was too realistic to get away with that kind of effect so the decision was made for De Niro to physically bulk up through overeating."", u'When Paul Schrader was working on the script, he put in numerous shocking moments such as Jake LaMotta masturbating and dipping his penis into a bucket of ice. Schrader later admitted that the film held less personal significance to him than it did for Robert De Niro and Martin Scorsese and he added the shocking material just to see what he could get past the studio. Ultimately, the masturbation was cut and, instead of putting his penis into the ice, La Motta pours the ice down his underwear.', u'This differs radically from other boxing movies like Rocky (1976) and Body and Soul (1981) in that the camera was inside the ring for the fight scenes, not outside the ropes.', u""Jake LaMotta's brother Joseph LaMotta sued the production for US $2.5 million for the film's alleged unflattering depiction of him."", u""Martin Scorsese was at one stage so startled by Robert De Niro's weight gain that he shut down production, fearing for the actor's health."", u'Ranked #1 on the American Film Institute\'s list of the 10 greatest films in the genre ""Sports"" in June 2008.', u'According to Martin Scorsese, the script took only two weeks to write on the island of St Martin in the Caribbean.', u'The original script was vetoed by producer Steven Bach after he told Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro that Jake LaMotta was ""a cockroach"".

Michael Powell, who at that time had become something of a mentor and good friend to Scorsese, suggested that it was the color of the gloves that was throwing them off. Realizing this was true, Scorsese then decided the movie had to be filmed in black and white.', u""Mardik Martin wrote the most traditional, linear script for the film (more of a traditional Jake LaMotta biography), but backed off on the project due to exhaustion after months of research. Paul Schrader made several changes to the script, including making, Joey La Motta, Jake's brother, the second most prominent character (by combining his actions with that of Jake's friend, Peter Savage) and starting the story in the middle of La Motta's career rather than at the beginning. Although they kept Schrader's overall structure, Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro spent 5 weeks rewriting his version of the script until they had exactly the film they wanted (Scorsese and De Niro are uncredited as screenwriters for the film)."", u'Meeting resistance from United Artists about making a boxing film with a dark anti-hero, producers Irwin Winkler and Robert Chartoff refused to tolerate making Rocky II (1979) until Raging Bull (1980) was approved.', u""Jodie Foster didn't audition for Raging Bull. Producers didn't find her suitable for the character of Vickie and considered her as too young and tomboyish. Despite that she still wanted to get the role. Most likely because of her admiration for Robert De Niro and Martin Scorsese's work. Her mom thought about a way to convince the producers that Jodie was no longer the girl from Freaky Friday (1976) or Taxi Driver (1976) anymore but a young woman. The result was a session with photographer Emilio Lari at a rented estate in Los Angeles in the Summer of 1978 when Jodie Foster was fifteen years old.

For scenes where Jake retires to his corner between rounds, Chapman gradually overcranked his camera by 'ear' from 24fps up to 48fps as Jake walked away (simultaneously adjusting the diaphragm to maintain exposure consistency), and then reversed procedure as Jake emerged from his corner to resume fighting - all in one shot.

Unhappy with the result, the producers hired Paul Schrader to restructure it, and in the course of doing research on La Motta, the writer came across an article on the relationship between Jake and his brother Joey LaMotta. Schrader incorporated the relationship into the revised screenplay, co-opting the Savage character and creating a composite of the two men in the person of Joey La Motta.

Another reason was the feeling of reality, because at the particular time represented by the home movies, 8mm color home movie cameras were very popular.', u'Martin Scorsese claims that nothing should be read into his using the On the Waterfront (1954) quote. Jake LaMotta, in his declining years, used to appear on stage reciting dialogue from television plays and even reading William Shakespeare. According to Scorsese, he\'d planned to use something from ""Richard III"" (because in the corresponding real-life event LaMotta used it), but director Michael Powell suggested that ""Richard III"" wouldn\'t work in the context of the film because the film in general and LaMotta in particular are inherently American.

He was fired from the AFI, basically friendless, in the midst of a divorce and was rejected by a girlfriend. Squatting in his ex-girlfriend's apartment while she was away for a couple of months, Schrader literally didn't talk to anyone for many weeks, went to porno theaters and developed an obsession with guns. Schrader was working at the time as delivery man for a chain of chicken restaurants. Spending long days alone in his car, he felt--I might as well be a taxi driver. He also shared with Bickle the sense of isolation from being a mid-Westerner in an urban center. Schrader decided to switch the action to New York City only because taxi drivers are far more common there. Schrader's script clicked with both Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro when they read it."", u'Robert De Niro has said that, despite having won an Oscar for The Godfather: Part II (1974), he was still a relatively unfamiliar face and was only actually recognized once while driving a New York cab during his research for this film.', u'The producers were looking for a ""Cybill Shepherd"" type to play the female lead in the film.

Hermann only accepted after reading the script, and then wrote a highly original score using dissonant brass to punctuate the inner emotions of Travis. After the initial scoring sessions, Scorsese called his composer again, insisting that he needed one more musical cue--a sting, a single frightening chord. Hermann called back a studio orchestra who were paid a day\'s work for that one effect. Shortly after that ultimate session, Hermann died at the age of 64. He had begun his film career in Hollywood writing the music for Citizen Kane (1941).', u'Producer Julia Phillips tells in her auto-biography that Cybill Shepherd had a hard time remembering her lines during the coffee-and-pie scene with Robert De Niro.

Phillips further revealed that Scorsese and Shepard had a difficult relationship on set, with the director having to feed the actress line readings to achieve a credible performance.', u'Travis Bickle\'s famous ""You talkin\' to me?"" scene may have been inspired by Robert De Niro\'s training under Stella Adler, who (as an exercise) had her students practice different interpretations of a similar phrase. The legendary acting teacher was surprised to see one of her former students use ""You talkin\' to me?"" as a psychotic mantra. Martin Scorsese was encouraging De Niro just below the camera while shooting the scene, which led to the rest of the ""dialogue"" Bickle has with his mirror.', u'The clash between Martin Scorsese, the MPAA and the executives at Columbia over the violent content of this film has gone into legend. One of the biggest rumors is that, when facing an X rating from the MPAA and having to edit the film, Scorsese stayed up all night drinking with a loaded gun in his hand, preparing to shoot the executive at Columbia the next day. After an entire night of persuasion from his friends, Scorsese decided to mute the colors in the violent climax and subsequently got his R rating. There are many variations on this legend, one saying that Scorsese was actually planning to take his OWN life; another says that he actually brought the gun to Columbia and threatened the executive until the executive relented.', u'Paul Schrader was inspired to write the script after reading the published diary of Arthur Bremer, the man who was convicted of shooting presidential hopeful George Wallace.

One of the ideas he had was, in the words of biographer Shawn Levy, ""about a lonely man wandering New York City with guns and dreaming of an assassination.""

Martin Scorsese wanted a smooth jazz cue to underscore a scene with Iris and her pimp Sport. Jazz was not Herrmann\'s forte, so he asked his friend Christopher Palmer to arrange something from his existing material. Palmer took the first four bars of the song ""As the Wind Bloweth"" from Hermann\'s 1970 musical ""The King of Schnorrers"", expanded the melodic line with a jazzy twist, and gave the piece a new title.

His daughter Dorothy recalled, ""I knew he was dying...He was just a shadow of his former self, and it was remarkable that he could have written \'Taxi Driver\' under the circumstances.

Makeup artist Dick Smith created a bald cap that was glued to De Niro's head and the mohawk was made of thick horse hair. That hairpiece is currently at the Museum of Moving Images in Astoria, New York."", u'Many critics and fans have speculated that Travis Bickle actually dies during the climatic shootout, and the scenes where he recovers, is thanked by Iris\' parents via letter, and talks to Betsy when she happens to ride in his taxi by chance, are either his dying delusions or pure fantasy. Martin Scorsese and Paul Schrader both provided commentary on laserdisc/DVD releases of the film that deny this theory. Scorsese said that the cab ride with Travis and Betsy is a real event, with Travis\'s ambiguous look after she leaves the cab indicating uncertainty over his own thoughts. Schrader\'s comments were that Travis ""is not cured"" after surviving the shootout, and the writer added ""next time, he\'s not going to be a hero"".', u""Director Martin Scorsese's parents (Charles Scorsese and Catherine Scorsese) appear as Iris' parents in the newspaper article hanging on Travis' wall at the end of the movie."", u'Washington Post film critic Stephen Hunter speculated that Travis Bickle\'s character wasn\'t a Vietnam War veteran at all, and his behavior could indicate a man so disturbed that he chose a war veteran ""look"" as a way to somehow connect to the post-war society. However, Martin Scorsese has confirmed in interviews that Bickle was definitely a Vietnam veteran: he said that Bickle\'s mental instability tied into the nation\'s feelings after the war ended in 1975, and also that the Mohawk haircut Travis gets before the climatic violent rampage was inspired by soldiers in Vietnam who would have their hair styled that way before major battles.', u'Due to the bloody content of the brothel shootout scene, cinematographer Michael Chapman agreed to desaturate the colors in post-production. This explains why the blood appears to be pink instead of red in that scene. Later, when the DVD was being prepared, Martin Scorsese wanted to replace it with the original shot, with the blood in its original vivid redness, but no print of that original scene could be found, so the DVD still has the muted colors.', u""Despite being criticized for its violence, only four characters die: the armed robber in the corner shop that Travis shoots, the pimp, the Mafioso and the doorman. Some people believe that Travis actually dies in the shootout (and that the final sequences of the movie are a wish-fulfillment in Travis' head) so that would raise the body count to five."", u'When Bickle decides to assassinate Senator Palantine, he cuts his hair into a Mohawk. This detail was suggested by actor Victor Magnotta, a friend of Martin Scorsese\'s who had a small role as a Secret Service agent and who had served in Vietnam. Scorsese later noted, ""Magnotta had talked about certain types of soldiers going into the jungle. They cut their hair in a certain way; looked like a Mohawk ... and you knew that was a special situation, a commando kind of situation, and people gave them wide berths ... we thought it was a good idea.""', u""In this film, Jodie Foster plays a woman held captive by the villain, played by Harvey Keitel. Robert De Niro's actions in this film provoked John Hinckley, who was obsessed with Foster, to try to get her attention by shooting President Ronald Reagan. The opportunity to reverse her role in this film, and also distance herself from Hinkley, is in part what inspired Foster to take the role of the heroine and rescuer in The Silence of the Lambs (1991). Harvey Keitel would play her future mentor in the prequel, Punainen lohik\xe4\xe4rme (2002)."", u'Taking place in an actual apartment, the tracking shot over the murder scene at the end took three months of preparation just because the production team had to cut through the ceiling in order to get it right.', u""Bickle's attempted assassination of Senator Charles Palantine inspired John Hinckley's attempted assassination of US President Ronald Reagan on March 30, 1981. Prior to the crime, Hinckley had been stalking Jodie Foster at Yale Iniversity, due to his obsession with her character Iris in Taxi Driver (1976). In a letter wrote to Foster, he told her that he was going to assassinate the President, so he could impress her. Reagan was shot in the chest and wounded by Hinckley, Jr., who was committed to a psychiatric facility when he was found not guilty by reason of insanity in 1982. He was released on September 10, 2016 after 34 years in confinement."", u'On the Laserdisc audio commentary, Martin Scorsese acknowledged several critics\' interpretation of the film\'s ending as being Bickle\'s dying dream. He admits that the last scene of Bickle glancing at an unseen object implies that Bickle might fall into rage and recklessness in the future, and he is like ""a ticking time bomb."" Paul Schrader confirms this in his commentary on the 30th-anniversary DVD, stating that Travis ""is not cured by the movie\'s end"", and that ""he\'s not going to be a hero next time."" When asked on the website Reddit about the film\'s ending, Schrader said that it was not to be taken as a dream sequence, but that he envisioned it as returning to the beginning of the film-as if the last frame ""could be spliced to the first frame, and the movie started all over again.""', u'Body count: 4.', u'According to James Wan on the special features of Death Sentence (2007), the ending to that film was inspired by the shoot-out of Taxi Driver (1976).']","[u'USA::7 February 1976 (New York City, New York)', u'USA::8 February 1976', u'USA::25 February 1976 (Los Angeles, California)', u'Brazil::22 March 1976', u'France::20 May 1976 (Cannes Film Festival)', u'France::2 June 1976', u'Australia::10 June 1976', u'Netherlands::1 July 1976', u'Belgium::5 August 1976 (Gent)', u'Denmark::16 August 1976', u'UK::19 August 1976', u'Ireland::10 September 1976', u'Uruguay::16 September 1976', u'Japan::18 September 1976', u'Italy::24 September 1976', u'Austria::7 October 1976', u'West Germany::7 October 1976', u'Argentina::28 October 1976', u'Finland::12 November 1976', u'Norway::26 December 1976', u'Spain::10 March 1977', u'Greece::12 March 1977', u'Sweden::12 March 1977', u'Portugal::15 April 1977', u'Hong Kong::12 May 1977', u'Turkey::1 December 1977', u'Poland::3 March 1978', u'Italy::7 May 1981 (re-release)', u'Hungary::8 May 1988', u'South Korea::17 February 1989', u'USA::16 February 1996 (re-release)', u'Australia::4 April 1996 (re-release)', u'France::October 1997 (Montpellier Mediterranean Film Festival)', u'Denmark::23 July 1999 (re-release)', u'Greece::28 July 2000 (re-release)', u'France::10 January 2001 (limited) (re-release)', u'USA::13 December 2002 (Moonlit Matines Film Festival)', u'Sweden::30 January 2004 (re-release)', u'Germany::February 2004 (Berlin International Film Festival)', u'France::10 November 2004 (re-release)', u'Iceland::12 April 2005 (Iceland International Film Festival)', u'UK::14 July 2006 (re-release)', u'France::September 2007 (Deauville Film Festival)', u'South Korea::10 October 2009 (Pusan International Film Festival)', u'USA::19 March 2011 (restored version) (limited)', u'UK::13 May 2011 (re-release)', u'Greece::5 July 2012 (re-release)', u'Portugal::4 April 2013 (re-release) (restored version)', u'France::1 May 2013 (re-release)', u'Argentina::30 October 2014 (re-release)', u'Chile::1 November 2014 (re-release)', u'France::4 November 2015 (re-release) (restored version)', u'USA::21 April 2016 (Tribeca Film Festival)', u'Australia::11 June 2016 (Sydney Film Festival)', u'Chile::24 August 2016 (SANFIC Film Festival)', u'Japan::17 September 2016 (Gokujo Onkyo Film Festival)', u'Portugal::22 September 2016 (re-release) (restored version)', u'France::9 November 2016 (re-release) (restored version)', u'UK::10 February 2017 (re-release)', u'Ireland::10 February 2017 (re-release)', u'Netherlands::6 July 2017 (re-release)']",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The chest beating and humming performed by him was improvised and actually a warm-up rite that he performs before acting. When Leonardo DiCaprio saw it while filming, the brief shot of him looking away uneasily from the camera was actually him looking at Martin Scorsese for approval. DiCaprio encouraged them to include it in their scene and later claimed it ""set the tone"" for the rest of the film.', u'The actors snorted crushed B vitamins for scenes that involved cocaine. Jonah Hill claimed that he eventually became sick with bronchitis after so much inhaling and had to be hospitalized.', u'Wanting to work with Martin Scorsese, Jonah Hill took a pay cut by being paid the S.A.G. minimum, which was $60,000.', u""Grossing $392 million worldwide, this is Martin Scorsese's highest grossing film of his career."", u""Martin Scorsese claimed that the sequence of Jordan attempting to get in his car while extremely impaired on Lemmons was improvised on the day of filming, and that it was Leonardo DiCaprio's idea to open the car door with his foot. DiCaprio strained his back during the scene, and was only able to perform the stunt once."", u'The majority of the film was improvised, as Martin Scorsese often encourages.', u'On a routine visit, Steven Spielberg spent a day on the set, watching the shoot of the Steve Madden speech. Martin Scorsese claims that Spielberg essentially codirected the scene, giving advice to actors and suggesting camera angles.', u'Margot Robbie claimed that her sex scene with Leonardo DiCaprio on a bed full of cash was extremely uncomfortable, as the fake paper bills had sharp edges resulting in multiple paper cuts to her back.', u'Originally, Martin Scorsese offered Margot Robbie to appear wearing a bath-robe during the seduction scene between her and Leonardo DiCaprio. Robbie refused and insisted on doing the scene fully nude; her first in her career. According to Robbie: ""The whole point of Naomi is that her body is her only form of currency in this world...She has to be naked. She\'s laying her cards on the table."" Robbie said she had three shots of tequila in succession before shooting the scene to relax. After shooting was complete, Robbie initially fibbed to her family and friends about actually doing the nude scene in order to delay any personal repercussions; claiming C.G.I. was used to superimpose her head on a body-double. She eventually changed her mind and confessed when the film was released.', u'Jordan Belfort coached Leonardo DiCaprio on his behavior, especially instructing him in the various ways he had reacted to the Quaaludes he abused as well as his dope-induced confrontation with Danny Porush.', u'Martin Scorsese has confirmed that some of the editing is odd on purpose, especially the scenes where one or more characters are high, every time Jordan is seen taking drugs the scenes that follow have continuity issues and often flow oddly.', u'During the kissing scene between Leonardo DiCaprio and Joanna Lumley, DiCaprio was so nervous that the scene required a reported twenty-seven takes to get it right.', u""The word 'fuck' and its numerous conjugations are said 569 times, making this the film with the most uses of the word in a main-stream, R-Rated, non-documentary film."", u""Leonardo DiCaprio was paid $25 million for his role, a quarter of the film's budget, making him the highest paid star of the year."", u""During the search for the right Donnie Azoff, Martin Scorsese had requested a meeting with Jonah Hill, but Hill demanded he audition for the part. It was Hill's first audition in six years."", u'Jonah Hill had an audible lisp when he first put in the fake teeth to play Donnie. To get rid of this, he spent over two hours on the phone calling random businesses and talking with them.', u'Martin Scorsese said that there were actual real-life stockbrokers on the set, some of whom actually worked at the real Stratton-Oakmont firm.', u""Leonardo DiCaprio was obsessed with playing Jordan Belfort since getting hold of the book back in 2007, DiCaprio has been focused on turning the depraved tale of Jordan Belfort into a film. However, he wasn't just interested in this story's connection to the most recent collapse on Wall Street, he was also attracted to Jordan's honest and uncompromising portrayal of what he actually experienced."", u'Martin Scorsese needed a pick-up shot of the ""fasten your seat belt"" blinking sign for the airplane scene but didn\'t want to waste time and money on setting up a gimbal. Robert Legato, the effects supervisor, took a reference video of one during a flight with his iPhone to show Scorsese. Upon seeing the footage, Scorsese said ""Great. Let\'s just use that."" Thus, the film became Scorsese\'s first to incorporate footage taken from an iPhone.', u'This movie was banned in 5 countries due to high sexual content.', u'In one of Jordan Belfort\'s speeches he mentioned the phrase ""there is no nobility in poverty"". He was quoting Charlie Sheen from the movie Wall Street (1987)', u""The real Jordan Belfort supported the film's depiction of excess as true to life, though he pointed out that the film leaves the impression that Stratton Oakmont never did any serious work. Belfort argued that they could not have gotten away with their corrupt practices for so long unless they had been delivering on legitimate business most of the time."", u""The real Mark Hanna, who was portrayed by Matthew McConaughey, stated he bought 25% of Jordan Belfort's business and worked with him for two more years. This was not depicted in the film."", u'Leonardo DiCaprio says that he and Martin Scorsese were able to \'push the envelope\' with their depiction of over-the-top sexual acts and scenes in ""Wolf"" and \'make the movie they wanted to\' primarily because the production was financed independently, and not by any major studio. Scorsese did, however, edit some sexual content and nudity to avoid an NC-17 rating at the request of the MPAA.', u'The real Jordon Belfort makes a cameo appearance in the final scene. He is the one who introduces Jordan Belfort (Leonardo Dicaprio) at the motivational speaking event.', u""In an interview with Margot Robbie, she reveals that for the scene where Jordan and Naomi have sex for the first time in her apartment and her dog tries to jump up and bite him that they had trouble getting the dog to jump, so they had to put dog food and chicken livers all over Leonardo DiCaprio's feet and between his toes."", u'This film broke the Guinness World Record for the most swearing in one movie: 681 expletives (equal to 3.81 swears per minute).', u'The scene when Leonardo Di Caprio and Matthew McConaughey are having lunch is supposed to take place in a World Trade Center building.', u""Leonardo DiCaprio's dance scene was done on the spot, but he learned it by himself over decades."", u'Footage of the actual 1991 Hamptons beach party is shown in the film, with Jordan Belfort and then-fianc\xe9e Nadine Caridi (""Naomi Belfort"") can be found on YouTube.', u""In order to show Jordan's state of mind, director of photography Rodrigo Prieto constantly switched lens types.

The film\'s voice coach, Tim Monich, resisted using a generic Irish brogue and instead focused on distinctive dialects of Ireland and Great Britain. As Leonardo DiCaprio\'s character was born in Ireland but raised in the United States, his accent was designed to be a blend of accents typical of the half-Americanized. To develop the unique, lost accents of the Yankee ""Nativists"" such as Daniel Day-Lewis\' character, Monich studied old poems, ballads, newspaper articles (which sometimes imitated spoken dialect as a form of humor) and the Rogue\'s Lexicon, a book of underworld idioms compiled by New York\'s police commissioner, so that his men would be able to tell what criminals were talking about. An important piece was an 1892 wax cylinder recording of Walt Whitman reciting four lines of a poem in which he pronounced the word ""world"" as ""woild"", and the ""a"" of ""an"" nasal and flat, like ""ayan"".

Liotta noted that Hill casually discussed murders and other crimes while eating potato chips.', u""The long tracking shot in the Copa took seven takes.

However, according to Liotta, the casting process took over a year, in which he had to audition several times. The deal was finally sealed during the Venice Film Festival, which both Liotta and Scorsese were visiting. Scorsese was protected by bodyguards after receiving several threats from religious groups due to his controversial The Last Temptation of Christ (1988). When Liotta wanted to take the opportunity to talk to Scorsese about the role again, the bodyguards kept pushing him back. When Scorsese noticed that Liotta remained very calm under this, he knew he had found the right leading man, because the real Henry Hill was also better known for being a calm and silent observer than an aggressive responder."", u'Robert De Niro was so obsessed with authenticity, that during the infamous dinner scene, he actually asked how the real Jimmy would apply his tomato ketchup, this eventually got passed to Henry Hill, who informed De Niro. As such, the way De niro rubs the bottle of Ketchup is, in fact, how the real Jimmy Burke did so in real-life.', u'The ""How am I funny?"" scene is based on something that actually happened to Joe Pesci. While working in a restaurant, a young Pesci apparently told a mobster that he was funny-a compliment that was met with a less-than-enthusiastic response. Pesci relayed the anecdote to Martin Scorsese, who decided to include it in the film. Scorsese didn\'t include the scene in the shooting script, so that Pesci and Ray Liotta\'s interactions would elicit genuinely surprised reactions from the supporting cast.', u""The later life of Henry Hill, after he enters the Witness Protection Program, was also adapted, more humorously, into My Blue Heaven (1990) the same year.

Charles Scorsese, Catherine Scorsese, and Frank Vincent appear in both Wise Guys and Goodfellas.', u""Lorraine Bracco demanded real jewelry to be used for Karen's dresser. The Production Designer rented expensive gold and stones that were protected by armed guards."", u'The long tracking shot through the Copacabana nightclub came about because of a practical problem: the filmmakers could not get permission to go in the short way, and this forced them to go round the back. Martin Scorsese decided to film the sequence in one unbroken shot in order to symbolize that Henry\'s entire life was ahead of him, commenting, ""It\'s his seduction of her (Karen), and it\'s also the lifestyle seducing him"". This sequence was shot eight times.', u""In the movie, Henry and Tommy are seen together many times.

He claims he blew almost all of his mob money on partying and a ""degenerate"" gambling problem.', u'During one of the final scenes, Henry Hill opens his front door and picks up a newspaper. Close inspection reveals that the newspaper is the Youngstown Vindicator. Martin Scorsese included it as an homage to Youngstown, Ohio, which has been called Mobtown USA.', u'Henry states that he and Jimmy could never be ""made"" because they weren\'t of full Italian descent.

He says the voiceovers are the key to the movie, and that they are almost exact quotes from Hill.', u'According to Joe Pesci, improvisation and ad-libbing came out of rehearsals wherein Martin Scorsese let the actors do whatever they wanted.

Her mom thought about a way to convince the producers that Jodie was no longer the girl from Freaky Friday (1976) or Taxi Driver (1976) anymore but a young woman.

For scenes where Jake retires to his corner between rounds, Chapman gradually overcranked his camera by 'ear' from 24fps up to 48fps as Jake walked away (simultaneously adjusting the diaphragm to maintain exposure consistency), and then reversed procedure as Jake emerged from his corner to resume fighting - all in one shot.

He also studied mental illness.', u'Between the time Robert De Niro signed a $35,000 contract to appear in this film and when it began filming, he won an Oscar for his role in The Godfather: Part II (1974) and his profile soared. The producers were terrified that De Niro would ask for a deserved large pay raise, since Columbia was very discomfited by the project and were looking for excuses to pull the plug on it, but De Niro said he would honor his original deal so the film would get made.', u'When Paul Schrader was first writing the script, he believed that he was just writing about ""loneliness,"" but as the process went on he realized he was writing about ""the pathology of loneliness."" His theory being that, for some reason, some ""young men"" (such as Schrader himself) subconsciously push others away to maintain their isolation, even though the main source of their torment is this very isolation.', u'Director Martin Scorsese claims that the most important shot in the movie is when Bickle is on the phone trying to get another date with Betsy. The camera moves to the side slowly and pans down the long, empty hallway next to Bickle, as if to suggest that the phone conversation is too painful and pathetic to bear.', u'The scene where Travis Bickle is talking to himself in the mirror was completely ad-libbed by Robert De Niro. The screenplay details just said, ""Travis looks in the mirror."" Martin Scorsese claims that he got the inspiration for the scene from Marlon Brando mouthing words in front of a mirror in Reflections in a Golden Eye (1967).', u'Paul Schrader wrote the script in ten days via two drafts, one after the other. As he was writing, he kept a loaded gun on his desk for motivation and inspiration.', u'Jodie Foster claims that Robert De Niro would regularly phone her up and suggest they have coffee together. They would then rehearse the diner scene over and over to the point where Foster got bored, but still De Niro would insist they continue rehearsing.', u""Jodie Foster was 12 years old when the movie was filmed, so she could not do the more explicit scenes (her character was also 12 years old). Connie Foster, Jodie's older sister who was 19 when the film was produced, was cast as her body double for those scenes."", u""The story was partially autobiographical for Paul Schrader, who suffered a nervous breakdown while living in Los Angeles. He was fired from the AFI, basically friendless, in the midst of a divorce and was rejected by a girlfriend. Squatting in his ex-girlfriend's apartment while she was away for a couple of months, Schrader literally didn't talk to anyone for many weeks, went to porno theaters and developed an obsession with guns. Schrader was working at the time as delivery man for a chain of chicken restaurants. Spending long days alone in his car, he felt--I might as well be a taxi driver. He also shared with Bickle the sense of isolation from being a mid-Westerner in an urban center. Schrader decided to switch the action to New York City only because taxi drivers are far more common there. Schrader's script clicked with both Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro when they read it."", u'Robert De Niro has said that, despite having won an Oscar for The Godfather: Part II (1974), he was still a relatively unfamiliar face and was only actually recognized once while driving a New York cab during his research for this film.', u'The producers were looking for a ""Cybill Shepherd"" type to play the female lead in the film. When agent Sue Mengers heard this, she reportedly called them and asked why not hire Cybill Shepherd.', u""Lone assassin John Hinckley's attempt on US President Ronald Reagan's life (Monday 30 March 1981) was apparently triggered by Robert De Niro's obsessive Travis Bickle and his plot to assassinate a presidential candidate. Coincidentally the assassination attempt caused the 53rd Academy Awards ceremonies to be postponed for one day until Tuesday 31 March 1981 when De Niro won his Best Actor Oscar for Raging Bull (1980)."", u'Harvey Keitel was originally offered the part of the campaign worker, eventually played by Albert Brooks. He decided to take the role as the pimp, even though in the script he was black and only had about five lines.', u""Harvey Keitel rehearsed with actual pimps to prepare for his role. The scene where his character and Iris dance is improvised, and is one of only two scenes in the film that don't focus on Bickle."", u'Bernard Herrmann\'s wife says that when Martin Scorsese, then relatively unknown, called her famous husband to ask Hermann to do the score, he at first refused saying, ""I don\'t write music for car movies."" Hermann only accepted after reading the script, and then wrote a highly original score using dissonant brass to punctuate the inner emotions of Travis. After the initial scoring sessions, Scorsese called his composer again, insisting that he needed one more musical cue--a sting, a single frightening chord. Hermann called back a studio orchestra who were paid a day\'s work for that one effect. Shortly after that ultimate session, Hermann died at the age of 64. He had begun his film career in Hollywood writing the music for Citizen Kane (1941).', u'Producer Julia Phillips tells in her auto-biography that Cybill Shepherd had a hard time remembering her lines during the coffee-and-pie scene with Robert De Niro. She writes that De Niro in particular was getting fed up with her and that Phillips and editor Marcia Lucas laughed over all the unusable footage they had to work with in the editing room.', u""In Paul Schrader's original screenplay, the characters of Sport, the Mafioso and the hotel clerk were all black. Martin Scorsese felt that, combined with other events in the film, this would have stacked the deck too much towards racism, and suggested that those characters be changed to white men. Schrader relented."", u'Paul Schrader wrote the part of Travis with Jeff Bridges in mind.', u'Martin Scorsese has said he offered the role of Travis Bickle to Dustin Hoffman. According to Hoffman, he turned the role down because he ""thought [Scorsese] was crazy!"" He has since regretted his decision.', u'Steven Prince improvised the list of additional illegal things Easy Andy had for sale after Travis buys the gun.', u'In the coffee and pie scene, Travis orders apple pie with melted cheese.

Phillips further revealed that Scorsese and Shepard had a difficult relationship on set, with the director having to feed the actress line readings to achieve a credible performance.', u'Travis Bickle\'s famous ""You talkin\' to me?"" scene may have been inspired by Robert De Niro\'s training under Stella Adler, who (as an exercise) had her students practice different interpretations of a similar phrase. The legendary acting teacher was surprised to see one of her former students use ""You talkin\' to me?"" as a psychotic mantra. Martin Scorsese was encouraging De Niro just below the camera while shooting the scene, which led to the rest of the ""dialogue"" Bickle has with his mirror.', u'The clash between Martin Scorsese, the MPAA and the executives at Columbia over the violent content of this film has gone into legend. One of the biggest rumors is that, when facing an X rating from the MPAA and having to edit the film, Scorsese stayed up all night drinking with a loaded gun in his hand, preparing to shoot the executive at Columbia the next day. After an entire night of persuasion from his friends, Scorsese decided to mute the colors in the violent climax and subsequently got his R rating. There are many variations on this legend, one saying that Scorsese was actually planning to take his OWN life; another says that he actually brought the gun to Columbia and threatened the executive until the executive relented.', u'Paul Schrader was inspired to write the script after reading the published diary of Arthur Bremer, the man who was convicted of shooting presidential hopeful George Wallace. Eerily, Bremer was 26 years old in 1976 (the year the film was released), the same age as Travis Bickle in the film. And Schrader himself was 26 when he first wrote the screenplay, in 1972.', u'Melanie Griffith was originally offered the role of Iris, but her mother Tippi Hedren made her turn down the offer. She was the first choice to play the part.', u'Robert De Niro has claimed that the ""You talkin\' to me?"" scene was inspired by Bruce Springsteen\'s banter with his audience at a mid-\'70s gig', u""Brian De Palma was also considered to direct but the producers were dragged to a private screening of Mean Streets (1973) (Robert De Niro and Martin Scorsese's previous collaboration) before they told Scorsese he could direct, but only if he got De Niro to play the lead. De Palma later regretted not directing the film."", u'This was the last Columbia feature to use the classic Torch Lady logo in her classic appearance.', u'Before Jodie Foster was eventually cast as Iris, there were more than 250 applicants for the role, including newcomers Carrie Fisher, Mariel Hemingway, Bo Derek, Kim Cattrall, Rosanna Arquette, Kristy McNichol and Michelle Pfeiffer.', u""Due to injuries sustained in an accident during the production of the 1975 movie The Farmer (1977) actor George Memmoli had to decline the bit-part of the Travis's disturbed passenger who was ultimately played by the film's director Martin Scorsese."", u""According to Albert Brooks in a conversation he had with Paul Schrader after the film wrapped, Schrader had praised Brooks' performance as Tom because that was the one character Schrader didn't understand. Brooks was amused at that fact, given that Schrader didn't understand the campaign manager but did understand Travis Bickle."", u""The cab Travis drove was Checker. They stopped production after 1982 and the last one in New York City was retired in 1999. De Niro's temporary hack number was: 265216.

Herrmann died on Christmas Eve of 1975, just hours after completing the recording sessions for this film, and the movie was dedicated to his memory."", u'Before becoming a star, Robert De Niro thought about writing a screenplay himself. One of the ideas he had was, in the words of biographer Shawn Levy, ""about a lonely man wandering New York City with guns and dreaming of an assassination."" It never went any further than the idea stage, but it was an eerie coincidence when De Niro found Paul Schrader and this film a few years later.', u'The line ""You talking to me?"" was voted as the #10 movie quote by the American Film Institute, and as as the #8 of ""The 100 Greatest Movie Lines"" by Premiere in 2007.', u'Due to a garbage strike, much of the on-screen filth is real.', u""Bernard Herrmann's score is intentionally devoid of strings, giving the overall thrust of the soundtrack more 'muscle'."", u'The restaurant where the cabbies gather to eat was a real-life hangout for taxi drivers called the Belmore Cafeteria at 28th St. and Park Avenue South.

Paul Schrader agreed to take about the same amount for his screenplay, despite having just sold another one (The Yakuza (1974)) for 10 times that amount. The rest of the main cast and Martin Scorsese also worked for less than normal. Cybill Shepherd took $35,000; the director made $65,000. The total budget was around $1.8 million, of which less than $200,000 went to talent salaries.', u'In 2011, Empire magazine described this movie as ""a vivid fever dream we still haven\'t woke up from.""', u'After seeing ""every blonde in town"", producer Julia Phillips still preferred Farrah Fawcett over Cybill Shepherd for the role of Betsy.', u'When Brian De Palma was attached to the project, he wanted Melanie Griffith to play Iris, but after two weeks of casting, both Griffth and De Palma were fired.

However, Martin Scorsese has confirmed in interviews that Bickle was definitely a Vietnam veteran: he said that Bickle\'s mental instability tied into the nation\'s feelings after the war ended in 1975, and also that the Mohawk haircut Travis gets before the climatic violent rampage was inspired by soldiers in Vietnam who would have their hair styled that way before major battles.', u'Due to the bloody content of the brothel shootout scene, cinematographer Michael Chapman agreed to desaturate the colors in post-production. This explains why the blood appears to be pink instead of red in that scene. Later, when the DVD was being prepared, Martin Scorsese wanted to replace it with the original shot, with the blood in its original vivid redness, but no print of that original scene could be found, so the DVD still has the muted colors.', u""Despite being criticized for its violence, only four characters die: the armed robber in the corner shop that Travis shoots, the pimp, the Mafioso and the doorman.

This detail was suggested by actor Victor Magnotta, a friend of Martin Scorsese\'s who had a small role as a Secret Service agent and who had served in Vietnam. Scorsese later noted, ""Magnotta had talked about certain types of soldiers going into the jungle. They cut their hair in a certain way; looked like a Mohawk ... and you knew that was a special situation, a commando kind of situation, and people gave them wide berths ... we thought it was a good idea.""', u""In this film, Jodie Foster plays a woman held captive by the villain, played by Harvey Keitel. Robert De Niro's actions in this film provoked John Hinckley, who was obsessed with Foster, to try to get her attention by shooting President Ronald Reagan. The opportunity to reverse her role in this film, and also distance herself from Hinkley, is in part what inspired Foster to take the role of the heroine and rescuer in The Silence of the Lambs (1991). Harvey Keitel would play her future mentor in the prequel, Punainen lohik\xe4\xe4rme (2002)."", u'Taking place in an actual apartment, the tracking shot over the murder scene at the end took three months of preparation just because the production team had to cut through the ceiling in order to get it right.', u""Bickle's attempted assassination of Senator Charles Palantine inspired John Hinckley's attempted assassination of US President Ronald Reagan on March 30, 1981. Prior to the crime, Hinckley had been stalking Jodie Foster at Yale Iniversity, due to his obsession with her character Iris in Taxi Driver (1976). In a letter wrote to Foster, he told her that he was going to assassinate the President, so he could impress her. Reagan was shot in the chest and wounded by Hinckley, Jr., who was committed to a psychiatric facility when he was found not guilty by reason of insanity in 1982. He was released on September 10, 2016 after 34 years in confinement."", u'On the Laserdisc audio commentary, Martin Scorsese acknowledged several critics\' interpretation of the film\'s ending as being Bickle\'s dying dream. He admits that the last scene of Bickle glancing at an unseen object implies that Bickle might fall into rage and recklessness in the future, and he is like ""a ticking time bomb."" Paul Schrader confirms this in his commentary on the 30th-anniversary DVD, stating that Travis ""is not cured by the movie\'s end"", and that ""he\'s not going to be a hero next time.""

Everybody\'s playing this like a documentary part of themselves in this picture, and so am I.""', u""Kris Kristofferson plays an important role in this movie. In Martin Scorsese's next movie, the widely acclaimed Taxi Driver (1976), there is a scene in which Robert De Niro's character gives Cybill Shepherd's character a Kris Kristofferson vinyl as a present."", u'In a documentary about the making of the film, Ellen Burstyn\' describes how the wind kept whipping her hair around during the scene where Alice and David are talking as he\'s mending fences on his ranch and kiss for the first time. ""The camera operator told me I should always do love scenes in a high wind: \'It does something for you.\'""', u""Martin Scorsese decided to keep the camera in almost constant motion to reflect Alice's emotional turmoil and indecisiveness."", u'Ellen Burstyn often drew on her own experiences, including her relationship with her son, Jefferson, who travelled with her on location wherever she was working and was a young teen at the time of production. He plays the son of her neighbour and best friend of Tommy in the opening sequences set in Socorro, New Mexico. She would tell Martin Scorsese about conversations and incidents between her and her son, as well as things that happened off camera with Lutter, and he would include them in various scenes.', u""Barbra Streisand was originally offered the lead role, but turned it down because she thought she was too young at the time. Also, she didn't think people would accept her as a failed lounge singer."", u""The first cut was three hours and sixteen minutes. Martin Scorsese trimmed it down to just under two hours for its release, losing entire sequences and characters. He was especially unhappy about losing so much of the Socorro sequence, which he believed would have made Alice's husband into a more fleshed-out character. He wanted this part of the movie to be about a third of the picture's running time, but preview audiences were bored with it and felt the movie really didn't get started until she and Tommy hit the road."", u'Ellen Burstyn initially considered asking Barbara Loden to direct the film but decided on Martin Scorsese as she wanted the film to have a ""rough"" look to it.', u'""Alice Doesn\'t Live Here Anymore"" was the title of an episode of The Brady Bunch (1969) that aired on October 17, 1969, more than four years before the film came out. It was based on the 1933 song ""Annie Doesn\'t Live Here Anymore,"" written by Joe Young, Johnny Burke, and Harold Spina, and popularized by Guy Lombardo and His Royal Canadians.', u'According to Ellen Burstyn, nothing daunted Alfred Lutter III. She said he was a ""very secure little boy"" and a lot like his character, which she described as both ""brilliant and annoying.""', u'Martin Scorsese said that Alfred Lutter III improvised the last line in the film, ""Mom, I can\'t breathe,"".', u'Harvey Keitel improvised the bit about the scorpion hanging around his neck.', u'According to her autobiography, Anne Bancroft was attached to the project.', u'The film cast includes two Oscar winners: Ellen Burstyn and Jodie Foster; and four Oscar nominees: Kris Kristofferson, Diane Ladd, Laura Dern and Harvey Keitel.', u'The set for the opening sequence cost $85,000. Martin Scorsese called it ""the first time in my movie career that I was able to build a proper set."" According to Scorsese, he had the services of Darrell Silvera, set decorator of Citizen Kane (1941), The Magnificent Ambersons (1942), and Cat People (1942), along with other pictures from Val Lewton\'s legendary horror unit at RKO in the 1940s. Silvera, however, is not credited.', u'When Ellen Burstyn won the Academy Award for Best Actress, she was not able to attend the Oscars that night to accept her Oscar in person. She asked Martin Scorsese to accept the award on her behalf. She also asked Scorsese to thank himself upon accepting her Oscar.', u'According to Martin Scorsese veteran cinematographer Russell Metty happened to be present at the studio and shot the tests for the opening sequence.', u'Movie critic Pauline Kael recommended to screenwriter Robert Getchell that Robert Altman would have been a good choice to direct the film.', u'While scouting locations in downtown Tucson, Martin Scorsese noticed the Manhattan Bar sign and put the bar in the film in tribute to his New York City hometown.', u'Ellen Burstyn\'s Oscar\xae was delivered to her in a liquor box by Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau at the stage door of the Broadway theater where she was working. She asked Matthau what an Oscar\xae really meant, and he told her, ""Let\'s put it this way, Ellen. When you die, the newspapers will say, \'The Academy Award-winning actress Ellen Burstyn died today.\'""', u'In her autobiography, ""Lessons in Becoming Myself"", Ellen Burstyn lamented not taking producer credit for the project she found and brought to the studio, and for which she hired the director. ""If I\'d been executive producer, I would have been part of the deal when it was sold as a television series and had a piece of what John Calley told me were the \'mega millions\' Warner Bros. made.""', u'The real filming location of Mel\'s Diner from the movie was an actual diner on Main Avenue, called, ""Dukes Drive-In"", which operated from 1940-1971. The owners later added a small motel, which is visible in some scenes. The motel has since been demolished.', u'Vera offers Tommy a book to read: ""The Bride Screamed Murder."" When he holds it up to look through it, you can see that the author\'s name = Terry Molloy. Terry Malloy is the name of Marlon Brando\'s character in On the Waterfront (1954).', u'Martin Scorsese felt that editing down the movie from more than three hours to less than two made the story very simplistic, whereas the longer version ""was quite three-dimensional.""', u""Martin Scorsese was attracted by Ellen Burstyn's background with the Actors Studio. He felt that with New York-trained actors like her, Diane Ladd, Harvey Keitel, and Lelia Goldoni in the cast, he could work with improvisations and incorporate them into the script. The process, he said, was inspired by the films of John Cassavetes."", u'John Calley initially asked Ellen Burstyn if she wanted to direct it herself, but she didn\'t have the confidence. She told him she wanted someone new and exciting and called Francis Ford Coppola for a recommendation. He told her to watch Mean Streets (1973) by Martin Scorsese. Burstyn was very impressed with the picture, but she was concerned because it was very male-dominated. She set up a meeting with the young director, whom she found nervous and uncomfortable. She told him she liked his film but that she wanted this one made from a woman\'s point of view. ""What do you know about women?"" she asked. His pleasant reply--""Nothing, but I\'d like to learn""--won her over.', u'While he was finishing work on the film, Martin Scorsese was also working on his documentary Italianamerican (1974) about his parents. Observers noted that the relationship between Scorsese and his mother in that film echoed the give-and-take between Alice and Tommy in this one.', u'This can be seen as the opposite of the movie Men Don\'t Leave (1990). In ""Alice"" the title character\'s life is resurrected by her husband dying. She is able to leave an abusive marriage, pursue a dream she\'s always had, and become independent for the first time in her life. In ""Men Don\'t Leave"" Jessica Lange\'s husband dies and her life is turned completely upside down. Eventually she finds a job and moves on and survives, but her quality of life deteriorates severely after her husband\'s death.', u'Ellen Burstyn noted in a March 1975 interview that it ""broke the house record for the first week at the Sutton Theater [in New York], and all the men who said it wouldn\'t work are eatin\' crow.""', u'The opening sequence of Alice as a little girl in Monterey was the last footage to be shot on the old Columbia sound stages on Gower Street in Hollywood.', u'Diana Ross was considered for the lead role.', u'Martin Scorsese told film scholar Richard Schickel he was attracted to the project as a way of exploring his ability to make a genre film in Hollywood. ""It was something like a vehicle, like a Bette Davis vehicle or a Joan Crawford vehicle,"" he said. ""So I felt this would be a way of embracing the genre.""', u'Early drafts of the script contained some very different approaches to what was eventually seen on screen. There was some thought of having Alice divorce her husband and run away, but Martin Scorsese liked the idea that his death happened out of the blue--""the hand of God,"" he called it--that forced her to make the decision to change her life.', u'Martin Scorsese scheduled several weeks of rehearsal before principal photography began, allowing the actors to improvise many scenes. Robert Getchell sat in on these sessions, taking notes and incorporating the improvised material into the script.', u""Martin Scorsese was convinced by John Calley that working successfully on the film would show Hollywood that he could make a commercial film from someone else's script with established talents, a big budget, multiple locations, and starring a woman."", u'Martin Scorsese, whose astrological sign is Scorpio, borrowed the scorpion necklace Harvey Keitel wore in the movie and wore it on set during production. He later said it was for him a symbol of the anger he was suppressing while making the film. Scorsese also said the production was ""a kind of therapy for me.""', u'The day after winning her Oscar, Ellen Burstyn received a congratulatory phone call from Jackie Gleason. In her early days, as Erica Dean (one of her many stage names), she worked on his show as a ""Glea Girl,"" a cast of pretty faces who introduced various segments of the program. ""I haven\'t heard from him in 20 years,"" she told the New York Post\'s Earl Wilson. Gleason had also placed a call to Best Actor winner Art Carney. Burstyn later said she really wanted to win alongside Carney, having played his daughter in Harry and Tonto (1974), the film for which he won his award and which she made just prior to this one.', u'Ellen Burstyn said in a contemporary interview with The New York Times: ""I\'m still not entirely happy about the ending, but we don\'t say definitely they\'re getting married. We say that whatever they do will have to include Alice\'s aspirations. I think any way we ended it would have been partly unsatisfactory because this movie is about something we\'re all going through right now, and nobody knows how it\'s all going to end.""', u'Warner Bros. cast Ellen Burstyn after seeing the dailies for The Exorcist (1973). They sent her a number of scripts, but she felt every female in them was either a victim, the understanding wife of the hero, or some sort of sex object, but never the protagonist.', u'The opening fantasy flashback sequence, of which Martin Scorsese was particularly proud and excited, actually drew the most negative reaction from reviewers.', u'Vic Tayback as diner owner Mel was the only cast member to play in the television series adaptation.', u'Ellen Burstyn was eager to work with Martin Scorsese because she liked the vibrant immediacy of Mean Streets and thought that edge could keep Alice from becoming too glib and facile and too much of a formula ""woman\'s picture.""', u'In the earliest version of the script, one Martin Scorsese never saw, Robert Getchell had Tommy commit suicide.', u'At the beginning of the film, Alice promises Tommy that she\'ll take him to Monterey, California, before his birthday; the last shot of the film shows Alice and Tommy walking down a road in Tucson towards a big sign for a shopping center called ""Monterey Village"". The shopping center is at the intersection of Speedway and Wilmot in Tucson.']","[u'USA::9 December 1974 (Los Angeles, California)', u'USA::29 January 1975 (New York City, New York)', u'France::12 May 1975 (Cannes Film Festival)', u'France::30 May 1975', u'UK::5 June 1975 (London)', u'Italy::11 June 1975', u'Sweden::30 June 1975', u'Ireland::11 July 1975', u'Denmark::11 August 1975', u'Netherlands::14 August 1975', u'West Germany::26 September 1975', u'Austria::3 October 1975', u'Finland::31 October 1975', u'Japan::22 November 1975', u'Uruguay::1 December 1975', u'Hong Kong::25 December 1975', u'Philippines::29 January 1976 (Davao)', u'Belgium::6 May 1976 (Gent)', u'Spain::17 May 1976 (Barcelona)', u'Poland::10 January 1977', u'Hungary::19 May 1977', u'France::October 1997 (Montpellier Mediterranean Film Festival)', u'Germany::February 2004 (Berlin International Film Festival)', u'Greece::28 March 2005 (DVD premiere)', u'Canada::12 September 2007 (Toronto International Film Festival)', u'Italy::25 October 2007 (Rome Film Festival)', u'France::27 June 2012 (re-release)', u'Australia::11 June 2016 (Sydney Film Festival)', u'Germany::27 June 2016 (Munich International Film Festival)']",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
