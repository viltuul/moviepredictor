Just before the ten year option ran out, and in order to meet the terms of the contract so they would have first refusal to renew them, Constantin films hurriedly had put this film into production. Marvel were not impressed at the low budget results and in order to avoid damaging the brand they quietly bought the few film prints and negative from Constantin films to avoid the possibility of it getting any kind of theatrical or video release. (but not before somebody in the industry had managed to make an illicit video copy). Both Roger Corman (who produced the film), the director Oley Sassone and the cast and crew of the film were not consulted or informed of this move, as there were indeed plans in place for a small theatrical release and a trailer had been made with this in mind. It is rumored that Marvel subsequently had all the film prints and the negative destroyed.The end result was that Constantin films were able to keep another ten year option on the Fantastic Four film series. After Cnstantin Films secured funding from 20th Century Fox the big budget 2005 version was the end result, After the box office success of the 2005 version, and several years before Marvel had formed their own film studios, Marvel then renewed Constantin Films ten year option and this resulted in the 2007 sequel and the 2015 reboot. However the critical and financial failure of the 2015 version made Fox get cold feet in the FF project and withdrew t concentrate on keeping hold of it's more successful and profitable Marvel Franchise, 'The X-Men'.

Brosnan was disappointed that the predicted boom in dinosaur films never occurred, and the novel received little attention in the UK. The novel was first published in the United States in 1989 by Bart Books, though with little success.', u""Although John Brosnan disliked Roger Corman's film adaptation of the novel, he nonetheless credited it with having raised greater awareness of his original story."", u'Original author John Brosnan (who wrote the book under the pseudonym Harry Adam Knight) was first approached to write the screenplay in mid-1991 by Roger Corman\'s wife Julie Corman, who formalized the deal at Brosnan\'s drinking club, and drew up the contract on a bar napkin. As the film was meant to compete with Jurassic Park (1993), Brosnan later wrote that he was taken aback when it was revealed that the film\'s budget would have only been $1 million. Although concerned that the restrictive budget would require a reduction in the amount of dinosaurs used, Corman assured him that he was free to write whatever he wanted, and that any modifications would be made in the final draft. Once Brosnan sent his first draft to Hollywood, he lost all contact with the film crew. His screenplay had in fact been heavily revised to the point where his credit had been reduced to ""original story"".', u'The movie bares little resemblance to the original 1984 novel by Harry Adam Knight, the pseudonym for Australian author John Brosnan. The book is set in England and is about a reporter investigating a strange series of brutal deaths which seem to be caused by a wild animal, but is in fact dinosaurs that have been brought back from extinction by an eccentric lord. The book features much carnage caused by many more dinosaurs than the film adaptation, such as a Deinonychus, Megalosaurus, Tarbosaurus, Plesiosaur, Dilophosaurus, Altispinax, Scolosaurus, Tarbosaurus, Deinonychus, Tyrannosaurus, and Brachiosaurus.', u'Body count: 32.']","[u'USA::21 May 1993', u'Germany::September 1993 (video premiere)', u'Japan::September 1993 (video premiere)', u'Sweden::November 1993 (Stockholm International Film Festival)']",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

He also had braces on both legs, and had difficulty standing or walking without his cane; the weakness of his legs is visible in some scenes. Fortunately, Karloff lived long enough to view the completed film as well as enjoy the accolades he deserved for his performance.', u'Roger Corman told Peter Bogdanovich he could make any film he wanted to, with two conditions: he had to use stock footage from The Terror (1963), and he had to hire Boris Karloff for two days (Karloff was under contract and owed Corman those two days). Karloff was so impressed with the script that he refused pay for any shooting time over his contracted two days. He worked for a total of five days on the movie.', u'The sequence with Bobby Thompson shooting people in cars driving on a freeway from the top of an oil storage tank was loosely inspired by the Highway 101 sniper attack where on April 25, 1965, a 16-year-old alienated youth, named Michael Andrew Clark, shot at motorists from a hilltop along Highway 101 just south of Orcutt, California, killing three and injuring 10 others before committing suicide. Prior to the shooting spree, Clark left behind a note vowing to make his parents ""die a thousand times in court"" for his actions, and he was right; a lawsuit was brought against Clark\'s parents by two of the victim\'s families for mistreating and not raising their son well, and negligence for allowing Clark access to the hunting rifle used for the shooting spree.', u'The story Orlok tells of the servant fleeing death is W. Somerset Maugham\'s short story ""The Appointment in Samarra."" Reportedly, Karloff nailed the telling of the story in a single take, and received a standing ovation from everyone on set.', u'Peter Bogdanovich planned to have Boris Karloff actually appear in the film for about 20 minutes with two days of filming, and have the stock footage from The Terror (1963) add another 20 minutes of screen time for Karloff. In the final movie, Karloff is actually on screen (not counting the scenes from ""The Terror"") for about 30 minutes and shot all his scenes in five days.', u'Aside from background music played on a car radio, there is no musical soundtrack for the movie.', u'The shooter can be heard taking a breath and holding it before each shot when he fires. This is the correct way for a sniper to steady his weapon before pulling the trigger. But when he fires shots at the moving vehicles on the freeway, the crosshairs are centered on the driver or the passenger - which would cause the shooter to miss, because he\'s not ""leading"" his rapidly moving targets. However, director Peter Bogdanovich did this because audiences would not understand why the shooter was aiming well ahead of each vehicle before he fired. They would expect all his shots to miss if the shooter had done this.', u""The house in which Tim O'Kelly's clean-cut character lives with his happy family is given a fantasy look by the cartoonish colors of the walls in each room, and the strange lack of doorknobs on many interior doors. The sparse wall decorations and the smallness of the rooms gives the house a claustrophobic look. Director Peter Bogdanovich did all this to reflect the warped fairy-tale nature of the deranged young shooter's life."", u""Voices of Joey Bishop and announcer Regis Philbin can be heard in background, excerpted from Bishop's late night ABC TV talk show of late Sixties."", u""The sets for Bobby Thompson's home and for Orlok's hotel room are the same set pieces, with some redressing and a new paint job."", u'As the film includes extracts from Roger Corman\'s film ""The Terror"", Corman suggested to Peter Bogdanovich that the little-known actor who appears opposite Boris Karloff in that film should also appear in this one, perhaps in the role of the killer. Bogdanovich turned down this idea. The young actor became world-famous shortly after ""Targets"" first appeared - it was Jack Nicholson.', u""Frank Marshall's parents and then-girlfriend appear as film-goers at the drive-in scenes. The film's dolly grip also appears, as the father shot, to the horror of his son who is sitting next to him in one of the cars."", u'Drive-in scenes were shot at the since-closed Reseda Drive-In Theatre in Reseda, CA, as clearly shown on the marquee and screen tower. Early in the movie, the Sepulveda Drive-In in Van Nuys is briefly shown in the background as Bobby drives down the highway. On the DVD commentary, Peter Bogdanovich incorrectly credits this as being the Reseda Drive-In.', u'Peter Bogdanovich named his own character ""Sammy Michaels"" after Samuel Fuller (whose middle name is ""Michael"") in gratitude for the work Fuller did on the script.', u'Shot in 22 days and completed in December 1967 (copyright 1967). Due to its controversial nature, Paramount only released it after inserting a written prologue denouncing gun violence.', u""According to Peter Bogdanovich's introduction to the film on the DVD, the scene in which Sammy wakes up with a hangover and is jolted when the first thing he sees is Byron Orlok originally called for him to laugh at himself, but he couldn't manage it. Boris Karloff suggested the bit that is actually used in the film - and ad-libbed Orlok's start when he unexpectedly confronts himself in a mirror, as well."", u'The sniping scene at the oil tank was shot without a sound technician. All the noises were added in post.', u""When film cameras, which run at 24 frames per second, film directly off the screen of US televisions, which run at 30 fps, the result is a dark or light bar across the image, rolling from top to bottom. To avoid this effect in the scene when Sammy and Orlok are watching The Criminal Code (1931), in most shots a film picture was matted in over the TV screen, giving a steady picture with no bar. However, according to Peter Bogdanovich's DVD commentary, they couldn't afford to use a matte for the establishing shot for the scene, which pans across the TV's screen, so the bar appears in that shot and only that shot (in Europe, where the TV frame rate is 25 fps, often they simply run the film camera at 25 fps also, for shots with a TV picture in them)."", u'Although the character of Byron Orlock is based on the man who plays him (Boris Karloff), the similarities are very few. Both are respected and iconic British actors known for their roles in horror films, but while Orlock is embittered with the film industry and wants to retire, Karloff never retired and was always grateful for his success in the film industry. Also, while Orlock seems regretful of his status as a ""horror actor,"" Karloff was in fact very proud of his legacy, and was particularly proud of his most famous role, Frankenstein\'s monster.', u'When Bobby writes out the check to buy the sniper rifle, he writes the check out to Boris Karloff.', u""When Roger Corman hired Bogdanovich to direct, Corman asked if Bogdanovich was familiar with the directorial styles of Alfred Hitchcock and Howard Hawks with Hitchcock's work being very concise, efficient and organized while Hawks opted for a more kinetic shooting style that was partly improvised without much organization. Corman advised Bogdanovich to shoot like Hitchcock."", u'In the beginning credits of the movie, it states, ""Radio music supplied by Charles Greene and Brian Stone"". The music that they used was ""Green Rocky Road"", performed by the band ""The Daily Flash"", which Greene and Stone managed.', u""Samuel Fuller advised Peter Bogdanovich to save as much money as possible, in order to have the film's climax be as epic as it could be."", u'Was edited into a GP rated version and re-released in 1971 in order to capitalize on the popularity of The Last Picture Show (1971)', u'Included among the ""1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die"", edited by Steven Schneider.', u'(at around 50 mins) The horror story which Orlok (Boris Karloff) tells directly to the audience in his distinctive voice - about a man in ancient times who flees to another city because he believes Death is planning to take him at a certain time and place - is similar to the wonderful stories by mystery writer Michael Avallone for a 1950s radio program called ""The Frightened"". Karloff\'s powerful delivery of the stories were accompanied by chilling background music and sound effects (including screams, gasps, and terrified pleas for help). In the early 1960s, Mercury Records released thirteen of the stories on two albums entitled ""Tales of the Frightened"" (volume 1 and 2). They can be heard at Archive.org. Karloff also recorded an album called ""Tales of Mystery and Imagination"", which includes The Legend of Sleepy Hollow.']","[u'Italy::June 1968 (Pesaro Film Festival)', u'USA::13 August 1968 (New York City, New York)\n (premiere)', u'USA::15 August 1968', u'Sweden::15 October 1969', u'Denmark::13 March 1970', u'France::31 March 1971', u'West Germany::20 November 1972 (TV premiere)', u'Spain::29 May 1974 (re-release)', u'Greece::14 April 2004 (DVD premiere)']",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

As shown in the film, Aiello, knowing he was marked for death by Capone, did arrange to have a cousin purchase a train ticket for him at the last minute so that he could skip town. However, he was killed by machine gunners from an apartment window opposite his apartment building as he was leaving to catch the train on October 23rd, 1930: A year and nine months after the massacre, not before.']","[u'USA::30 June 1967', u'Japan::29 July 1967', u'Sweden::16 August 1967', u'West Germany::6 October 1967', u'Italy::25 October 1967', u'Finland::3 November 1967', u'France::16 November 1967', u'Mexico::21 December 1967', u'Spain::29 January 1968 (Madrid)', u'Denmark::5 February 1968', u'Hong Kong::23 May 1968', u'Turkey::19 January 1969', u'UK::26 June 2009 (Edinburgh International Film Festival)']",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

A couple of days after its release the DVDs were yanked off the shelves and replaced with new ones that don\'t contain that ending.

These includes images of the plants taking over New York; of Audrey (1) being eaten; and pieces of the deleted extended song sequence - all presented in full colour. The back of some of the trading cards could be put together to form a larger picture of the plants attacking the Brooklyn Bridge.', u'After the 1998 DVD was recalled, there was no colored copy of the original ending in existence to Warner\'s knowledge. The original ending was lost, until Warner used re-discovered color negatives and other production notes with help from Frank Oz and the film\'s creative team.

Also unlike the movie's account, the actual John Ringo--his real name--suffered a severe bout of melancholy following a visit to his family in California in July of 1882 and went on a monumental ten-day alcoholic binge, which climaxed when he sat down under an oak tree, drew his gun and used it to commit suicide."", u'The original story was written by John Bowers and Andr\xe9 De Toth with John Wayne in mind. Wayne loved it and offered Bowers $10,000 for it. The writer thought it was worth more and told Wayne how he felt. The actor reportedly said, ""Well, you wrote it for me. Don\'t you have any artistic integrity?"" Bowers later got $70,000 for it at Fox, and Wayne harboured ill-feelings about the incident, accusing Bowers of selling it out from under him. In addition, Wayne refused to work for Columbia Pictures because its chief, Harry Cohn, had mistreated him years before when he was a young contract player. Cohn had bought the project for Wayne, but Wayne\'s grudge was too deep, and Cohn sold the script to Twentieth Century Fox, which cast Gregory Peck in the role Wayne badly wanted but for which he refused to bend. When the Reno Chamber of Commerce named Peck the top western star for 1950 and presented him with the Silver Spurs award, an angry Wayne said, ""Well, who the hell decided that you were the best cowboy of the year?"". Wayne\'s final film, The Shootist (1976), is very similar to this film.', u'The large painting on the wall behind Gregory Peck\'s chair in the barroom is ""Custer\'s Last Fight"", painted in 1884 by Cassily Adams and reproduced as a lithographic print by Otto Becker from Adams\' original painting. These prints were distributed in 1896 to bars and taverns all over America by the Anheuser Busch Co.', u'The studio hated Gregory Peck\'s authentic period mustache. In fact, the head of production at Fox, Spyros P. Skouras, was out of town when production began. By the time he got back, so much of the film had been shot that it was too late to order Peck to shave it off and re-shoot. After the film did not do well at the box office, Skouras ran into Peck and he reportedly said, ""That mustache cost us millions"".', u'In the original ending Hunt Bromley was arrested by the sheriff, but studio chief Darryl F. Zanuck was so enraged at this resolution that director Henry King and writer Nunnally Johnson concocted the ending where Bromley is beaten up by the sheriff and let go. That satisfied Zanuck more.', u'The western street in this film is the same one used in The Ox-Bow Incident (1943).', u'""Screen Director\'s Playhouse"" broadcast a 60 minute radio adaptation of the movie on June 7, 1951 with Gregory Peck reprising his film role.', u'Bob Dylan\'s 1986 song ""Brownsville Girl,"" co-written with Sam Shepard, alludes to watching Gregory Peck in this film. Peck himself thanked Dylan publicly when he delivered the speech when Dylan was given his Kennedy Center award in 1997.', u'In 1996, veteran character actor Richard Jaeckel, who played ""Eddie"", was diagnosed with cancer at the same time his wife had Alzheimer\'s disease. The Jaeckels had lost their Brentwood (CA) home, were over $1 million in debt and Jaeckel was basically homeless. His family tried unsuccessfully to place him into the Motion Picture and Television Hospital in Woodland Hills, CA. Peck lobbied for Jaeckel\'s admittance, and three days later Jaeckel was placed in the facility. He stayed in the hospital until his death in June 1997.', u'Filmmaker John Singleton has cited this film as influencing him more than any other film.', u""Opening credits: In the Southwest of the 1880's the difference between death and glory was often but a fraction of a second. This was the speed that made champions of Wyatt Earp, Billy the Kid, and Wild Bill Hickok. But the fastest man with a gun who ever lived, by many contemporary accounts, was a long, lean Texan named Ringo."", u'The theme music used in the trailer for this film is actually the theme from Yellow Sky (1948), also starring Gregory Peck.', u'This marked the return of Jean Parker to films after a five-year absence.', u""Cinematographer Charles G. Clarke shot the title backgrounds using Gregory Peck's double."", u""The film's original title was The Big Gun."", u""The film was the second of Henry King's six collaborations with Gregory Peck."", u'Skip Homeier is the last surviving principal cast member.', u""While Ringo was talking to the Marshall in the saloon, he said that he was 35 and hadn't even got a watch. Gregory Peck was 34 at the time."", u'Roger Corman was a script reader at Fox, and advised that this should go straight into production. He also claims to have made contributions and adjustments to the screenplay, but has never been credited.', u'Clark Gable was offered the lead role.', u""Gregory Peck said about 'The Gunfighter' - 'Tis one of my favorite pictures of all the pictures I've made'."", u""Included among the American Film Institute's 1998 list of the 400 movies nominated for the Top 100 Greatest American Movies."", u'This film was the subject of the classic Bob Dylan song ""Brownsville Girl"". It starts: ""There was this movie I seen one time, about a man riding \'cross the desert and it starred Gregory Peck. He was shot down by a hungry kid, trying to make a name for himself, the townspeople wanted to track that kid down and string him up by his neck. \'Turn him loose, let him go, let him say he outdrew me fair and square. I want him to feel what it\'s like to every moment face his death\'"" Then Dylan goes on to compare his own position in pop music to the gunfighter.']","[u'USA::26 May 1950 (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania)', u'USA::9 June 1950 (San Francisco, California)', u'USA::23 June 1950 (New York City, New York)', u'Canada::30 June 1950 (Toronto)', u'UK::10 August 1950 (London)', u'Sweden::21 August 1950', u'Brazil::8 September 1950', u'Italy::8 September 1950', u'Finland::10 November 1950', u'Australia::15 December 1950', u'Belgium::19 January 1951 (Brussels)', u'Portugal::5 June 1951', u'Japan::13 November 1951', u'France::4 April 1952', u'Denmark::21 April 1952', u'Argentina::21 August 1952', u'West Germany::3 July 1953', u'Austria::October 1953', u'Denmark::16 November 1964 (re-release)', u'Austria::August 1965 (re-release)']",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

At the opening of this film, we see Michael explicitly rebuffing the demands of a US Senator, turning the tables by making demands of his own.', u""The golden telephone presented to Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista is based on an actual event. You can see the actual gold-plated (not solid gold) telephone in Havana's Museum of the Revolution (formerly Batista's presidential palace). The replica made for the movie looks pretty much like the original. No reference to the film is made in the information card of the telephone on display."", u'Editing continued up to the release date of the film.', u'Advance bookings totaled $26,000,000 in 340 theaters.', u'This was the first film sequel to receive five Academy Award Nominations for acting. Talia Shire (Best Actress In A Suporting Role), Lee Strasberg (Best Actor In A Supporting Role), Michael V. Gazzo (Best Actor In A Supporting Role) and Al Pacino (Best Actor) all received nominations, while Robert De Niro took home the Oscar for Best Actor In A Supporting Role.', u'In his DVD commentary, Francis Ford Coppola claimed The Godfather: Part II (1974) was the first numbered sequel in film history. In actual fact, the British film Enemy from Space (1957) was the first (released 17 years earlier). The Godfather Part II is the first US film sequel to use such numbering though.', u'Unlike with the first film, Francis Ford Coppola was given near-complete control over production. In his commentary, he said this resulted in a shoot that ran very smoothly despite multiple locations and two narratives running parallel within one film.', u'Vito\'s birthday is December 7. Sonny curses at the ""Japs"" for dropping bombs in Hawaii on his father\'s birthday.', u'Timothy Carey, who had turned down the offer to play Luca Brasi in the original, was offered the role of Don Fanucci in this film. While performing his audition at Paramount Studios in which Francis Ford Coppola and Martin Scorsese were present, Carey pulled a prop gun loaded with blanks out of a pastry box he had with him, and fired a shot at Coppola, before pretending to commit suicide. Reports differ as to whether Coppola immediately offered Carey the role, or whether Carey was removed by security. In addition, the actor made several monetary demands that caused him to be passed over.', u'The line in the movie, ""Michael, we\'re bigger than U.S. Steel"" was voted as the #54 of ""The 100 Greatest Movie Lines"" by Premiere in 2007.', u'The film cast includes five Oscar winners: Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, Robert De Niro, Robert Duvall and Sofia Coppola; and seven Oscar nominees: Talia Shire, Michael V. Gazzo, Lee Strasberg, Danny Aiello, James Caan, Gary Kurtz, Roman Coppola.', u'Anthony Corleone is played by James Gounaris, who was previously played by--and named for--his younger brother Anthony Gounaris in The Godfather (1972).', u'The paper currency that Vito hands to Signor Roberto is historically accurate. The bills used are series 1914 large size $10 Federal Reserve Notes. Large size notes measure 7-3/8 by 3-1/8 inches compared to the small note, printed from 1928 to the present, measuring 6-1/8 by 2-5/8 inches.', u'When Francis Ford Coppola decided to replace Richard S. Castellano, Willi Cicci was planned to be the sole testifier against the Corleones before the character of Pentangeli was created.', u""Production nearly ended before it began when Al Pacino's lawyers told Francis Ford Coppola that he had grave misgivings with the script and was not coming. Coppola spent an entire night rewriting it before giving it to Pacino for his review. Pacino approved and the production went forward."", u""One of Francis Ford Coppola's conditions on returning to direct was that Robert Evans have no involvement whatsoever with the film, as they had frequently clashed while making the first film."", u""After the first film, Francis Ford Coppola joked that the only sequel he'd make is Abbott and Costello Meet The Godfather (1972). It took a lot of arm-twisting by Paramount to change his mind."", u""Robert De Niro became the only actor to win an Oscar for taking over another actor's Oscar-winning performance. He was not, however, the first or last such actor to be nominated for this. G\xe9rard Depardieu was nominated for Best Actor in Cyrano de Bergerac (1990), a role that had already won an Oscar for Jos\xe9 Ferrer. Like Brando, Ferrer had played his role in English. Like DeNiro, Depardieu played the role in the character's native language; in this case French. Years later, Jeff Bridges would be nominated for his performance in True Grit (1969). John Wayne had won his only Oscar for his performance in the original film, which also featured Robert Duvall."", u""Vittorio Storaro turned down the chance to be the film's cinematographer as he felt that a sequel would never match the original The Godfather (1972)."", u'In the original script, Don Ciccio was named Don Francesco. ""Ciccio"" is a Sicilian nickname for Francesco. He is still listed as Don Francesco in closing credits.', u'The orchestra that plays in the band shell during the party scene at Lake Tahoe was actually the Al Tronti Orchestra that played nightly for big names like Elvis Presley and Tom Jones at the Sahara Tahoe Casino/Hotel on the South Shore of Lake Tahoe while this film was being shot. Al Tronti himself sits in the orchestra in the front room (only seen in shadow). He wasn\'t allowed to appear as the orchestra conductor since he looked ""too Italian"" and the orchestra in the movie was supposed to be a West Coast group that not able to play any traditional Italian music.', u'Al Pacino worked extensively with Marlon Brando and Richard S. Castellano in the first film, but he worked with neither of their replacements in this film. Decades later, however, he would have the chance. He appeared together with Robert De Niro in Heat (1995) and Righteous Kill (2008). He also appeared with Bruno Kirby in Donnie Brasco (1997).', u'Robert De Niro was able to appear on-screen with three of his ""children"" in other films. He appeared with Al Pacino in Heat (1995) and Righteous Kill (2008); John Cazale in The Deer Hunter (1978), and Robert Duvall in True Confessions (1981).', u'In this movie, and in his previous film Mean Streets (1973), Robert De Niro is seen running over the rooftops of Little Italy during the annual Feast of San Rocco festival.', u""Mario Cotone, the film's Sicilian production manager, was cast as Tommasino due to his resemblance to Corrado Gaipa, who played Tommasino in The Godfather (1972)."", u""According to the chart shown during the hearings, the Corleone family's buttonmen/soldiers are: Luca Brasi (deceased), Chris Pennari alias 'The Manager', Donato Tolentinicci, Gaetano De Luna alias 'Gary Dee', Roberto Nelenza alias 'Thunder Bob', William Cicci, Pauli Gato [sic] (deceased), Nino Arneldi alias 'The Patch', Victor Vinatonni alias 'Vicky Veal', Calogero Radeni, Rafilo Gernzo, Carmine Caronda alias 'The Plunge', Francis Forducci alias 'The Kid', Ricardo Simmini alias 'Powder', Frank Corteale, Ettore Radeni alias 'Oily Hand', Salvatore Plumari alias 'Sally Pee', Samuel Corocco, Angelo Granelli alias 'The Trojan' (in jail), Gino Corsetta (in jail), Bartolo Neni alias 'O'Neal' (in jail), Joeseph Bronski alias 'Joey Jail' (deceased), Natale Parri alias 'Fat Nat', Alphonse Barino alias 'Al Barret', Gino Fredonna alias 'Pretty Boy' (deceased), Sabastino Sabela (in jail), Lawrence Tippirri, Gaetano Sirillo, Tony Dinegio alias 'Tony Ding', Carmen Della, Frank Darra alias 'Frankie Dare' (in jail), Alphonse Evolloni alias 'Al Ove' (deceased), Peter Leone alias 'The Lion' (in jail), Cassandros Fracca alias 'David Gelly', Charles Locirno (deceased), Cristoforo D'Binna"", u'Was voted the 7th Greatest film of all time by Entertainment Weekly, thus being the most highly ranked sequel on their list and only 6 rankings behind its predecessor.', u'This was the last film printed in the US in the classic ""imbibition"" Technicolor dye-transfer process, which produced better color accuracy and longevity than color print films of the time.

But in the shooting script he is named ""Bussetta.""', u'Just as in the first film (and in the novel), there are elements of the story based on the lives of New York gangster ""Crazy"" Joe Gallo and his brothers. In this film, when Frank Pantangelli is ambushed in the bar and nearly garroted by the Rosato brothers, that incident was based on an attack by Carmine ""the Snake"" Persico against Crazy Joe\'s brother, Larry Gallo. As in the film, Larry was lured to the bar for a ""sit down"" meeting with Persico, who was his friend. Larry was then garroted by members of the Profaci Crime Family, with whom the Gallos and Persico were a part of, in retaliation for Crazy Joe trying to instigate a mutiny within the family. Also as in the film, Larry Gallo was saved by a policeman who wandered into the bar, thus stopping the execution.', u'Vito Corleone was born on December 7, 1891.', u'Although James Caan (Sonny Corleone) plays the elder brother of John Cazale (Fredo Corleone), he is five years his junior in real life.', u'Don Fanucci says that, in order to show proper respect to him, Vito and his friends should allow him to ""wet his beak a little"", by giving him a share of their profits.

Although Fleur du Lac is private property and no one is allowed ashore there, the boathouses and multimillion-dollar condominiums may be viewed from the lake.', u'In 2007, the American Film Institute ranked this as the #32 Greatest Movie of All Time.', u'One of two Robert De Niro movies to win Best Picture. The other one is The Deer Hunter (1978).', u'When Robert De Niro won his Oscar for this film, Francis Ford Coppola had to accept it on his behalf. De Niro was busy filming 1900 (1976). That film also featured Sterling Hayden; who had appeared in the original Godfather; and G\xe9rard Depardieu who, like De Niro, would be nominated for an Oscar for playing a role (Cyrano de Bergerac (1990))that had alreaddy been played by another actor (Jose Ferrer).', u'The first of many Robert De Niro movies running three hours or more in length not counting deleted scenes or almost three hours.

Puzo only agreed on condition that Michael would wait until their mother was dead.', u'As the ""deceased"" Mama Corleone, Morgana King only appeared in the coffin for the establishing shot where her face is clearly visible. In all other shots, Coppola\'s mother, Italia Coppola, stood in for Ms. King since she (King) initially refused to be in the coffin at all.', u""According to the script, the movie's last shot in the film centering on Michael as he gazes at the lake occurs in 1968. That accounts for Al Pacino's additional wrinkles and slightly receded and graying hairline. It was actually the concluding aspect of a scene with his son, Anthony, who declares he will not follow in his father's footsteps. Anthony was portrayed by an actor about 18 years old; the scene was half filmed, but Francis Ford Coppola lost the light before wrapping for the day and was unable to return to complete the scene."", u'According to Robert De Niro in The Godfather Family: A Look Inside (1990), he suggested the idea of Vito wrapping his gun with a towel before he shoots Fanucci.', u'The shooting script included a scene with an older, diabetic Michael talking with an 18-year-old Anthony but this scene was cut. The discarded scene also included Connie saying that Fredo drowned in the lake. These ideas were eventually used in The Godfather: Part III (1990).', u'The presence of oranges in all three ""Godfather"" movies indicates that a death or an assassination attempt will soon happen. The Senator is framed for murder after playing with oranges at the Corleone house, and Johnny Ola brings an orange into Michael\'s office before the attempt on Michael\'s life.

As shown in the film, Aiello, knowing he was marked for death by Capone, did arrange to have a cousin purchase a train ticket for him at the last minute so that he could skip town.

I\'ve heard stories that the producers of \'The Dirty Dozen\' actually postponed production of their film an entire year because they realized that our story-lines were so similar.""', u'Producer Roger Corman once described how this film came about: "". . . Bob Campbell [R. Wright Campbell], who had just done [The Young Racers (1963)] for me, had finished a script titled \'The Dubious Patriots\'. Once again, the theme was one I liked very much: bad men sent to do good as a way to redeem themselves and win their freedom. In New York--on the way back from Racers--I gave Picker [David V. Picker] the script on a Friday and he said, \'We\'ll look at it. But we\'re backed up with scripts and it might be a few weeks before I can get to it.\'"" Picker rang Corman on Monday and the picture was given the go-ahead. Corman was surprised because his experience with the major studios was not always positive. Corman added: ""It went that fast. Right place at the right time. The title was changed to ""The Secret Invasion"", which was believed to be more commercial. UA budgeted the production at $600,000, which was double my bigger Poe [Edgar Allan Poe] pictures. The film was shot in the summer of 1963.""', u'Director Roger Corman said of the changes to the original script, ""Initially, the prisoner being held was an atomic scientist, the only man knowing the missing key ingredient in the equations to make an atomic bomb. So by freeing him, the five criminals help unleash atomic warfare. And UA [United Artists] said they liked the idea but not that man. So I changed him to an Italian general who would lead the resistance against the Nazis and thereby facilitate an Allied invasion of Italy. UA wanted them to be full-out heroes with less subtlety than I might have sought. I had wanted them to unwittingly and ironically do something bad on their way to being heroes. But this was the majors, and with a half-million of their dollars at stake, I had a feeling these characters might lack nuance. I knew this was one of the drawbacks to working with the studios--story by committee.""', u""Due to an earthquake in Yugoslavia during filming, the production didn't get all of the Yugoslav soldiers they were promised could be used as extras, along with accompanying military equipment, because everything was needed for rescue and recovery work."", u'Filmed in Yugoslavia, with much of the location work done in the Croatian city of Dubrovnik.', u'A Yugoslav production assistant liked to fire a real gun in the air when clearing the set of people prior to action.', u'Yugoslav government officials demanded that Yugoslav Resistance (""Partisan"") characters wear red stars on their uniforms.
