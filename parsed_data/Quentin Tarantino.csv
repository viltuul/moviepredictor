They would contract a big-name movie star to appear in their movie for one day, for a few frontal shots only, while the rest of the scenes were done with a double filmed from the back. A picture of the big star would then be placed prominently on the movie's poster in order to boost sales. (Example: Bruce Willis' character of Lieutenant Muldoon is never in the same frame with the other actors, indicating that all of his scenes were filmed separately.)"", u""Joel Coen and Ethan Coen refused to give Josh Brolin an audition for the role of Llewelyn in their movie No Country for Old Men (2007), so he asked director Robert Rodriguez to help him shoot an audition tape while Brolin was filming his Grindhouse (2007) segment (Planet Terror (2007)) for Rodriguez. Rodriguez shot and Quentin Tarantino directed the tape, which was shot using a 950,000 dollar digital camera. Marley Shelton, who was playing Brolin's character's wife in Grindhouse, agreed to read the lines for Llewelyn's wife Carla Jean (eventually played by Kelly Macdonald)."", u'Robert Rodriguez first came up with the idea for Planet Terror while making The Faculty (1998). He told Elijah Wood and Josh Hartnett that zombie movies were about to come back in a major way. He wanted to be there first when it happened so he prepared a script. But he only got as far as 30 pages before he got stuck for ideas. And when he got attached to other projects, the zombie craze happened just as he predicted. Rodriguez later commented, ""I knew I should\'ve made my zombie movie.""', u'Deputy Tolo is a terrible shot - he keeps missing his targets through the movie. In Spanish and Portuguese ""tolo"" means fool.', u'The ""machine-gun leg"" effect was pulled off by putting a cast on Rose McGowan\'s leg to keep it stiff and wrapping green first aid tape around it. A gray wrap was sometimes used.', u'Skip Reissig, who plays strip-club owner Skip, isn\'t an actor but is actually Robert Rodriguez\'s real-estate agent. Rodriguez thought he\'d be perfect for the part of the brusque, no-nonsense, tough-talking strip-club owner because, as Rodriguez says, ""That\'s the way he really is.""', u'Robert Rodriguez specifically wrote the part of Dakota for Marley Shelton after working with her on Sin City (2005).', u'Rose McGowan has mysophobia (fear of germs) and had to have the stripper pole sanitized before doing her dance routine.', u'The scene where Dakota jumps out of the window and lands on top of the trash cans was filmed twice, the first shot had a stunt double falling onto a crash mat from the original height and the second had her falling onto the trash cans from a scaffolding at a lower height. A car driving by was put in to disguise the switch.', u'While on set, Robert Rodriguez would play the soundtracks from Escape from New York (1981) and The Thing (1982) to set the mood for the movie.', u""Felix Sabates, who plays Dr. Felix, is a real doctor and is Robert Rodriguez's personal physician."", u'Cameo: Z\xf6e Bell as a zombie feasting on a paramedic. She appears in both Death Proof (2007), and this film, and is one of the small group of actors and actresses to be part of both Planet Terror and the Death Proof world. The others are Rose McGowan, Marley Shelton, Michael Parks, ""The Twins"" and Quentin Tarantino.', u'Wray\'s name is revealed to be ""El Wray"", a likely reference to surf guitar legend Link Wray whose songs were featured in Quentin Tarantino\'s Pulp Fiction (1994) and Robert Rodriguez\'s Desperado (1995). Link Wray\'s first name is also Frederick. ""El Wray"" and El Rey, are homonyms: meaning that they are words that sound the same but mean something else. El Rey is the name of Robert Rodriguez\'s own television network. It means ""king"" in Spanish.', u'The original title for Planet Terror was ""Project Terror"".', u'Robert Rodriguez wrote the first 30 pages of the script for Planet Terror (2007) back in 1998.', u'When Wray is first introduced, he asks the owner of the Bone Shack for a pack of cigarettes. The brand he is handed, ""Red Apple,"" is the same brand that Bruce Willis\' character, Butch Coolidge, is handed in Marsellus Wallace\'s bar in Pulp Fiction (1994). This is perhaps a nod to the much noted friendship between Tarantino and Rodriguez.', u""A box of Great White Bites cereal can be seen in Dr. Block's kitchen. This fictional cereal can also be seen in Rodriguez' kids film, Shorts (2009)."", u'When Tammy is changing her car radio station, the DJ is heard dedicating an upcoming song to the ""departed Jungle Julia.""', u'In Mexico, this film was exhibited in its original unrated version in theaters.', u'Rose McGowan originally suggested her friend Rey-Phillip Santos for the role of El Wray. Instead it went to Freddy Rodr\xedguez.', u""The main character's name is El Wray. In Robert Rodriguez's earlier movie, From Dusk Till Dawn (1996), Seth Gecko is trying to get to a place called El Ray."", u""John Carpenter, who composes the scores to his own films, was originally chosen to compose the score to Planet Terror. Robert Rodriguez ended up taking over the job as composer instead, though excerpts from Carpenter's Escape from New York (1981) score would appear throughout the film."", u'The scene where Wray and Cherry burst out on the motorcycle and Cherry fires the gun was filmed first and then redone with CGI.', u""Michael Parks reprises his character as Sheriff Earl McGraw in Planet Terror (2007).

And Naveen Andrews (Abby) both star in the hit television series Lost (2004-2010).', u'When Rodriguez goes to the BBQ restaurant, he asks J.T. for a smoke. J.T. Gives him a pack of Red Apple cigarettes. Red Apple smokes are in many Quentin Tarantino movies.', u""Partly to avoid traumatizing his son Rebel Rodriguez with knowledge of his disturbing death scene, Robert Rodriguez shot several scenes with Tony surviving all the way to the end of the movie. Some of this is seen on the DVD, but apparently the only complete edit with this footage is a private copy of the Rodriguez family's."", u'Robert Rodriguez found the scene where Dr. Dakota Block leaves son Tony in the car with a gun to be so chilling to film, he didn\'t want to use anyone else\'s children to play Tony, so he used his own son, Rebel Rodriguez, so he wouldn\'t feel as bad ""killing a child"".', u'When asked about the ending, Robert Rodriguez said ""I consider it an anti- Army of Darkness (1992) like ending. In \'Army of Darkness\', Ash is returned to normal suburbia and battles the Undead. In my film, Planet Terror (2007), the characters are taken out of suburbia and now battle the undead in a more barren landscape.""', u'In the scene, at the beginning of the movie, in the strip club, Cherry is zipping up the boot of her right leg when she says ""I need a dramatic change in my life"". Her right leg is also the same leg which is later amputated.', u'Total body count of Planet Terror (2007) segment is 281. El Wrey has 52 kills, Cherri Darling has 50 kills and Sheriff Hague has 13 kills.', u""Planet Terror is also the second film in which both Freddy Rodriguez and Stacy Ferguson, a.k.a.

Exactly 65 years before 2003.', u""Since this film takes place prior to Blaise's exploits with The Network, the criminal organization she ran before becoming an agent for British Intelligence, the character of Willie Garvin, Blaise's right-hand man, does not appear. This is the only official Modesty Blaise adventure (comic strip, novel or film) in which Garvin does not appear."", u""The first scene is based on a true story. In 1942 Peter O'Donnell was on a scouting team in what they then called Persia. Making sure the Germans wasn't going through there to capture the oilfields in the middle east. They were sitting under their camouflage tent one day and a 6 year old little girl (probably homeless) was looking at them from a small distance. They gave her a can of McConnochie's and then she left. They never heard from her again."", u'Shooting took 18 days.', u""There is one major discrepancy between this film and the way Modesty's background is described in the novels and comic strips. According to the flashbacks shown in this movie, Lob, the old man who tutored Modesty, was not only a scholarly professor who knew seven languages and had a great general knowledge, but was also a martial arts master who taught Modesty advanced unarmed combat (despite the fact that Modesty, as a child, is also shown saving Lob from some thieving boys). In the novels and comic strips Lob was the intellectual tutor, but he was totally helpless and needed Modesty to defend him. Modesty learned unarmed combat at a later time in her life, picking it up various places including from masters in the Far East."", u'Producer Ted Nicolaou was originally set to direct, up until a week before shooting, when Harvey Weinstein changed his mind and offered Scott Spiegel a chance to helm the film.', u""The WGA-mandated writing credits for this film are incomplete. The character of Modesty Blaise was created in 1963 by Peter O'Donnell."", u'The film had a long development period with Uma Thurman, Natasha Henstridge, Mira Sorvino, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Nicole Kidman, and Jennifer Lopez considered for the role of Modesty Blaise and Russell Crowe for the role of Willie Garvin. The character of Garvin was eventually omitted from this film.', u'All scenes are shot in chronological order.', u'The film was actually produced in 2002 by Miramax but held for release for more than a year.']","[u'France::February 2004 (DVD premiere)', u'Russia::2 March 2004 (video premiere)', u'Netherlands::23 March 2004 (DVD premiere)', u'USA::28 September 2004 (DVD premiere)', u'Finland::9 February 2005 (DVD premiere)', u'Hungary::15 May 2007 (DVD premiere)']",1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

White from the start to Eric's arrival, blue until Zed passes out after partying, and red from when they prepare to enter the bank until the end. This is pulled off through many subtle touches. For example, the flannel shirt Zed is wearing is blue-plaid during his night out, then switches to re-plaid during the robbery."", u'The bank where Killing Zoe was filmed has since been converted into loft apartments.', u'The much-questioned line, ""Ox, where is thy yoke,"" has been said by Roger Avary to be a total non-sequitur.

Usually it\'s only done with two magazines, though Eric does it with three.', u'After completing Killing Zoe, Roger Avary was asked what insight he\'d gained from becoming a feature director. ""You always see yourself in your work. You see yourself in scripts, in short stories, in poems, in super 8 film. And when I was making this movie, it was so big. It was bigger than anything I had ever done before. That big silver screen with real actors and sync sound and Tom Richmond\'s beautiful cinematography. It was so big that I started seeing all my good sides in it - and all my bad sides. It\'s a bit like therapy. That\'s when I realized what filmmaking was. It\'s really a journey of self discovery. I believe that every filmmaker - no matter how commercial he is, or how much an art house filmmaker they are - when they make their film, it\'s a little bit like what Werner Herzog does. The journey is the reward of making the film. What a filmmaker like Herzog will do is: he will walk to the edge of an abyss and stare into the blackness. And what you see when you stare into that inky pitch is your own face staring back at you. And it\'s terrifying. And it\'s debilitating. And it\'s enlightening. And it\'s horrible. And it\'s wonderful. And it\'s all emotions at once. And it\'s the most intense rush I can ever imagine. And it\'s what I dream about when I\'m not making movies is to go through that again. As painful as it often is, it\'s fun.""', u'Eric Stoltz jokingly said, ""it\'s so refreshing to not play a \'nice guy.\' In reality I\'m such an asshole and it\'s great to play a character that I finally relate to.""', u'While many consider Killing Zoe to be a bomb, Roger Avary explains that, due to creative release methods, it actually made a large profit. ""The frustrating thing is when people call the film a bomb, which it wasn\'t. The business model back then for movies like KZ, which cost $1.4M to make, was to simply get it into WalMart and Blockbuster. To do this, at the time, you were required to have a theatrical release. So what we did was to cut a deal with October Films who released the movie with no ad campaign and in less than 50 theaters. This allowed us to qualify for Walmart & Blockbuster, and I can guarantee that the movie made a frickin\' fortune. Samuel Hadida once told me that because of the margins he had made more money on Killing Zoe than on True Romance (1993). Nevertheless, it\'s constantly being called a bomb. I always considered it a smart business model.""', u""In Ron Jeremy's autobiography, 'The Hardest (working) Man In Showbiz', he placed his cameo in Killing Zoe at number 1 on his list of Top Five Death Scenes."", u'With this film, Roger Avary said he wanted to make ""an art-house film for both the coffeehouse crowd and the exploitation crowd.""', u""Zed and Zoe are never in the same shot until after they've had sex."", u'The woman in the club who wants to be treated like a dog is played by Cecilia Peck, daughter of Gregory Peck. Roger Avary admits that when she arrived on set, in costume, he mistook her for a drag queen.', u""Eric's tears when he sees the gold were real. It was shot on Jean-Hughes Anglade's last day, and he was sad the fun he'd been having all during production was over."", u'One of the shooters during the Columbine Massacre was going around shouting ""this is the best day of my life,"" a line from Killing Zoe. Roger Avary has stated that hearing that made him feel oddly responsible.', u'The proposed title for the unproduced sequel was ""Lucky Day"".', u'Over the years, several video distribution companies (rumors include Criterion and Kino, amongst others) have tried to gain the rights to Killing Zoe. Lionsgate has repeatedly refused all offers, despite their general treatment of the film as merely a ""catalogue title."" This has caused Roger Avary no end of frustration.', u""The scene with Gary Kemp, strung out on heroine, rambling about The Prisoner to his entirely uninterested friends was based on the numerous times Roger Avary had talked (sober) to his friends about the show, even though they weren't interested."", u'Julie Delpy had never handled a gun in a movie before and was very nervous prior to filming. She ended up remarking that firing a machine was more fun than sex.', u""Producer Samuel Hdida and DP Tom Richmond both commended Roger Avary's ability to make spur of the moment decisions, something that first-time directors often struggle with."", u'Producer Samuel Hadida says that Killing Zoe probably employed every French actor in Hollywood at that time, which was not many.', u'The shot of Zed and Zoe laughing in bed was actually a private moment between Eric Stoltz and Julie Delpy. The two were joking around between takes and Roger Avary quietly turned the camera on without them noticing. Avary calls it one of his favorite shots in the film.', u'The first complete film score for the duo of tomandandy (Tom Hajdu and Andy Milburn).', u'Like Reservoir Dogs, Killing Zoe was made at Live Entertainment. Live was later purchased by Artisan. While prepping the DVD release of Zoe, Roger Avary butted heads with the head of the home video department, who reportedly ""hated the film, and viewed it as a catalog title."" Mr. Avary got his way by handing out the department head\'s email address via Ain\'t it Cool News, inundating him with over ten thousand angry emails. Roger Avary believes that in hindsight this may have been a bad idea, since that same department head refuses to release a special edition DVD in America to this day.', u'After reading the first draft of the script, Quentin Tarantino found the story so autobiographical for Roger Avary that he jokingly suggested the title ""Roger Takes a Trip.""', u'The character Zed has several of tattoos.

Roger Avary has stated that ""it represents the monkey on his back.""', u'Roger Avary had to back out of rewriting Pulp Fiction as production was getting underway on Killing Zoe.', u""There is a french poster for Dressed to Kill (1980) in Eric's apartment. Previously, Roger Avary had written the poster into the script for True Romance (1993), which Tony Scott retained when directed the feature."", u""Since this was Roger Avary's first feature film, producers were nervous about whether or not he could direct like a professional. For the first two days of production, 'Don Edmonds' was on set at all times ready to take over if he (and the producers he represented) decided Roger Avary couldn't handle the film. After the second day, he declared Roger Avary a highly qualified professional and left the movie in his hands."", u""The cab driver's lines were dubbed by Djimon Hounsou."", u'The method for breaking into the vault was entirely fabricated by Roger Avary. The large tool Zed uses to drill into the door is in fact a router, used for carving wood. Other pieces include a stud-finder, and a bottle full of carrot juice.', u'Zed setting up his tools was meant to evoke junkies setting up their works.', u'The scene in the elevator with Eric Stoltz and Gary Kemp talking about their plans for the money was improvised by the two actors.', u'Julie Delpy was instructed to kiss Zed\'s wounds, ""like an animal in the woods.""', u'Production lasted 25 days.', u""The image of Eric performing a magic trick, which later became the film's poster, was improvised on the day of shooting."", u'Director Roger Avary took every effort to make sure the masks worn during the robbery were as distinctive as possible. ""I had the actors work closely with the costume designer to design their own masks. I told them I wanted them to be representations of their character\'s inner self. Each is a clue into their character. Stoltz immediately gravitated toward the wolf. Jean-Hugues, the Fant\xf4mas Superstar. We had two sets. One was kept by the actors, the others hang in my home.""', u'During preproduction, Roger Avary invited Kario Salem over to his house to offer him the role of Jean. The two proceeded to smoke marijuana, with Kario quickly getting violently sick and vomiting all over Roger. In his drug-induced delirium he mumbled the line, ""I feel like the whole world is in a bubble of glass, and I\'m rubbing up against it like a bad windshield wiper."" Roger quickly wrote the line down, and included it in Killing Zoe.

He decided to follow his friend Quentin Tarantino's advice from when they were writing The Open Road together (later rewritten as True Romance). He wrote about meeting his dream girl, a girl who thought everything he did was cool. Then he added violence. For Quentin, the girl was Alabama Whittman. For Roger, it was Zoe."", u""The first day of shooting was spent on the nightclub scenes. Everyone was concerned, since it was Roger Avary's first day of his first film, and he was shooting unpredictable, out-of-focus drug footage. After viewing dailies, the crew was convinced Avary knew what he was doing."", u""Jean-Hugues Anglade was the driver for the two shots actually done in Paris. This was after production, and he wasn't under contract. He just happened to by in Paris at the time and offered to help anyway he could."", u'Though Jean-Hugues Anglade translated the English dialogue into French, union rules prevented him from being credited. In the end credits, the translator is credited as ""Yrava Regor,"" which is ""Roger Avary"" spelled backwards.', u'In an interview with Rice Paper, the director compared the film to a ""snowball rolling down a hill. It gets bigger and bigger and bigger, and pretty soon it\'s knocking down trees and consuming houses. The volume has gotten so loud that it just becomes deafening. I wanted that to be the state of mind of the Eric character. Zoe in Greek means life. Everything he does is killing life. It\'s all about deception and self doubt and all those horrible emotions that some people foster.""', u'Killing Zoe had a very hard time finding financing, which Roger Avary attributes to his attitude of ""being prepared to walk away if it won\'t come out they way I want it."" He admits this is why his filmography is so slim.', u""Tom Richmond, the cinematographer, at first thought this was just another B-movie. During pre-production, Roger Avary asked him if he liked The Shining (1980). RIchmond said it was one of his favorite movies. Avary said that he wanted to bank to exist in the same manner as the Overlook Hotel, to have a mind of it's own, and to bring out people's inner being. That conversation convinced Richmond that the movie was much more than a B-movie."", u'During the first day of shooting, director Roger Avary saw his small crew moving cables and equipment around and tried to help. He was quickly told by the key grip, ""you\'re the director. Just hang back, and direct us."" He says this is when he realized that a director\'s job wasn\'t to do everything, but to express to someone else what he wanted done, and let them do it.', u'Eric Stoltz was praised by the director for taking his character of Zed and letting him grow ""far beyond the page."" Avary stated, ""I have a rule as a director to never tell an actor not to do something that they feel. If somebody feels something I allow them to explore it because there\'s a reason for it."" Examples of this include Zed not seeming to care when Zoe is violently ejected from his hotel room without her clothes (in the script he tries to talk Eric down), and the mercy killing of the bank guard (he was written to be unable to shoot him, and just slowly watch as he dies).', u'Roger Avary hired first-time composers tomandandy to score his film because their work reminded him of Goblin (known for scoring the works of Dario Argento) and Tangerine Dream.', u'The line, ""doing heroin here is safer than in Amsterdam"" was said to Roger Avary during a Parisian vacation he took. Avary\'s response was, ""How safe is it in Amsterdam?""', u'The intent of the unfocused scenes of drug use was to not show the audience heroin use, but to make them feel like they were on heroin.', u'The unique framing used in Killing Zoe was inspired by the films of Douglas Sirk. Sirk once famously said, ""Only unite two characters in a frame if they should be united emotionally.""', u'The character Zed is meant to be a dark stand-in for director Roger Avary.', u'Killing Zoe was filmed just after a horror film that required many dead cats. When Roger Avary went to secure a cat carcass for the brief scene in the apartment, he was brought to a warehouse with several large freezers full of dead cats. Ultimately, he chose a tabby.', u""According to the script, Eric's apartment building is actually owned by his father."", u'The first draft was written without an outline. Roger Avary says he just let his emotions run wild, without regard to plot or structure. While the script was rewritten several times, it retained the quasi-autobiographical nature of the initial draft.', u'Roger Avary identifies a major theme of the film being changes in perception; how reality can differ from person to person.', u'Roger Avary knew his screenplay would be a difficult concept for investors to grasp. To show them what he had in mind, he created a faux trailer using footage from various European art and American crime films.', u'Julie Delpy was riding high on the success of Three Colors: White (1994) at the time she was approached with Killing Zoe. Initially she was hesitant to accept the role of Zoe, since Roger Avary was an unproven director. ""After a chance meeting with a tarot card reader on the Venice boardwalk,"" she says, ""I was told I would go on a great spiritual journey."" Since Killing Zoe was the only project she was considering, she decided it must be the film that would cause her journey.', u'Jean-Hugues Anglade says accepted his later role in _Queen Margot (1994)_ in order to get rid of the character of Eric, who he felt was still inside of him.', u'The roots of Killing Zoe are said to be seen in the super 8 short films Roger Avary made as a youth. In an interview given shortly after Killing Zoe\'s release, he said ""I\'ve been thinking of doing a video transfer of them and putting them on the Killing Zoe laser disc. Most people are too embarrassed to do it. And you know what? If you\'re embarrassed to do it, you should just do it. Have no shame. It\'ll be fun."" As of 2012, the shorts have yet to be seen.', u'Roger Avary\'s original script had Eric claim, after killing one of the hostages, that if they get caught now they\'d receive the death penalty. During script reads, Jean-Hugues Anglade pointed out that there is no death penalty in France. This led to the exchange where Eric claims they\'ll get the death penalty, and Zed says he thought France abolished it. Eric replies, ""Yeah, that\'s what they want you to think.""', u'In 2008, Lionsgate made the film available to view for free on Hulu, but without the English subtitles for the French dialogue.', u""In 2013, the film was made available for streaming on Netflix in HD. Unlike the earlier Hulu release, this one includes the English subtitles for the french dialogue. However, it should be noted that it's the American release version, not the European director's cut."", u'When Quentin Tarantino first saw the set for the nightclub bathroom he ecstatically said it was ""the best bathroom to a Dixie-jazz club"" he\'d ever seen.', u'Tom Richmond, the director of photography, said that by the end of production he had to borrow money from his friends and family because he was paid so little. He was still happy, though, as he loved the project and was promised a paid weekend in Paris by Samuel Hadida (to shoot the two car POV sequences).', u'The outrageous level of violence in such 1970s films as Rolling Thunder (1977) and Coffy (1973) was a great inspiration to director Roger Avary. He admired how the violence was both unnervingly brutal and yet still laughable.', u'Several reviewers were unimpressed with the level of violence and gore, and considered a cheap ploy for the horror audience. Roger Avary was quick to point out that he\'s always been interested in violent films, going all the way to the super-8 shorts he made as a teen. ""They were usually kind of gory. We\'d make dummies and stuff them full of newspapers and throw them off bridges, and film it falling. Then we\'d match cut it with my cousin jumping up and down in the river and running around. They were usually crazy things with titles like Psycho Killer and weird things like that.""', u'The line asking Zed if he likes viking films was included because writer/director Roger Avary liked the characters to vikings, ""a bunch of brutes that just rape and pillage and wear funny helmets (in this case masks) and don\'t worry about tomorrow. It\'s all about getting maximum pleasure right now and not giving a shit about if they hurt anybody else or if it has consequences."" This is why Beowulf was assigned reading for the cast.', u'Roger Avary called Eric Stoltz\'s character, Zed, a ""very Bret Easton Ellis character, in that he\'s immersed himself in this world, and he\'s integrated in this world, but he\'s not really part of this world. Not truly. He has a line that he can\'t or won\'t cross."" Roger Avary\'s next feature film world be an adaptation of Easton Ellis novel Fuck the Rules (2002).', u'Roger Avary always thought of the movie as being a very dark comedy. He explained his view by comparing it to that of writing-partner Quentin Tarantino. ""Quentin\'s comedy is juxtaposing. Something funny happens, ha ha ha, then Bang! Someone\'s head blows off and you start questioning \'should I have been laughing just seconds before?\' And while you\'re questioning, something funny happens that takes off the shock, then Bam! Someone\'s eye is sliced open. For me it\'s more of the snowball rolling down the hill, and it gets bigger, and bigger, and soon it\'s eating houses and trees and the volume of the avalanche is massive. And the size of the whole thing, how it began so small and simple, that is hilarious to me."" (source: French dvd documentary)', u'Roger Avary was very burned out after making the movie. While in Paris during Killing Zoe\'s theatrical release, he thought about seeing the movie with an audience, but decided he didn\'t want the distraction of watching their responses. He saw The Crow (1994) instead, which finished before Zoe. In his own words, ""curiosity got the better of me and I popped my head into the theater to see how it was going. And it was packed. The seats were full, people were standing in the aisles, in the back. And everyone loved it; they laughed, they cringed, they were enthralled. I felt great. I took a taxi back to my hotel and the driver turns to me and says, \'hey, would you like a girl for the night?\' And I couldn\'t believe it! It from strait out of my movie.""', u'Roger Avary and Eric Stoltz both said that they\'ve always wanted to rob a bank, though Stoltz added ""and not go to prison."" Stoltz elaborated, ""in America, I don\'t how it is in France, but in America every kid has a toy gun. We all want to shoot someone, pull a heist. This movie is the American dream.""', u'Recreating Paris in Los Angeles was a task far outside of the alloted budget. Roger Avary has said, ""I knew I could never recreate Paris; everything is different over there. Phones are different, doorknobs are different, everything. So I decided to not recreate Paris but instead create a hyper-real junkie\'s universe, where anything goes."" He was reportedly inspired by Werner Herzog\'s ability to create worlds that run on metaphors in place of reality.', u'The title is intending to be ironic, or at least an oxymoron. Zoe is the Greek word for life.', u""According to Roger Avary, the bank is meant to represent Eric's brain."", u'Strangely enough for a feature soundtrack, many of the tracks on the Killing Zoe album are altered from their film versions. When asked about the soundtrack in 2010, Roger Avary had this to say: ""Tomandandy completely remixed their movie music for the album, tuning it to their specific level of sonic perfection. Releasing the tracks different from the film may seem odd at first, but in those days the optical track on the film was lo-fi by tomandandy standards, and had to compete with so many tracks, backgrounds, and audio elements of the movie, that the music needed to be composed ""less deep"" to be able to exist within the available bandwidth. Also, I would edit their music myself during editorial. Some beds of audio were originally composed separate from image, and we would make them fit contextually with the image. Keep in mind, this is with a flatbed Kem and dirty dupes of 35mm film, an entirely different experience that is possible in todays mashup culture. Also consider that philosophically we wanted to create a separate experience, one that existed specifically for the CD. I think this is most strongly felt on Canaan, the end song, which was sung two ways, once by Andy Milburn, and once by Robin O\'Brien, because I wanted feminine phonemes in the end.""', u'Quentin Tarantino made sure to view all the dailies with the cast/crew. Tom Richmond said that at all the most gruesome parts, Quentin would burst out laughing. It was seen as a great assurance of quality for all involved.', u'Roger Avary has said, ""there\'s something so sexy about Julie Delpy walking around with blood on her lips.""', u""As Zed and Eric are walking into the apartment, a distinctive phone is visible to the side. When Roger Avary was in Europe his friends had that exact same phone set up in their apartment, and encouraged him to call anyone he wanted, since it was connected to the neighbor's line. He called his friend and fellow Video Archives clerk Scott Magill and the two talked about Full Metal Jacket (1987), which had just come out. Later that night, Magill committed suicide. Roger considered the phone to be a line to the unseen reality and insisted on putting it in the film."", u'The pet monkey in the apartment was originally meant to jump onto Eric Stoltz and pull his hair. On the day of shooting, the trainer informed Roger Avary that all the monkey was trained to do was ""sit and eat grapes."" In order to get some reaction from it, Mr. Avary resorted to standing just out of frame and making faces to scare the monkey.', u""From the moment Zed and Eric enter the apartment, all the shots are locked. The camera doesn't move again until the reverse zoom when the heroin is cooked and shot up."", u""The decision to shoot most scenes from a single angle was inspired by Roman Polanski's _Repulsion (1965)_. Working with a small budget, it made both stylistic and economic sense."", u'Tom Richmond likened the characters to vampires, stating ""you never wonder why they never go outside, because none of these characters would go outside. Except maybe at night.""', u'Director of photography Tom Richmond considered Killing Zoe to be a professional challenge, as the color red is notoriously hard to photograph well.', u'Eric Stoltz gave an interview where he said, ""It\'s very enjoyable to work with Roger Avary. I\'ve worked with a lot of first time directors and he is the most fun, the most confident. He encourages a certain anarchy on the set which I find very productive.""', u'In the German dubbed version Zed speaks with a broad American accent.', u""Director Roger Avary wanted to shoot at a french McDonald's but was refused permission."", u'The nightclub was based on a jazz club in Paris called The Cave. For Killing Zoe, production redressed a warehouse in downtown Los Angelas.', u'Jean-Hughes Anglade said he played Eric ""in the style of G\xe9rard Depardieu.', u'Several scenes of realistic drug use had to be cut to secure an R rating from the MPAA. They are still present in international versions of the film.', u'Roger Avary gave the cast copies of Beowulf in order to get them in the right mindset.', u""According to the American DVD, to recover from the burnout of Killing Zoe, Roger Avary went to Paris and directed a musical stage version of Beowulf. He doesn't like to talk about it today."", u'Director of photography Tom Richmond has stated ""the idea with the french hotel set was that this would be a real french hotel, not like a movie french hotel. In movies, French hotels always have chandeliers and lace curtains with gold runners. In reality, french hotels are just as lame and boxy as American hotels. That was the other thing, too. We shot the room very squared off. Until Eric shows up, I don\'t know if there\'s really any camera movement at all in that room.""', u'Jean-Hughes Anglade wasn\'t the only one to greatly enjoy the production. Cinematographer Tom Richmond has said, ""Killing Zoe is one of the two most fun work experiences I\'ve ever had, the other being Little Odessa (1994). Those are the two movies I\'ve made that are closest to my sensibilities. Killing Zoe is the only movie I\'ve ever done that finished early.""', u'Roger Ebert called Killing Zoe ""Generation X\'s first bank caper movie.""', u'Roger Avary has joked that he wants a line from Roger Ebert\'s review, ""It must have been even more exhausting to make this film than it is to watch it,"" on his tombstone.', u'Jean-Hugues Anglade would entertain the cast and crew between takes by tying his hair into pigtails and dancing around with the miniature French flags.', u'Roger Avary, who doesn\'t speak French, wrote the French dialogue in English with ""French rhythms"" derived from years of watching European cinema. The actual French dialogue was translated by Jean-Hugues Anglade during table reads.', u'Roger Avary has said that he wanted to make a debut feature that couldn\'t be ignored. He didn\'t want to make something ""quiet, and gentle, easy to miss."" He wanted to ""start fast, right of the gate.""', u""Zed's little box that opens the safe (which is in fact a stud finder) was inspired by the electronic 'key' from Le Samoura\xef (1967) that the lead character uses to break into cars."", u""Despite the majority of Zoe being shot in Los Angeles, many in Hollywood could not tell it wasn't Paris. Producer Morgan Mason was impressed enough to ask Avary to help develop a syndicated mystery TV series about an American in France. Avary accepted the job and set up his office in the south of France. The series eventually fell through, but Avary still maintains an office in France to this day."", u'Roger Avary was not worried about filming his French-set film in Los Angeles. """"It\'s because of Los Angeles that I really got interested in film. I don\'t know that I would have gotten interested in movies as intensely as I had, or been exposed to them the way I had if I\'d lived anywhere else."" He felt honored to shoot his movie locally.', u'Roger Avary has said about his intentions with Killing Zoe, ""I am not a moralist. I don\'t think you can be an entertainer and and a moralist. I think I\'m a moral person, but I don\'t presume to force my beliefs over someone else\'s... in fact, the viewer who sees the film and has a strong reaction against it, is doing exactly what I\'d hoped would happen. He\'s examining his own point of view against another.""', u'Speaking in 1994 about the emerging independent film movement, Eric Stoltz heaped praises on the new directors. ""There\'s this new wave of film directors coming out who did not go to film school. No professor told them what\'s right and wrong. They learned by watching other films. It\'s very much like the French New Wave in the respect. In America, film schools churn out directors who constantly do \'master shot, two shot, close-up\' and it\'s very boring. These guys are willing to try and say things. Whether they work or not remains to be seen, but it\'s very fun to be a part of.""', u'The movie has been described as a ""passion project"" not just for Roger Avary, but for everyone involved. ""Nobody\'s getting rich off this,"" he said. ""Nobody\'s walking home with bags of money, or bars of gold. Jean-Hugues Anglade came half way around the world for almost nothing, just to make this movie. Because he believes in it. That\'s how we all feel.""', u'The paintings seen in the background during the bank-set portions of the film are recreations of works by Jacques-Louis David, one of Roger Avary\'s favorite painters. Avary says, ""When I was in Paris, I used to go to the Louvre and stare at David\'s \'Oath of the Horatii\' because it meant so much to me. David was like the Steven Spielberg of his time, a popular painter who entertained the masses. I love his work.""', u'The music that composers tomandandy wrote for the scene where Zed finally starts to wrestle with Eric was compared to the music from The Omen (1976) by the director.', u'Roger Avary has said, ""in the years since the film\'s release, many people have questioned me about whether Killing Zoe is really all a metaphor for my relationship with Quentin Tarantino. That I\'m Zed and he\'s Eric. I always laugh at that, it was not my intention at all. Maybe something slipped in subconsciously, because that\'s just what I thought a best friend was like. But I certainly didn\'t intend anything.""', u'Roger Avary\'s wife Gretchen Avary is listed in the credits for ""positive visualization."" Roger says, ""believe me, there was a lot of positive visualization needed on this movie.""', u'The Cin\xe9math\xe8que Fran\xe7aise praised the film and heralded director Roger Avary as ""the Antonin Artaud of cinema"" during their Cinema of Cruelty retrospective. Killing Zoe was recognized as being an outstanding example of Artaud\'s Theater of Cruelty philosophy; by ""cruelty,"" Artaud referred not to sadism or causing pain, but rather a violent, austere, physical determination to shatter the false reality that, he wrote, ""lies like a shroud over our perceptions.""', u'Roger Avary stated that, as a first time director, it was a dream to work with such talented veterans as Eric Stoltz, Julie Delpy, and Jean-Hugues Anglade.', u'Writer/director Roger Avary was inspired by a trip to Europe he had taken where he found himself doing ""unethical"" things which he wouldn\'t have considered doing in America.', u'Roger Avary backed out of his deal with the original Cadian producers when they refused to let him cast Jean-Hugues Anglade. He was determined to have complete control over the casting. In Avary\'s words, ""The two things that make a film are script and casting. Once you\'ve done those, your work is almost done.""', u'The split focus diopter shot with Zed and Eric was inspired by Brian De Palma.', u'Zed stays in the Hotel Bonaparte.', u'The idea behind the opening shots of the Parisian streets was that it was a taxi\'s POV, specifically the taxi the Zed grabs from the airport. That\'s why there are no recognized landmarks; he\'s taking the shortest route. Roger Avary felt most people\'s opinion of Paris had been corrupted by Hollywood and, like Eric and Zoe in the film, wanted to show ""the real Paris.""', u'Forced to write a script using a bank location, Roger Avary decided on making a heist film since it ""had the coolest aesthetic.""', u'Eric Stoltz stars in Killing Zoe (1993), written and directed by Roger Avary. Avary co-wrote Pulp Fiction (1994) with his friend Quentin Tarantino, which Tarantino also directed and Stoltz also stars in this film.', u'As an interesting coincidence there might be a hidden meaning behind the title of the film. In French there is an expression for having an orgasm called ""La petite mort"" which literally translates as ""The Little Death"". In one of the earlier scenes Zoe confesses to Zed that she made her orgasm, thus she experienced ""La petite mort"". The title, Killing Zoe, could be a pun and a mixing of American and French colloquialisms since by ""Killing Zoe"" (i.e. making love to her) you are giving her ""the little death"".', u'When asked whether or not Zed was supposed to have contracted AIDS from his bloody confrontation with Eric, Roger Avary replied, ""Look at the title.""', u'Roger Avary instructed Jean-Hugues Anglade to make the same facial expression when he shoots up in the bank bathroom as he does when he gets shot to death. This was done to show that, all along, the high has been death in some form.', u'During the final fight between Eric and Zed, Roger Avary shot some of the action at 8 frames per second. The 8 frames were then triple-printed, creating standard 24 fps. The lowered frame rate purposefully created a very noticeable ""ghosting"" of the images, heightening the surreality of the climax.', u""Zed's mercy kill of the bank guard was included at the insistence of Eric Stoltz, who had never fired a gun in a movie before, and finally saw his chance."", u'In the script, the reason Eric flips out towards the end and starts killing random hostages was because he caught the police trying to sneak in through a sewer grate. As the budget didn\'t allow the creation of a fake sewer, Jean-Hugues Anglade was instructed to ""see rats coming out of the walls, slip into insanity, and leave."" Roger Avary has since called it his favorite moment in the film.', u'Director Roger Avary was the person splashing the blood on Julie Delpy when Eric gets shot to death.', u'The on-set nickname for the shot of Eric just before he dies was ""The Long Second.""', u'Also contains spoiler for the ending of True Romance (1993)] When Tony Scott asked Roger Avary to rewrite the ending of True Romance, Roger decided to end it the same way as the then-in production Killing Zoe: the main character and the call girl simply walk out of the building full of police officers and drive away.', u""The last shot of the film was intended to be a continuation of the car's POV endlessly driving around the traffic circle, with the credits running over the footage. This had to be changed for budget reasons."", u""The American censors forced Eric's death scene to be shortened, as they felt the extreme length was too disturbing.

As a fan and supporter of celluloid, Quentin Tarantino aggressively fought with distributors for the film to be shown in its original Ultra Panavision 70 presentation. As a result, 50 theaters internationally were retrofitted with anamorphic-lensed 70mm analogue film projectors, to display the film as he intended it to be seen. It was released on December 25, 2015, as a roadshow presentation, in 70mm analogue film format theaters exclusively, before being released in digital theaters on December 30, 2015.', u'Quentin Tarantino announced at Comic-Con in 2015 that Ennio Morricone would compose the score for the film.

He had previously used Morricone\'s music in Kill Bill: Vol. 2 (2004), Death Proof (2007), Inglourious Basterds (2009), and Django Unchained (2012). Morricone also wrote a brand-new song, ""Ancora Qui"", for the latter.

However, he did not get far with the novel, before he realized that it didn\'t work to have a character whose morals were known to the audience beforehand, nor a character you felt was fairly sure to survive. Tarantino withheld this trivia from interviews, until after the film\'s release, because he was already contesting false reports that the movie would be a sequel to ""Django Unchained"", and didn\'t want to further muddle early public expectations. This is also why, in the wake of the script\'s leaking online, he was considering taking the story back to novel form, when he considered canceling production.', u'Viggo Mortensen was in talks for the character of Jody Domergue, but had to decline due to scheduling conflicts.

Morricone said he considers the film an adventure movie, rather than a Western, and as a result, he tried to make the music sound completely different from his famous Western scores. He based the music on the feelings that the script evoked in him, rather than composing music for specific scenes. Because Morricone had only about a month to produce his score, he added several pieces of music that he had originally written for The Thing (1982), some of which had never been used.

However, it is brought to an even twenty, if Chester Charles Smithers, and the three bodies that Major Marquis Warren have with him, when hitching a ride with John ""The Hangman"" Ruth\'s stagecoach, are included.', u""Channing Tatum's casting as Jody Domergue, could be viewed as an homage by Quentin Tarantino to Sergio Leone's Once Upon a Time in the West (1968), where Leone cast Henry Fonda as the primary antagonist. At that time, Fonda had been known for playing heroic characters, and he accepted the role after Leone described Fonda's character gunning down a child, and how the audience would be shocked by the scene. This film marks the first time Tatum, known for playing romantic or heroic roles, played a cold-blooded killer... unless you count Public Enemies (2009)"", u'When Jody fires his gun up at Warren, he shouts, ""Say adi\xf3s to your huevos!"" which is Spanish for ""Say goodbye to your eggs!"" literally, or in slang, ""Say goodbye to your balls!"" This is also a reference to the scene in Inglourious Basterds (2009), where Sergeant Stiglitz says, ""Say auf Wiedersehen to your Nazi balls"", before shooting a Nazi officer in the groin.', u'In the earlier drafts of the script, the character of ""Charly"" was written to be a young orphan boy, whose parents were supposedly slaves, and were possibly murdered, thus making his demise at the hands of the ruthless Domergue gang much more depressing and tragic. His death scene was also originally supposed to be more brutal and violent. Quentin Tarantino allegedly scrapped the idea, and made Charly an adult character instead.', u""According to the earliest draft of the script, the scene where Major Warren interrogates Bob, Oswaldo, and Joe Gage about working with Daisy, and poisoning the coffee, was originally supposed to be more brutal and disturbing than what was shown on film. Instead of simply threatening to pour the rest of the poisoned coffee down Daisy's throat, Warren was written to violently beat her, hold her at gunpoint, and then prepares to shoot her in the head, until Joe Gage finally intervenes. This scene also had more dialogue."", u""There are many theories regarding the true authenticity of Major Marquis Warren's claims to General Sandy Smithers about the torture, assault, and death of his son. Many fans do agree that it is true that Warren did, in fact, kill his son, but actually did so in self-defense (since, after all, he had a bounty on his head from the entire South) and didn't torture him in the way he said he did. Warren may have very well embellished the story to anger Smithers enough, so he would try to pick up the gun and shoot him. Some fans speculate that Warren may have never even been responsible for the death of Smither's son at all, but simply made the entire story up to anger and enrage the General. Quentin Tarantino has obviously left viewers to make their own interpretations."", u'In one of the earlier drafts of the script, the character of Oswaldo Mobray, was written to appear entirely innocent until towards the climax. During the first major shoot-out between Jody and Mannix, an unarmed Oswaldo is shot in the chest by a panicking, trigger-happy Mannix, thus making the audience first speculate that he was merely an innocent bystander, with no connections to Daisy.', u'In the final scene, Warren and Daisy believe everyone to be dead. It\'s revealed that Chris is still alive, when he says, ""I ain\'t dead yet, you black bastard."" This is most definitely an homage to, and modified version of, the famous line ""I ain\'t dead yet, you bushwhacker"" uttered by Le Boeuf in True Grit (1969). Both lines reveal a character to be alive, who was previously thought dead, who ""saves the day"".', u'At the end of the movie, when Major Marquis Warren is tying off the noose to the bedpost, he ties what is known as a ""clove hitch."" This is a perfect application of this knot.

A subtle wink to repeat viewers that things are not what they seem inside Minnie's."", u'According to the first draft of the script, the character of Jody Domergue was originally written to be an older man with a huskier build, dark hair, and gritty features; a major contrast from the more slender-framed, youthful-looking, blue-eyed, and light-haired Channing Tatum.', u""This film has similarities to Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs (1992). In the latter, a group of men believe that there is a rat in the group. However in this film, there's more than one person scheming."", u'Quentin Tarantino: [characters with a high off-screen body count] General Sandy Smithers and John Ruth are notorious for having executed and killed many people, but neither of the two kills anyone on-screen.', u'The plot is very similar to Rawhide (1951), in which outlaws take over a stagecoach way station. In that movie, however, they are waiting for a gold shipment, instead of trying to free a prisoner.', u""Tim Roth's character Pete Hicox a.k.a. Oswaldo Mobray, dies with a bullet in the stomach, bleeding out, lying on the floor.

One example of this can be found in the English subtitles of characters speaking in a foreign language. Occasionally, the foreign word is inserted into the subtitle. For example, when Colonel Landa is speaking to the French farmer, he says ""Oui"" which is French for ""Yes"". Instead of the word ""Yes"" appearing in the subtitle, the word ""Oui"" appears, despite the fact that the rest of the French dialogue is translated to English.', u'At his audition in Berlin, Michael Fassbender inquired about playing Colonel Hans Landa.

He had already retired from acting, but agreed to play Winston Churchill in one scene."", u'At the movie premiere, Joseph Goebbels introduces Frederick Zoller to Emil Jannings (played by Hilmar Eichhorn), whom Goebbels calls ""the world\'s greatest actor."" Emil Jannings was a German-born star of silent movies. During the 1920s, he starred in several silent classics of German cinema directed by F.W. Murnau, including The Last Laugh (1922), and Faust (1926). In 1927, Jannings moved to Hollywood to star in American movies. In 1928, he became the very first winner of the Academy Award for Best Actor (and the first person to ever receive an Academy Award) for his work in The Way of All Flesh (1927), and The Last Command (1928). But his Hollywood career ended when talkies came in, as Jannings\' thick German accent made him difficult to understand. Jannings returned to Germany, where he co-starred with Marlene Dietrich in The Blue Angel (1930). During the Third Reich era, Jannings starred in numerous films intended to promote Nazism, including Der Herrscher (1937), Ohm Kr\xfcger (1941), and Bismarck\'s Dismissal (1942). Minister of Propoaganda Joseph Goebbels named Jannings as ""Artist of the State."" (In ""Inglourious Basterds,"" Goebbels has Jannings show Zoller the ring given for this award, which Goebbels calls ""the highest artistic honor that I give."") After the war, Jannings\' film career was ended due to his association with the Nazis.

Castellari\'s The Inglorious Bastards (1978), which is also about a group of American G.I.s wreaking havoc behind enemy lines, although the stories are wholly different in all other respects. (English Title: ""The Inglorious Bastards"". The Italian title literally translates as ""That Cursed Armored Train"".). Castellari returned the favor by calling his new movie Caribbean Basterds (2010).', u'There was a real unit known as ""Masters\' Bastards"" in World War II. Apart from the obvious rhyming, they earned the name due in part to their fearsome reputation against the Japanese, much like the fictional \'Basterds\' in Europe.', u'The large Nazi eagle displayed in the theater lobby is based on a bronze eagle that was in the Reichs Chancellery in Berlin, by Kurt Schmid-Ehmen.

In February, 1945, three O.S.S. agents - Frederick Mayer (a German-born American spy), Hans Wijnberg (a Dutch-born agent who, like Mayer, was Jewish), and Franz Weber (a former Austrian Wehrmacht officer) - were parachuted into Austria. For several months, Mayer gathered intelligence on the Germans\' ""Alpine Fortress,"" by posing as a Nazi officer and as a French electrician.

In regards to the safety of the car, his friend had said, ""Well, you could take any car and give it to a stunt team, and for ten thousand or fifteen thousand dollars, they can death-proof it for you."" The ""death proof"" phrase had stuck to Tarantino after that.', u'The film is meant to be an homage to the double features that played in grindhouses. However, during the initial weeks of release, exhibitors were reporting that many audience members were leaving the cinema after the first feature (""Planet Terror"" by Robert Rodriguez), apparently not realizing, or forgetting, that a second feature was going to be shown. One reason cited was that many of audience members were too young to remember when theaters showed double features. The distributor planned some changes in the campaign while some exhibitors solved the problem by posting employees by the auditorium doors to remind departing patrons that the program contains a second feature.', u'Eli Roth filmed the fake trailer for ""Thanksgiving"" in the Czech Republic while he was there directing Hostel: Part II (2007).

Tarantino owns a print of the Oliver Reed film The Sell-Out (1976) which when he bought it was missing a reel (containing a major plot point). After watching the film in this way, Tarantino found the scenes that he didn\'t see created an interesting mystery which made him try to figure out what went down in those scenes. Contrary to rumors, in the Grindhouse era, frames would often be missing from films but not entire twenty to thirty minute reels.

Most present day applicants are surprised to discover that the CSAs do not perform most of the tasks depicted on the series. For example, they do not interview suspects, they do not write or execute search warrants, and they do not make arrests. In real-life, they are directed around the scenes by the detectives and supervisors, not the other way around. Detectives are commissioned police officers (sworn personnel).

Grissom and Russell work with there CSI Partners Catherine Willows and Julie Finlay, respectively (both the equivalent of John Watson) whilst both working under the Las Vegas Police Department Homicide Captain Jim Brass (the equivalent of Inspector Lestrade).

Coincidentally, ""Paul Millander"" has the same initials as ""Professor Moriarty."" There\'s also a woman, Lady Heather Kessler, in whom he takes an unusual interest. Their relationship is similar to that of Irene Adler and Holmes. Both Irene and Lady Heather enchant Holmes and Grissom with their beauty, their wit and their resolution. Lady Heather often wears Victorian-style dresses, referencing Holmes\'s era (""Slaves of Las Vegas"", ""Lady Heather\'s Box,"" ""Pirates of the Third Reich,"" and ""The Good, the Bad, and the Dominatrix"").

As such it became the first to be subjected to the MPAA\'s new ""no blood"" policy for trailers, in which all sight of the bodily fluid must be alternately colored or removed entirely. This is why the trailers for this film (and similarly for every film released in the U.S. thereafter) feature The Bride\'s clothes covered in blackish-brown stains where the blood would be. Incidentally, the color of dried blood is blackish-brown, which means that the MPAA unknowingly made Tarantino change the color from fresh blood (red) to that of dried blood.', u'The members of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad are all named after snakes.

For instance, the Bride's face-off with Gogo Yubari (Chiaki Kuriyama) was influenced by the climatic scene from Chan's relatively mild romp Shanghai Noon. While, at least three notable references originate from Chan's 1976 film, Shaolin Wooden Men (1976): Pai Mai's introduction scene references the stairway and water training scene; Pai Mai himself though in white in Kill Bill is the blind orange master monk (who in Kill Bill blinds Elle); and, finally, the five point finger exploding hand technique comes from the end battle scene of Shaolin Wooden Men where the villain uses a special punch technique on the protagonists but is only able to deliver 4 of the 5 blows (with the protagonist holding his heart, as Bill does, right before dying).""]","[u'USA::29 September 2003 (Hollywood, California)\n (premiere)', u'Germany::1 October 2003 (Berlin)\n (premiere)', u'UK::2 October 2003 (London)\n (premiere)', u'USA::7 October 2003 (New York City, New York)\n (premiere)', u'Canada::10 October 2003', u'Czech Republic::10 October 2003', u'UK::10 October 2003 (London)', u'Slovakia::10 October 2003', u'USA::10 October 2003', u'Ireland::13 October 2003 (Cork International Film Festival)', u'Austria::16 October 2003', u'Australia::16 October 2003', u'Switzerland::16 October 2003 (German speaking region)', u'Germany::16 October 2003', u'Hong Kong::16 October 2003', u'Hungary::16 October 2003', u'New Zealand::16 October 2003', u'UK::17 October 2003', u'Ireland::17 October 2003', u'Iceland::17 October 2003', u'Poland::17 October 2003', u'Singapore::17 October 2003\n (premiere)', u'Norway::18 October 2003 (Bergen International Film Festival)', u'Japan::19 October 2003 (Tokyo)\n (premiere)', u'Singapore::23 October 2003', u'Denmark::24 October 2003', u'Finland::24 October 2003', u'Italy::24 October 2003', u'Norway::24 October 2003', u'Portugal::24 October 2003', u'Taiwan::24 October 2003', u'Japan::25 October 2003', u'Belgium::29 October 2003', u'Israel::30 October 2003', u'Spain::November 2003 (Sitges Film Festival)', u'Serbia::1 November 2003', u'France::4 November 2003 (Paris)\n (premiere)', u'Malta::5 November 2003', u'Colombia::14 November 2003', u'Sweden::14 November 2003 (Stockholm International Film Festival)', u'Venezuela::19 November 2003', u'Netherlands::20 November 2003', u'Greece::21 November 2003', u'South Korea::21 November 2003', u'Switzerland::26 November 2003 (French speaking region)', u'France::26 November 2003', u'Argentina::27 November 2003', u'Mexico::28 November 2003', u'Uruguay::28 November 2003', u'Sweden::3 December 2003', u'Russia::4 December 2003', u'Chile::5 December 2003', u'Panama::5 December 2003', u'Estonia::26 December 2003', u'Bahrain::31 December 2003', u'Egypt::31 December 2003', u'Turkey::2 January 2004', u'Philippines::14 January 2004', u'Kuwait::20 January 2004', u'Romania::30 January 2004', u'Spain::5 March 2004', u'Brazil::23 April 2004', u'France::28 April 2004 (re-release)', u'Bulgaria::1 October 2004', u'Croatia::11 December 2004', u'Indonesia::22 March 2005 (TV premiere)', u'Switzerland::8 August 2009 (Locarno Film Festival)', u'Sweden::7 November 2014 (Stockholm International Film Festival)', u'Chile::25 March 2015 (FEMCINE, Festival Cine de Mujeres)']",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Tarantino initially planned to film either Freaky Deaky or Killshot and have another director make Rum Punch, but changed his mind after re-reading Rum Punch, stating that he ""fell in love"" with the novel all over again.', u'The ""N"" word is said 38 times throughout the film.', u""When Ordell first meets Max Cherry in his office, clearly visible beyond Max's desk is a large poster for Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus for which Robert Forster's father, Robert Wallace Forster, Sr., once worked as an elephant trainer."", u'The film cast includes two Oscar winners: Robert De Niro and Quentin Tarantino; and three Oscar nominees: Samuel L. Jackson, Robert Forster, and Michael Keaton.', u'Another name on the tenant list for Melanie\'s apartment is ""J. Hill"", which is a nod to director Jack Hill. Hill directed and/or wrote some of Pam Grier\'s major roles.', u'The song playing during Jackie\'s arraignment is ""Long Time Woman"", performed by Pam Grier herself.', u'One name on the tenant list for Melanie\'s apartment building is ""S. Haig"", a reference to Sid Haig, who plays the judge that presides at Jackie\'s arraignment.', u""The inn, where Ordell and Louis have a drink, is called The Cockatoo Inn. The neon light letters t-o-o are out, so it spells The Cocka Inn: cocaine, a hint to the bags of cocaine found in Jackie's bag in the beginning of the movie."", u'The scene where Max and Jackie talk, and Max discusses that he had work done on his hair to make him look more youthful, was suggested by Robert Forster. Forster had such surgery when his hairline began to disappear and thought it fit the character. Tarantino was delighted that the actor was willing to openly discuss the procedure and immediately wrote it into the screenplay.', u'According to Quentin Tarantino, 70s actress Carol Speed originally helped out in making this film, and was willing to play a small cameo part in the film. At the last minute, Tarantino decided not to use her in the film.', u'Takes place during the summer of 1995.', u'Melanie watches a movie called The Mad Dog Killer (1977), starring Helmut Berger.

Bridget Fonda and Berger had previously starred together in The Godfather: Part III (1990).', u'Director Trademark: In the scene where Jackie and Sheronda are in the food court at the mall making the bag exchange, one of the cups on the table reads ""Acuna Boys"".     The Acuna Boys is the name of the gang that is run by Esteban Vihaio in Kill Bill: Volume 2 (2004).    The Acuna Boys are also Featured in Grind House (2007) in the form of an intermission advertisement.     The Acuna Boys are also featured again in Death Proof (2007), as the character of Arlene is seen sipping from a Acuna Boys soda.', u'During a scene, wherein Max Cherry is searching for a Delfonic\'s cassette tape in a record store, the song ""Letter to the Firm"" by hip-hop artist Foxy Brown can be heard blaring loudly on the store\'s PA system. Pam Grier (who portrayed the lead character Jackie Brown) is most known for her roles in several low budget ""blacksploitation"" films from the \'70s, particularly her starring role in Foxy Brown (1974).', u'When Jackie Brown (1997) premiered on terrestrial television in 2001, Radio Times\'s Andrew Collins had it as Film of the Week. Collins wrote in his review: ""The truth is it\'s his most mature film. It may lack the simplicity of Reservoir Dogs or the fireworks of Pulp Fiction, but it proves that Tarantino is a director who doesn\'t need violence to hold our attention."" Also unlike Dogs and Pulp, Jackie is told in chronological order.', u'The book Max Cherry is reading, when Jackie comes out of jail, is ""Berlin Game"" by Len Deighton.', u""Samuel L. Jackson appeared consecutively in three films adapted from authors' work in a year. These films are Jackie Brown (1997) and Out of Sight (1998), both adapted from books by Elmore Leonard - Jackie Brown was adapted from Rum Punch - and Sphere (1998) adapted from the book by Michael Crichton."", u'This is the second film to feature Robert De Niro and Samuel L. Jackson. They also appeared in Goodfellas (1990), but never shared a scene.', u""The films' title design is the same as Foxy Brown (1974)."", u""Contrary to popular belief, Tarantino's actual reason for changing the main character's name to Jackie Brown from Burke was due to his fandom of the Peter Yates film The Friends of Eddie Coyle, which features a flamboyant and cocky arms dealer named Jackie Brown, who's characteristics and behavior were the inspiration for both the book and film versions of Ordell Robbie. The author of Jackie Brown's source material Rum Punch, Elmore Leonard, was a noted George V. Higgins fan and claims him as one of his inspirations, Highins being the author of the book The Friends of Eddie Coyle."", u""Of Quentin Tarantino's films that have received Academy Award nominations, this is the only one to not win at least one award."", u'During the interrogation scene where Jackie is taken into custody - Detective Dargas stated that anyone in possession of over 10,000 dollars should declare it to U.S. Customs - this is based on the regulations coded by the Internal Revenue Service under Title 26 (tax code, enacted August 16, 1954 known as the Internal Revenue Code Act later amended in 1986 under the Tax Reform Act) and under Title 31 USC 5311 of the United States Code. It is against IRS regulations for an individual to carry over 10,000 dollars in currency (in this case, a cash transaction) without reporting it to U.S. Customs when entering the United States. This is further codified under Federal Law under 31 U.S.C. 5316 and Treasury Department regulations (31 CFR Chapter X) - individuals who enter the United States with over 10,000 dollars in cash (or other monetary instruments e.g. stocks, bonds), must file (after April 25,1990) a FinCEN 105 document. FinCEN is the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, which is a division of the Department of the Treasury.', u'Hugh Dillon auditioned for the part of Ray Nicolette.', u""This marks the first time that Quentin Tarantino hasn't had a cameo - if you don't count his answering machine greeting on Jackie Brown's (Pam Grier's) telephone - in one of the films he's written and directed. Tarantino had roles in Reservoir Dogs (1992) and Pulp Fiction (1994). Additionally, unlike the aforementioned films, this film has no prologue before the opening credits."", u""Although prominently billed on the poster and featured in the film's trailers, Robert Forster was excluded from most advance promotional photos for the film. He was the only actor in the cast to receive an Academy Award nomination."", u""Michael Keaton is not billed in the film's teaser trailer, although the rest of the cast is listed."", u'Two lots of the cast members - four in total - all have the same first names. They are Robert Forster and Robert De Niro, who play Max Cherry and Louis Gara respectively. Also Michael Keaton and Michael Bowen, who play Ray Nicolette and Mark Dargus respectively. Incidentally the Robert characters and the Michael characters are on opposite sides of the law.', u""Pam Grier's character's name is Jackie Brown. Quentin Tarantino played Mr. Brown in Reservoir Dogs (1992). So Grier and Tarantino have played characters with the same surname. Grier also played the main character in Foxy Brown (1974)."", u'In the scene when Robert Forster is walking out of the movie theater, there is a poster for Wolf (1994) on the wall.', u'Samuel L.

Jackson in Die Hard: With a Vengeance (1995) and De Niro in The Mission (1986).', u'Robert De Niro starred in The Godfather: Part ll (1974) and Bridget Fonda starred in The Godfather: Part lll (1990). Both films were directed by Francis Ford Coppola.', u'In an early scene, Ordell (Samuel L. Jackson) and Louis (Robert De Niro) go to visit a bail bondsman. Coincidentally, De Niro played a bounty hunter who worked for a bail bondsman in Midnight Run (1988).', u'Pam Grier, Samuel L. Jackson, and Robert De Niro have all co-starred with Sharon Stone. Grier in Above the Law (1988), Jackson in Sphere (1998) and De Niro in Casino (1995). Incidentally - if Above the Law had its alternate title ""Nico"" - then all three films would be one word titles.', u'Samuel L. Jackson and Robert De Niro have co-starred with Gwyneth Paltrow. Jackson in Hard Eight (1996) and De Niro in Great Expectations (1998).', u'Robert De Niro and Samuel L. Jackson have co-starred with David Caruso. De Niro in Mad Dog and Glory (1993), and Jackson in Kiss of Death (1995). Incidentally, Richard Price wrote the screenplays for both films.', u'Robert De Niro partakes in smoking pot with Bridget Fonda from her bong. In True Romance (1993) - also written by Quentin Tarantino - Brad Pitt smokes pot from his bong in one scene. De Niro and Pitt co-starred in Sleepers (1996), released the previous year to Jackie Brown (1997). Incidentally, Sleepers director Barry Levinson wrote the screenplay from pre-existing material, just like Tarantino did here.', u'Samuel L.

Jackson in Kiss of Death (1995), Fonda in Single White Female (1992) and Keaton in Desperate Measures (1998).', u""Robert De Niro and Samuel L.

They both also start with the letter 'S'."", u'Bridget Fonda starred in another Elmore Leonard adaptation, Touch (1997) released in the same year as Jackie Brown (1997). Like Quentin Tarantino, Paul Schrader wrote and directed his film. Incidentally, Robert De Niro starred in Taxi Driver (1976), also written by Schrader.', u'Trademark Tarantino snappy dialogue; when Ordell Robbie (Samuel L. Jackson) has learnt from Louis Gara (Robert De Niro) that he\'d seen Max Cherry (Robert Forster) in a department store. ""Max Ch-? You seen Max Cherry in the dress department... Man, look at me when I talk to you! You saw that motherfucker in the dress department when we\'re about to get a half million and you don\'t think nothing of it!"" What happened here was that Ordell started to talk to Louis, only to catch him looking out of the van window. This only served to dangerously enrage Ordell further.', u'Marks the second time director Quentin Tarantino and actor Samuel L.

In the fridge, there's a picture of Samuel L. Jackson naked inside a bath tub. This pic is from his role in Goodfellas (1990)."", u""Quentin Tarantino was criticized for excessive, exploitative violence in preceding hits like Reservoir Dogs (1992) and Pulp Fiction (1994), so his sarcastic response to critics in this film, was to tone down the blood and guts. When Melanie is shot by Louis, we don't see anything, and when Ordell kills Louis, we are behind the action, out of view of the bullet contact."", u'In this film, Robert De Niro has sex with Bridget Fonda. He also had sex with her aunt, Jane Fonda, in the film Stanley and Iris (1990). De Niro is the only actor to have had sex in a film with both the aunt and the niece.', u'Director trademark (black humor): after Louis shot Melanie in the parking lot, in the chest and stomach - as she was making fun of him for not remembering where he had parked the car - he turned to look down briefly at where Melanie lay dead. Louis then said, ""See? Just where I said it was"". He acted like nothing had happened, and drove off soon thereafter.', u'The scene where Robert De Niro shoots Bridget Fonda in the parking lot, is similar to a scene in True Romance (1993) - which was also written by Quentin Tarantino - where Christopher Walken shoots Dennis Hopper. De Niro and Walken had been severely provoked by Fonda and Hopper respectively in these scenes. Additionally De Niro and Walken co-starred in The Deer Hunter (1978).', u'When Louis Gara (Robert De Niro) and Ordell Robbie (Samuel L. Jackson) are talking in the van - before Ordell kills Louis - Ordell says ""Or"" a few times. ""Or"" could be seen as short for Ordell.', u'Notice when Ordell shoots Louis in the van, we see some blood, yet Louis doesn\'t even cry out in pain. Probably because he\'s so stunned at being shot. Then Ordell leans across and says, ""What the fuck happened to you, man? You aah-ss used to be beautiful!"" He then puts Louis out of his misery by firing a second shot, this time into his head and kills him.']","[u'USA::8 December 1997 (New York City, New York)\n (premiere)', u'USA::11 December 1997 (Westwood, California)\n (premiere)', u'USA::25 December 1997', u'Chile::1998', u'Peru::1998', u'Germany::17 February 1998 (Berlin International Film Festival)', u'Spain::23 February 1998', u'Australia::5 March 1998', u'UK::20 March 1998 (London)', u'Finland::27 March 1998', u'Italy::27 March 1998', u'Sweden::27 March 1998', u'Belgium::1 April 1998', u'France::1 April 1998', u'Denmark::3 April 1998', u'Israel::3 April 1998', u'Norway::3 April 1998', u'Iceland::8 April 1998', u'Singapore::9 April 1998', u'UK::10 April 1998', u'Ireland::10 April 1998', u'Germany::16 April 1998', u'Switzerland::24 April 1998 (German speaking region)', u'Portugal::24 April 1998 (Lisbon)', u'Japan::25 April 1998', u'South Africa::30 April 1998', u'Portugal::4 May 1998', u'South Korea::16 May 1998', u'Netherlands::20 May 1998', u'Brazil::22 May 1998', u'Turkey::22 May 1998', u'Estonia::12 June 1998', u'Greece::12 June 1998', u'Mexico::19 June 1998', u'Slovakia::16 July 1998', u'Argentina::20 August 1998', u'Uruguay::19 September 1998', u'Poland::20 November 1998', u'Portugal::26 February 1999 (Fantasporto Film Festival)', u'Hungary::25 March 1999', u'Thailand::26 November 1999', u'Brazil::30 April 2004 (re-release)', u'Czech Republic::30 March 2009 (Febio Film Festival)', u'Japan::7 June 2012 (Champs-\xc9lys\xe9es Film Festival)', u'Chile::28 March 2015 (FEMCINE, Festival Cine de Mujeres)', u'Ukraine::16 July 2017 (Odessa International Film Festival)']",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

As such, he found it very difficult to perform his part. However, Stone was delighted that when the film came out, Dangerfield's performance was hailed as one of the movie's strongest points."", u'Oliver Stone calls the frequent cuts to black and white, where dialogue is often repeated with a slightly different intonation, ""vertical cutting"". Stone explains that the idea behind the technique is to create an outer moment (the color footage) and an inner moment (the black and white footage) at the same time. For example, he explains this in relation to the waitress in the opening scene (O-Lan Jones), who while taking Mickey\'s order in the \'outer\' scene, is actually flirting with him (or thinking about flirting with him) in the \'inner\' scene. Also in the opening scene, when the cowboy (James Gammon) refers to Mallory as ""pussy"", there is a flash cut to Mickey covered in blood; this is Mickey\'s \'inner\' moment.', u'During filming, Oliver Stone would play African tribal music at full blast on the set, as a way of keeping a frantic mood.', u'The camera never angles on a straight, horizontal level throughout the whole film.', u""The color green is used to indicate the sickness in Mickey's mind and shows up prominently several times during the film: the key lime pie at the diner, the green neon at the drugstore, the green room in the prison."", u'The prison riot was filmed at Stateville Correctional Center in Joliet, Illinois. Eighty percent of the prisoners there, are there for violent crimes. For the first two of four weeks on location, the extras were actual inmates with rubber weapons. For the other two weeks, over 200 extras had to be brought in, because the Stateville inmates had been placed on lockdown.', u'Over 150 rattlesnakes, both real and fake, were used for the scene when Mickey and Mallory tread through the snake field. Initially there were concerns that the actors would being working too close to so many venomous snakes. But since the scene was filmed at night (when temperatures in the desert are significantly cooler), and since snakes (like all cold-blooded animals) are very sluggish in colder temperatures, most of the rattlesnakes slept through the filming of the scene.', u'In an infamous incident after the film had been released, Oliver Stone and Time Warner were sued by Patsy Byers, with the support of author and film producer John Grisham. In March 1995, 18-year-old Sarah Edmondson and her boyfriend Benjamin Darras (also 18) allegedly dropped acid and watched \'Natural Born Killers\'. Later that night, Sarah shot and paralyzed Byers, a store clerk in Ponchatoula, and Benjamin killed cotton gin manager William Savage in Hernando, Mississippi. John Grisham was a personal friend of Savage\'s, and after the murder, Grisham publicly accused Oliver Stone of being irresponsible in making the film, arguing that filmmakers should be held accountable for their work when it incites violent behavior. Byers decided to take legal action against Stone and the studio, and supported by Grisham, she used a ""product liability"" claim in the lawsuit, which argued that Stone had incited the teenagers to commit the crime. Initially, the case was dismissed in January 1997, on the grounds that filmmakers and production companies are protected by the First Amendment. However, in May 1998, the Intermediate Louisiana Court of Appeals overturned the lower court\'s decision, and the case went ahead. The attorneys for Byers\' attempted to prove that Stone and Warner were culpable in the murder and in Byers\' injury because they had purposefully meant to incite violence by ""distributing a film they knew, or should have known would cause and inspire people to commit crimes"". All of Hollywood eagerly awaited the outcome of the trial, because if Stone was found guilty, it would mean a drastic reexamination of the industry practices and would carry all kinds of far reaching implications as regards the content of movies. However, in a landmark decision, Byers\' action was thrown out of court in March 2001, and its dismissal was rubber-stamped by the Louisiana Court of Appeal in June 2002.', u'Took only 56 days to shoot.', u'When producers Jane Hamsher and Don Murphy first brought Quentin Tarantino\'s screenplay to Oliver Stone\'s attention, Stone\'s initial idea was to make a lighthearted all-action blockbuster. His previous film, Taivas ja maa (1993), had been a difficult shoot which had failed at the box office, and he saw \'Natural Born Killers\' as a way to make a fun movie and play with genre conventions. As he puts it himself in Chaos Rising: The Storm Around \'Natural Born Killers\' (2001), he planned to make ""something Arnold Schwarzenegger would be proud of."" As the project developed however, Stone found the movie getting deeper and deeper, and soon all hopes for a simple action spectacular were gone.', u""The film features Rodney Dangerfield's only dramatic performance."", u'Robert Downey, Jr. spent time with Australian television shock-king Steve Dunleavy to prepare for the role of Wayne Gale, and when he came back with an Australian accent, the filmmakers decided to go with it, and Gale became an Australian.', u'Oliver Stone has always maintained that the film is a satire on how serial killers are adored by the media for their horrific actions, and that those who claim the violence in the movie itself is a cause of societal violence have missed the point of the movie entirely.', u""When putting together the music for the film, Oliver Stone and soundtrack producer Trent Reznor both wanted to get Snoop Dogg involved, but Warner wouldn't allow it, as Dogg was on trial for murder at the time."", u""According to Oliver Stone, the use of television commercials was an attempt to illustrate the comforting power such commercials have. Every commercial comes after a horrific moment or a flash cut of a demon, and Stone's idea was that commercials work to soothe people after they have been exposed to something extreme."", u""In the mess hall in the prison, a bald white man is staring at a black man, prompting the black man to try to attack him, before being intercepted by Warden McClusky (Tommy Lee Jones). The bald man was a real prisoner, who had been convicted of murdering his wife and children by beating them to death with a lead pipe. Oliver Stone gave him a featured role, because he said the man's stoicism terrified him."", u'Michael Madsen was initially considered for the role of Mickey, but Warner Bros. wanted somebody less intimidating, and with a softer persona, as they felt this might alleviate the brutality of the character somewhat.', u'The story told on ""American Maniacs"" about Mickey killing a cop after asking him for directions is taken almost verbatim from a story made up by J. Edgar Hoover in the 1930s about bank robbers Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker to try to quash the public\'s growing favorable opinion of the pair. According to Hoover, Barrow approached an Oklahoma City officer, asked for directions and then blew his head off with a shotgun. The story fell apart, though, when questions were raised as to how, if the officer was alone when he was killed, Hoover could possibly have determined that it was Barrow who killed him, as there were no witnesses to the ""murder.""', u'Director of Photography Robert Richardson hated the script, and didn\'t want anything to do with the film, but Oliver Stone used their close friendship to persuade him to accept the job. For numerous reasons, Richardson called shooting the film a ""nightmare"" and one of the worst experiences of his life. The story brought up bad memories from his childhood, leading to insomnia, and a dependence on sleeping pills, throughout the entire shoot. During location scouting, his wife Monona Wali nearly died from an illness (and they later came close to divorcing because of the film). While filming a difficult scene, he broke his finger, and the replacement cameraman cut his eye. Near the end of shooting, his brother went into a coma. However, Richardson has said that all of these problems actually provided him with the creative energy he needed to shoot the film.', u'Oliver Stone wanted Juliette Lewis to bulk up for the role of Mallory so that she looked tougher, but Lewis refused, saying she wanted the character to look like a pushover, not like a female bodybuilder. In the end, Stone agreed, but he insisted she take kick-boxing lessons so that she looked credible when fighting.', u""After Quentin Tarantino had written the script, he promised his friend Rand Vossler, a fellow clerk at Video Archives, the director's chair. The pair couldn't find funding, and eventually decided to shoot it guerrilla-style (without permits) on the streets of Los Angeles, on black and white 16mm film stock. Shortly before production, Oliver Stone found the script and wanted to buy it. In exchange for giving up his directorial debut, Rand is credited as a co-producer."", u'Entertainment Weekly ranked the film as the 8th most controversial movie ever made.', u""Woody Harrelson, in an interview, spoke about the rape scene between Mickey and the hostage he takes. He expressed his hope that Oliver Stone had not added any additional footage of the controversial part into the Director's Cut. He was promptly told on camera that Stone had indeed done so."", u""Oliver Stone says that his biggest regret about the film is the fact that he had to cut out most of Pruitt Taylor Vince's performance as the prison guard Kavanaugh. As filmed, Kavanaugh becomes a comic character, who Mickey uses as a shield while moving through the prison, and who ends up being shot sixteen times by the time Mickey meets Warden McClusky (Tommy Lee Jones) at the stairs. In the finished version of the film, you don't actually see Kavanaugh being shot at all, prior to the stairs. Stone says he was forced to cut much of this, because the studio insisted that the movie be under two hours. Strangely however, the footage of Kavanaugh was not restored by Stone for his Director's Cut, nor was it included as a deleted scene on the DVD."", u'Steve Buscemi and Tim Roth were both offered the role of Wayne Gale, and turned it down.

For example, when Mallory drives past a building and flames are projected onto the wall, this was shot live using footage projected onto the fa\xe7ade of a real building.', u'Oliver Stone met with singer Tori Amos and openly offered her the part of Mallory. Early in her career Amos had been pursing acting as well as singing. She was interested, until he explained he also wanted to have her song ""Me and a Gun"" play during each scene where Mallory kills someone. The song is an a capella account of Amos\' real life rape. In response, Amos slapped him across the face and stormed out. Amos details this story in her autobiography ""All These Years"". She also references the incident in her hit song ""A Sorta Fairytale"", with the lyrics: ""Feel better with Oliver Stone until I almost smacked him; it seemed right that night.""', u'When Jack Scagnetti (Tom Sizemore) goes into Mallory\'s cell, and throughout this scene, you can read two different paragraphs above the door in the cell, and below Mallory, on the bedside. The one near the door reads: ""Come let\'s away / to prison we two / alone will sing / like birds in a cage."" This is from \'King Lear\', a play written by William Shakespeare, as Lear and his daughter Cordelia are being taken away to prison. The other paragraph reads: ""He is coming! He is coming! / Like a bridegroom from his room / Came the hero from his prison / To the scaffold and the doom."" These lines are from the poem ""The Execution Of Montrose"" by William Edmondstoune Aytoun.', u'Tom Sizemore plays Detective Jack Scagnetti in this film. The name ""Scagnetti"" was also mentioned as the name of Mr. Blonde\'s parole officer in Reservoir Dogs (1992), also written by Quentin Tarantino.', u'Robert Downey, Jr. and Tom Sizemore both later served time in prison, for drug-related offenses.', u'The title card for the film is an homage to Roger Corman.', u'The drug store scene was filmed in an Albuquerque building, that was a real drug store, that had closed just prior to filming. The original fixtures and pharmacy area were still in the store, making set up very easy. The sign above the door was added for the movie, and was still there several months after filming ended. The building is now a Hobby Lobby. 1,000 green fluorescent bulbs were used to light the scene.', u'Owen (Arliss Howard), the inmate that helps Mickey and Mallory out of the prison, is shown in the first scene. He is at a table reading a newspaper that reads ""666 death"". He is only shown for a second.

The Irish Film Centre, which is a membership club, and not subject to the same rules as public theaters, booked the film and had it scheduled to screen for a month long run in early 1995.

The BBFC however stood by their decision, so Warner Brothers took it upon themselves to withhold video release. Thus, when the film had its television premiere on the UK's channel 5 two years later, it became one of the few films to be broadcast on television, without having a video release beforehand."", u'Premiere voted this movie as one of ""The 25 Most Dangerous Movies"".', u'Gary Oldman and James Woods were considered for the role of Jack Scagnetti.', u'Rodney Dangerfield wrote all the ""filthy stuff"" his character said.

In particular, Stone was influenced by the famous death scene, which used innovative editing techniques provided by multiple cameras shooting from different angles at different speeds. Stone had used similar, although considerably more restrained, techniques in his previous two films, JFK - avoin tapaus (1991) and Taivas ja maa (1993), and would continue to employ these techniques for his next two films, Nixon (1995) and U-k\xe4\xe4nn\xf6s helvettiin (1997)."", u""The film was originally going to be shot in Panavision, as Oliver Stone's previous four films had been, but he decided that it should be framed in standard 1.85:1.

If they see red on a chicken in the flock, they gang together and peck at the bloody spot until the offending chicken is dead ... conversely, in that opening scene, once Mickey and Mallory saw red, they didn't stop until almost everyone was dead.

Calderon ended up with a small role, as Paul.', u'In an interview with James Lipton on Inside the Actors Studio (1994), John Travolta went into details of the many obstacles of tackling his role as Vincent Vega, the most challenging being that of how he was going to show the essence of his character as that of a heroin addict. Never using the drug himself, Quentin Tarantino had Travolta research his character\'s addiction by speaking to a recovering heroin addict that he (Quentin) knew personally. Travolta asked Tarantino\'s friend to tell him how could he know what it felt like to be on heroin (without actually using it of course). Tarantino\'s friend explained ""If you want to get the \'bottom envelope\' feeling of that, get plastered on Tequila, and lie down in a hot pool. Then you will have barely touched the feeling of what it might be like to be on heroin."" John Travolta then explained that he was ecstatic to tell his wife that he was ""told"" in order to research aspects of his upcoming roles\' character, he had to get plastered on Tequila and lie in a hot pool. He stated she happily joined him at the hotel hot tub which had shots of Tequila lined from end to end on the railings to assist him in his ""research"".', u'This film was selected for preservation in the Library of Congress National Film Registry.', u'The passage from the Bible that Jules has memorized was mostly made up by Quentin Tarantino and Samuel L. Jackson. The only part that\'s similar to what the Bible says is the part where he says, ""And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger. And you will know My name is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee."" However, the parts about the righteous man and the shepherd are not real. It\'s likely that Tarantino actually included it as a reference to the Sonny Chiba film Karate Kiba (1976) as the quote is almost word for word from the opening scene. Tarantino has also said that he is big fan of the actor and is therefore likely to have seen the movie.', u'Quentin Tarantino wrote ""The Wolf"" character specifically for Harvey Keitel.', u'The parts of ""Honey Bunny"" and ""Pumpkin"" were written specifically for Amanda Plummer and Tim Roth.', u""Jules flipping the table over in the beginning was improvised by Samuel L. Jackson, and Frank Whaley's reaction was genuine, but they continued with the scene, and it was done in one take."", u""The role of Vincent Vega was originally (and exclusively) written with Michael Madsen firmly in mind. Quentin Tarantino had been working on his script for seven months and, even though Madsen knew of Quentin's plans and had expressed his desire to play the part, Madsen had already signed up for the role of Virgil Earp in Wyatt Earp (1994), and was unable to commit to the film. He later regretted the decision."", u'Speculation abounds as to the nature of the mysterious glowing contents of the case (which Tarantino said was simply a MacGuffin plot device): Could it be Elvis\'s gold suit, seen worn by Val Kilmer (as Elvis) in True Romance (1993)?The most persistent theory is that it is Marcellus Wallace\'s soul. The story goes that when the Devil takes a person\'s soul, it is removed through the back of the head. When we see the back of Marcellus\'s head he has a Band-Aid covering the precise spot indicated by tradition for soul removal. Perhaps Marcellus sold his soul to the devil which would also explain why the combination to open the briefcase is 666.Quentin Tarantino has said that the band-aid on the back of Marsellus Wallace\'s neck had nothing to do with an allusion to the Devil stealing Marsellus\'s soul... but that the actor Ving Rhames had a scar on the back of his neck he wanted to cover up.According to Roger Avary, who co-wrote the script with Quentin Tarantino, the original plan was to have the briefcase contain diamonds (urban legend has it that they were the diamonds from Resevoir Dogs). This seemed neither exciting nor original, so Avary and Tarantino decided to have the briefcase\'s contents never appear on screen; this way each film-goer could mentally ""fill in the blank"" with whatever struck his or her imagination as best fitting the description ""so beautiful"". The orange light bulb (projecting shimmering light onto the actors\' faces) was a last-minute decision and added a completely unintended fantastic element. In a radio interview with Howard Stern in late 2003, Quentin Tarantino was asked by a caller the contents of the briefcase, and he answered, ""It\'s whatever the viewer wants it to be.""', u'Chandler Lindauer had to sit through the Captain Koons speech delivered by Christopher Walken. Because of his young age, he had no clue what Walken was saying, including the use of adult language.', u'When Vincent calls Lance on his cell phone, Lance is eating a bowl of Fruit Brute, a cereal from the older monster cereal family. Fruit Brute (which, along with Yummy Mummy, Frankenberry, Boo Berry, and Count Chocula, make up the monster cereals) was later discontinued, along with ""Yummy Mummy."" Quentin Tarantino has held onto a box and drops it into scenes from time to time. It appeared in Reservoir Dogs (1992), too.', u'Many people believe that the band-aid on Ving Rhames\' neck was an intentional choice by the filmmakers. In reality, it came from an accident Rhames had while shaving his head. When Quentin Tarantino noticed this, it inspired him to open the ""Vincent Vega and Marsellus Wallace"" sequence with a close-up of the band-aid instead. Ultimately Tarantino liked showing the band-aid rather than Rhames\' face because it accentuated the character\'s mercurial nature and was more visually exciting than a series of single shots of Rhames and Bruce Willis.', u""The dance that Vince (John Travolta) and Mia (Uma Thurman) perform at Jack Rabbit Slims was copied, movement by movement, from the dance performed early in Fellini's 1963 classic 8\xbd (1963) by Gloria Morin (Barbara Steele) and Mario Mezzabotta (Mario Pisu)."", u'The screenplay says that Zed and Maynard are brothers.', u'The role of Butch was originally supposed to be an up and coming boxer. Matt Dillon was in talks to play the role, but never committed. Quentin Tarantino then changed the role and offered it to Bruce Willis, who had been disappointed at not being signed to play Vincent.', u'The cab driver, Esmeralda Villalobos (Angela Jones), appeared in a thirty-minute short called Curdled (1991) in which she played a character who cleaned up after murders.

She bets Vincent that he is an ""Elvis"", and he confirms it. Tarantino says he removed the scene because of the film clich\xe9 of having one character film another with a handheld camera. It is also worth noting that Jules calls Pumpkin ""Ringo,"" as a reference to Ringo Starr, thus making him a Beatles person.', u'Vincent Vega is the only character who is present in every segment of the film: ""Vincent Vega and Marsellus Wallace\'s Wife"", ""The Gold Watch"", ""The Bonnie Situation"" and ""The Diner"".', u'The white 1980 Honda Civic which Butch is driving when he knocks down Marsellus Wallace is the same car as Jackie Brown later drove in the film Jackie Brown (1997) (1997).', u'Quentin Tarantino had originally intended ""My Sharona"" (by The Knack) to be played during the Gimp torture sequence, but the rights had already been licensed to another film, Reality Bites (1994). On top of this, one of the members of the band had become a born-again Christian, and did not want the song to be associated with a scene of sexual violence.', u'Quentin Tarantino is an avid collector of vintage television show board games.

Quentin Tarantino even had a spin off film in development titled the ""Vega Brothers"" which was a prequel to both movies. This film was scrapped, because both actors were too old to play younger versions of themselves.', u'The quote Jules uses is supposed to be from Ezekiel 25:17 in the Old Testament.

Buscemi duly complied.', u""During filming, a paramedic was kept on the set to make sure that Mr. Orange's (Tim Roth) amount of blood loss was kept consistent and realistic to that of a real gunshot victim."", u'Michael Madsen had difficulty filming the torture scenes due to his strong aversion to violence of any kind, and was particularly reluctant when he was required to hit actor Kirk Baltz. When Baltz ad-libbed a line that his character has a child at home, Madsen, who had just become a new father himself, was so disturbed by the idea of leaving a child fatherless that he almost couldn\'t finish the scene. This take made it into in the movie, and in some versions of the film, you can clearly hear someone, possibly Quentin Tarantino himself, utter ""Oh, no no!"" off-screen.', u'Tim Roth refused to read for the film.

Tarantino avoided telling Woods which role he was offered, ""because the actor who played the role was magnificent anyway."" It has been speculated that the role that Tarantino was referring to was Mr. Orange.', u'The title for the film came to Quentin Tarantino via a patron at the now-famous Video Archives. While working there, Tarantino would often recommend little-known titles to customers, and when he suggested Louis Malle\'s Au Revoir les Enfants (1987), the patron mockingly replied, ""I don\'t want to see no reservoir dogs!""

Tarantino and the producers were well aware that that plan might not have worked out at all.', u'According to Steve Buscemi in a recent podcast interview, everyone had a difficult time with Lawrence Tierney because he was easily distracted and kept forgetting his lines. Quentin Tarantino and everyone else were so upset with him that Quentin fired Lawrence on the third day of filming.', u'At the end of the breakfast scene you can see Quentin Tarantino raise his arm to end the scene. But the scene carries on anyway, this is because Lawrence Tierney had botched his lines over and over in previous takes. This was left in the final cut of the film.', u""At the very first screening of the film at Sundance, Quentin Tarantino stood up in the middle of the movie and told them to stop projecting, due to the fact that the entire film is shot in widescreen and the projector only had a normal-sized lens (not meant for widescreen), so half of whatever was shot wasn't up on screen."", u'In the commentary track on the True Romance (1993) DVD, Quentin Tarantino says that Tony Scott read both the ""True Romance"" and ""Reservoir Dogs"" scripts, and told Tarantino he wanted to direct ""Reservoir Dogs"".

These are appropriately in sync with the surnames of the characters in their present states. Mr. White and Mr. Pink are upright and close to each other, corresponding to the two shirt colors, while the orange rag laying in the distance would be the position of Mr. Orange in the next room.', u'Quentin Tarantino and his producer Lawrence Bender used to joke that they were the most inexperienced people on the set.', u'In Mr. White\'s flashback, Joe asks him about a girl named Alabama. This is a reference to Patricia Arquette\'s character from True Romance (1993). Quentin Tarantino has stated that he originally intended this character to meet up with Mr. White and to become partners in crime. When ""True Romance"" was released a year after this film, the ending was changed, and this backstory became inconsistent. Alabama never went on to meet up with Mr. White.', u'Quentin Tarantino wrote the first draft in three and a half weeks.', u""The opening conversation concerns a song by Madonna.

He was a novelist, and also played cons in other films -- Runaway Train (1985), The Longest Yard (2005), and Straight Time (1978) (which was based on his novel). In addition, he worked as a technical advisor on other films -- Heat (1995), for instance. Jon Voight's character in 'Heat' was based on Bunker."", u""The warehouse where the majority of the movie takes place was once a mortuary, and thus is full of caskets. Mr. Blonde doesn't sit down on a crate, it's actually an old hearse he perches on."", u'Kirk Baltz recalls that a more graphic version of the ear-cutting scene was filmed, involving a tube running up to his ear that squirted blood. Michael Madsen, however, has said he thought it was ""rather tame"", after seeing the scene play out that way.', u'Monte Hellman was originally tapped to direct the film, as Quentin Tarantino was a complete unknown. However, when Tarantino sold the screenplay for True Romance (1993) for $50,000, he lobbied hard to direct the film himself. Hellman took on an executive producer role instead.', u'The final answer print of the film came back from the lab just 3 days before its world premiere at Sundance.', u'WILHELM SCREAM: (at around 20 mins) The famous scream is heard when Mr. Pink pushes a pedestrian on the sidewalk while being pursued by cops during his escape from the failed jewel heist.', u'In the script, it was Mr. White who doesn\'t tip, not Mr. Pink. Also, it was Mr. Pink who had the first lines about ""Like a Virgin."" This was when Quentin Tarantino still intended to play Mr. Pink himself.', u'When Mr. Pink has his speech about not tipping, he mentions that he once worked for minimum wage. This might be a reference to Pulp Fiction (1994), where Steve Buscemi, the actor who plays Mr. Pink, is a waiter who serves Mia and Vincent.', u'The suit Harvey Keitel wears was his own. It had been a specially-made gift from French designer Agn\xe8s B..', u'The theatrical release of the film contains no female speaking parts. There are some in the 10th anniversary DVD, including Nina Siemaszko as McKlusky.', u'In the opening scene, when Mr. Pink is giving his tipping speech, he says when he orders coffee he wants his cup filled six times. Earlier in the film, when Chris Penn starts talking about ""The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia"", Mr. Pink can be seen about to take a sip from his cup before realizing it\'s empty. He then looks for the waitress.', u'Mr. Pink\'s numerous references to being ""professional"" are a reference to movie director Howard Hawks, a favorite of Quentin Tarantino\'s.', u'In the first scene of the Mr. Blonde chapter, when Vic Vega is meeting with Joe and Nice Guy Eddie, he states that his parole officer is Seymour Scagnetti. This character may be related to the character Jack Scagnetti, the detective in Natural Born Killers (1994), which was also scripted by Quentin Tarantino.', u'In the French version, the line ""If you fucking beat this prick long enough, he\'ll tell you he started the goddamn Chicago fire"" was translated into ""he\'ll tell you he blew the bridge over the River Kwai"".', u'Was voted the second greatest directorial debut of all time behind Citizen Kane (1941).', u'During a screening at Sitges Film Festival, fifteen people walked out, including Wes Craven and special makeup effects artist Rick Baker. Baker later told Quentin Tarantino to take the walkout as a ""compliment"" and explained that he found the violence unnerving because of its heightened sense of realism. Tarantino commented about it at the time: ""It happens at every single screening. For some people the violence, or the rudeness of the language, is a mountain they can\'t climb. That\'s OK. It\'s not their cup of tea. But I am affecting them. I wanted that scene to be disturbing.""', u""While driving in the car, someone mentions Pam Grier. She would later star in Quentin Tarantino's third film, Jackie Brown (1997)."", u'Kirk Baltz auditioned four times for the film.', u'Premiere voted this movie as one of ""The 25 Most Dangerous Movies"".', u'Ving Rhames was considered for the role of Holdaway.', u'David Duchovny auditioned for a part. According to Duchovny, Quentin Tarantino told him, ""I like what you do, I just don\'t know if I want you to do it in my movie.""', u'Of his decision to not show the heist itself, Quentin Tarantino has said that the reason was initially budgetary, but that he had always liked the idea of not showing it, and stuck with that idea in order to make the details of the heist ambiguous. He has said that the technique allows for the realization that the film is ""about other things""; a similar plot outline that appears in the stage play Glengarry Glen Ross (and its film adaptation) in which the mentioned robbery is never shown on camera. Tarantino has compared this to the work of a novelist, and has said that he wanted the film to be about something that is not seen, and that he wanted it to ""play with a real-time clock as opposed to a movie clock ticking"".', u'During the bathroom scene where Mr. White and Mr. Pink are discussing who is alive or dead, and specifically Mr. Blonde, there is a hint that Mr. Blonde is alive. Much like the white and pink shirts and the orange rag, the bathroom contains one other item hinting at a character. Behind Mr. White when he is doing his hair there is a yellow sink, suggesting Mr. Blonde is alive.', u'Jon Cryer was offered the role of Mr. Pink but he turned it down.

Hare reports that Keitel\'s character Mr. White and Madsen\'s Mr. Blonde illustrate the differences between the mental health diagnoses of sociopathy and psychopathy. Mr. White is a sociopath, a professional criminal who nonetheless has some loyalty and standards of conduct; he takes no pleasure in violence but regards the use of force as an occasional necessity in his vocation. In contrast, Mr. Blonde enjoys torturing the captured police officer; Mr. White explicitly describes Mr. Blonde as a ""psychopath"" and condemns his reckless shooting of civilians.', u""Both this film and Pulp Fiction (1994) have prologues featuring criminals at breakfast.

That role went to Bruce Willis, with whom Madsen later worked on Sin City (2005). Quentin Tarantino also worked with Willis two years later in Pulp Fiction (1994). Steve Buscemi also appears in Pulp Fiction, as a waiter who resembles Buddy Holly. He also worked with Willis on Armageddon (1998).', u'Seymour Cassel and Steve Buscemi went to the audition together.

This might be a nod to Quentin Tarantino\'s work with Lawrence Tierney in this film.', u'Oddly enough, in all the film\'s advertising, including posters and the theatrical trailer, Tim Roth is billed second while Michael Madsen receives the honorary ""and"" billing at the end of the roll call. However in the film itself, Madsen and Roth switch billings, as Madsen is now second, behind Harvey Keitel, and Roth with the ""and"" credit at the end.', u'Although Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth and Steve Buscemi all went on to appear in Quentin Tarantino\'s even more ambitious follow-up Pulp Fiction (1994), none of them shared a scene together.

Another offered $500,000 ... but only if his girlfriend could play Mr. Blonde.

The hilariously synthesized voice of \'Paul\', who narrates the text, says of Keitel selling shoes, ""But he didn\'t like the work. The mundanity and the monotony of it rapidly drove him wild"". In Reservoir Dogs (1992), Keitel, (as Mr. White), wears black shoes to match his suit. It\'s ironic that Keitel was a court sternograher, as this is part of law enforcement, given that he has a tendency to play criminals in his films quite often.', u'This is the second film where Michael Madsen tortures a man who is tied to a chair with a razorblade. The first was Kill Me Again (1989).', u""Cast members Lawrence Tierney and Lawrence Bender - also the film's producer - have the same first name."", u'Harvey Keitel and Chris Penn also co-starred in Imaginary Crimes (1994).

This is why anyone who smokes is smoking a pack of ""Red Apples"", a brand Tarantino made up. The exception in this movie is when Mr. White offers Mr. Pink a Chesterfield cigarette. (Additionally, any cereal in his films (Fruit Brute, Kabooom!, etc.) are all brands that died out in the 1970s and no longer exist.)', u'Quentin Tarantino: [long take] (at around 57 mins) While torturing the cop, we follow Mr. Blonde continuously from the warehouse to his car outside, back into the warehouse again.', u""Quentin Tarantino: [trunk] Before the audience sees the contents of Mr. Blonde's trunk, the camera looks up at Mr. White, Mr. Blonde, and Mr. Pink from inside the trunk."", u'The opening scene in the coffee shop contains subtle foreshadowing about the identity of the ""rat"". When Joe demands to know which crook didn\'t contribute to the tip, Mr. Orange is the one who snitches on Mr. Pink.', u'According to Quentin Tarantino, Mr. Pink does in fact survive. You can verify this by increasing the volume of the background sounds: When Mr. Pink runs out of the building with the diamonds, police officers can be heard shouting at him to put his hands on the ground. Gunshots can be heard, then Mr. Pink shouts that he has been shot. You can then hear the officers talking to each other as Pink is arrested.', u""Chris Penn's blood squibs accidentally went off too early in the big stand-off scene, forcing him to fall to the floor. There is not, as is commonly believed, a mystery round being fired off-screen."", u""The actress who plays the lady Mr. Orange shoots was Tim Roth's dialect coach. Roth insisted that she take the role, as she was very hard on him."", u'Although he supposedly killed more people than any of the other characters did, Mr. Blonde is never seen killing anyone on-screen.', u'In the scene where Nice Guy Eddie talks on his cell phone about the botched robbery, an orange balloon can be seen floating past the car. Some believe that this was intentional, as to foreshadow Mr. Orange as the rat. However, Quentin Tarantino claims that it was accidental.', u""According to cast member Edward Bunker, there was a scene that would have shown exactly what happened to his character, Mr. Blue but the scene was cut due to the limited budget. He also said actor Lawrence Tierney could never remember his lines, so Tierney's scenes took a while to shoot."", u'The promotional posters for ""Reservoir Dogs"" say ""Five strangers team up for the perfect crime..."". The criminals in the movie - Mr. Pink, Mr. White, Mr. Orange, Mr. Blonde, Mr. Brown and Mr. Blue - are in fact six strangers. It is possible it says 5 instead of 6 as Mr. Orange, being an undercover cop, would already know who the others are.', u'In the scene where Mr. Brown dies. Mr. White and Mr. Orange walk away from the car and as they are walking away you can see several crew members in the background behind a truck.', u'At the end of the scene where Mr. Orange is talking to the other undercover cop in Johnnies restaurant, they are talking about the comic character ""The Thing"" immediately after he says that it cuts to him in his apartment answering a phone. As he reaches to pick up the phone, he knocks over an action figure of Iron Man, and the action figure of the Thing is visible at the edge of the table.', u'The total death count in this film (onscreen and off) is at least 17. Four clerks in the jewelry store, five of the six crooks (Mr. White, Mr. Orange, Mr. Blonde, Mr. Blue, and Mr. Brown), Joe Cabot and his son Nice Guy Eddie, the two cops Mr. White shot, the cop in the trunk (Marvin Nash), the cop Mr. Pink shot, the woman Mr. Orange shot, and the ""black girl"" Mr. Blonde shoots in the bank. The number of police officers Mr. Blonde had to shoot to escape the jewelry store is not mentioned. It can be assumed that Mr. Pink is not shot after he flees the warehouse; although you hear gunshots, he can be heard very faintly yelling something to the effect of ""give up"" shortly thereafter.', u""When asked about Mr. Blue, Joe says that he is 'Dead as Dillinger.' Lawrence Tierney played the title character in Dillinger (1945)."", u'Many people have asked Quentin Tarantino why Mr. Orange confessed to being a cop to Mr. White at the end of the movie. They argued that he only had to keep quiet for 60 more seconds and he would be in the clear. He mentions this in the DVD commentary for the film. His response to these individuals is that they did not truly understand the movie, if they are asking this question. Tarantino says that in all the Asian countries that this movie was released in, this question was never once asked. He says that in Japan they have a word for this called ""jingi"". Without an English equivalent, it basically means that this was something that Mr. Orange HAD to do as a man. Something that he owed Mr. White. Furthermore, he could only do it in those 60 seconds, when Mr. White would have the opportunity to do whatever he deemed necessary.', u'When Mr. Pink is running from the cops, you can see a blue van with a window in the background, after Mr. Brown dies, Mr. White and Mr. Orange are walking away through an alley, the same blue van can be seen parked in the alley.', u'Supposedly Mr. Blonde and the character Vincent Vega from Pulp Fiction (1994) are brothers In a deleted scene of Pulp Fiction, Vincent Vega tells Mia Wallace that the singer, Suzanne Vega is his cousin and that makes Suzanne Vega Mr. Blondes cousin as well.', u'During the scene when Joe Cabot has given the men their false, colour-coded names, then Mr. Pink objects with, ""Oh why am I Mr. Pink?"" ""Because you\'re a faggot, alright?"" quips Tierney, causing Mr. Brown to laugh, watch Mr. Orange aka undercover cop Freddy Newendyke. In the ensuing argument between Cabot and Pink, Newendyke looks quite appprehensive, probably due to how angry Cabot gets with Pink. This foreshadows how angry Cabot gets with Newendyke at the end, when it\'s out in the open about him being the rat.', u'In a way Joe Cabot was speaking from experience when Mr. Pink said, ""Mr. Blue is dead?"" ""As dead as Dillinger"", Cabot replied. Lawrence Tierney played John Dillinger in Dillinger (1945). He also starred in a remake, Dillinger (1991).', u'Tim Roth gets gut shot and is cared for by Harvey Keitel. In Taxi Driver (1976), Sport, also played by Keitel, gets gut shot by Robert De Niro.', u'In the scene just before Joe Cabot gives the Reservoir Dogs their names, he says, ""All I want you guys to talk about if you have to, is what you\'re gonna do. That should do it"". While Joe is still speaking, the camera zooms in on Mr Orange, indicating in advance that he\'s the rat.', u""When Mr Orange has joined Nice Guy Eddie, Mr White and Mr Pink in the car, and Mr Orange, who in reality is an undercover cop called Freddy Newendyke and his fellow cops are following Eddie's car, there is an indication - no pun intended as cars are involved in this scene - that Mr Orange will rat on them, as in any instance where he isn't saying anything, he has a sly look on his face. It can only end badly for Mr Orange, as he soon gets in way over his head."", u'When a panicked Mr. Pink first arrives at the rendezvous point, he tells Mr. White that they were all set up and that there must be a rat within the group. Look carefully and you can see the injured Mr. Orange nervously produce his gun as though ready to shoot.']","[u'USA::21 January 1992 (Sundance Film Festival)', u'France::13 May 1992 (Cannes Film Festival)', u'Italy::21 June 1992 (Noir in Festival)', u'France::25 June 1992 (Avignon Film Festival)', u'Canada::September 1992 (Cinefest Sudbury International Film Festival)', u'France::2 September 1992', u'Switzerland::4 September 1992 (French speaking region)', u'Switzerland::4 September 1992 (German speaking region)', u'Germany::10 September 1992', u'Canada::16 September 1992 (Toronto International Film Festival)', u'Spain::October 1992 (Sitges Film Festival)', u'USA::October 1992 (Chicago International Film Festival)', u'USA::8 October 1992 (Los Angeles, California)\n (premiere)', u'Italy::9 October 1992', u'USA::12 October 1992 (New York City, New York)\n (premiere)', u'Spain::14 October 1992', u'USA::23 October 1992 (limited)', u'Brazil::29 October 1992 (S\xe3o Paulo International Film Festival)', u'Sweden::25 November 1992 (Stockholm International Film Festival)', u'UK::15 January 1993', u'Japan::February 1993 (Yubari International Fantastic Film Festival)', u'Portugal::February 1993 (Fantasporto Film Festival)', u'Sweden::26 February 1993', u'Belgium::March 1993 (Brussels International Festival of Fantasy Films)', u'Ireland::12 March 1993', u'Norway::29 April 1993', u'Turkey::May 1993', u'Portugal::14 May 1993', u'Denmark::17 May 1993', u'Brazil::4 June 1993', u'Finland::2 July 1993', u'Australia::30 July 1993', u'Netherlands::5 August 1993', u'Greece::1 November 1993', u'Hungary::12 May 1994 (video premiere)', u'UK::22 June 1994 (re-release)', u'Germany::30 June 1994 (re-release)', u'Argentina::1 September 1994', u'Uruguay::11 January 1995', u'Germany::29 June 1995 (re-release)', u'South Korea::23 March 1996', u'France::9 June 2004 (re-release)', u'Sweden::November 2004 (Stockholm International Film Festival)', u'Hungary::6 January 2005 (re-release)', u'France::September 2006 (Deauville Film Festival)', u'USA::2 June 2007 (Moonlit Matines Film Festival)', u'France::6 June 2007 (re-release)', u'Greece::14 October 2007 (Panorama of European Cinema)', u'Egypt::November 2007 (Cairo International Film Festival)', u'USA::19 June 2008 (P-Town Film Festival)', u'Italy::26 June 2012 (re-release)', u'UK::26 April 2014 (Sundance London Film Festival)', u'Taiwan::2 November 2017 (digitally restored version) (Kaohsiung Film Festival)']",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The soundtrack for the film features the song, along with the sounds of the wood being hammered into the door, and dialogue by Kurt Russell.', u'According to Quentin Tarantino his two primary cinematic influences on the film were The Thing (1982) and Reservoir Dogs (1992).', u'As of 2015, most theaters worldwide had their film projectors replaced with digital projectors, as traditional film stock was no longer in favor. As a fan and supporter of celluloid, Quentin Tarantino aggressively fought with distributors for the film to be shown in its original Ultra Panavision 70 presentation. As a result, 50 theaters internationally were retrofitted with anamorphic-lensed 70mm analogue film projectors, to display the film as he intended it to be seen. It was released on December 25, 2015, as a roadshow presentation, in 70mm analogue film format theaters exclusively, before being released in digital theaters on December 30, 2015.', u'Quentin Tarantino announced at Comic-Con in 2015 that Ennio Morricone would compose the score for the film. Tarantino remarked that it would be the first western scored by Morricone in forty years. He had previously used Morricone\'s music in Kill Bill: Vol. 2 (2004), Death Proof (2007), Inglourious Basterds (2009), and Django Unchained (2012). Morricone also wrote a brand-new song, ""Ancora Qui"", for the latter. Despite stories of tensions between the two, Tarantino decided to have Morricone on-board to compose original music for the movie, making it the first film by Tarantino to use mainly an original musical score. Most of his previous films have used mainly source music, with only a few cues of original score.', u'Despite being their sixth collaboration as actor and director, this is the first time that Samuel L. Jackson received top billing in a film directed by Quentin Tarantino.', u""Only the eleventh film to be shot in the Ultra Panavision 70mm process (65mm film with 1.25x squeeze anamorphic lenses, for an aspect ratio of 2.76:1).

This also makes it Quentin Tarantino's second film, after Jackie Brown (1997), to not be filmed in the 2.35:1 format."", u'There are three subtle references to Django Unchained (2012) in the film. First, when we meet Major Warren, he is sitting on top of three corpses and a saddle. This saddle was previously owned by Django, and the second is in Minnie\'s Haberdashery. Sitting on the floor of the haberdashery, is Django\'s green corduroy jacket. Both of these references have been confirmed by Samuel L. Jackson. Also, Walton Goggins\' character is called a ""hillbilly"" in both films. In fact, this film was going to feature Django, but Quentin Tarantino scrapped the idea. Samuel L. Jackson and Walton Goggins both have major roles in both films.', u'Composer Ennio Morricone had previously been quoted that he would never work with Quentin Tarantino after how his music was handled on Django Unchained (2012), but ultimately changed his mind, and agreed to score this film.', u'Unfortunately for the production, during the scheduled shooting dates on location in Telluride, Colorado, there was a long streak of nice weather. Large fans and starch, and large overhead sunblocks, were used in many of the outdoors blizzard shots to try to recreate a blizzard. A large amount of the much-needed snow melted away, and production was placed on hiatus. As a fun attempt to try to get more snow, many of the cast and crew members, including Quentin Tarantino, Samuel L. Jackson, and Kurt Russell participated in a local ""ski burn"", making an offering to the ""snow gods"" to try to get it to snow. Coincidentally--or, maybe not so coincidentally--a couple of days later, a big storm came in, and dumped enough snow to enable filming to continue.', u'According to Quentin Tarantino, this film was his metaphoric way of breaking down his feelings about The Thing (1982)--i.e., the way he felt watching it for the first time in a movie theater.', u'This film\'s 70mm roadshow version is a ""heavyweight"" in more ways than one. The analogue film is spooled on twenty reels, with a combined running time of 187 minutes, and weighs in at over 250 pounds.', u'At times, the cast and crew worked in a refrigerated set, in which the temperature was thirty degrees Fahrenheit (-1\xbaC).', u'The Weinstein Company spent eight to ten million dollars to find, procure, rebuild, and install 70mm analogue film projectors, and to train the 200 projectionists needed to operate them in the 96 U.S. theaters (80,000 dollars plus, per location) that showed the roadshow version of this film.', u'Pre-production was halted in early 2014 after the script was leaked online, Quentin Tarantino stated he would no longer shoot it as a movie, but would rewrite it, and release it as a novel instead.

Jackson, Kurt Russell, Tim Roth, and Michael Madsen in mind. The role of Daisy Domergue was less specific, and many actresses were considered before Jennifer Jason Leigh was cast. Quentin Tarantino said, ""Daisy became one of the most interesting characters, because she\'s on the page, but she\'s not on the page; an actress literally needs to invest in playing that character from beginning to end. They have to get you to that last chapter. It had to be an actress I could trust, and also a performer you enjoy watching her character work. When Jennifer came in, she was very impressive in the reading, but what really got me, was I\'d just started watching a bunch of her movies. I had a whole Jennifer Jason Leigh film festival. I watched one, and I couldn\'t wait to put the next one in, she was such an entertaining actress, especially about that time in the 90s, like eXistenZ (1999), Georgia (1995), and especially Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle (1994). Those movies were built around her. Her performance was the center of the movie, and everything was built around that, and that\'s what was needed for Daisy.""', u'Early test screenings had a runtime of over three hours, and included an intermission.', u'The name of the stagecoach line ""Butterfield Overland Stage"" is the same as in 3:10 to Yuma (1957).', u'The song Daisy Domergue sings when she plays the guitar is an Australian folk song called ""Jim Jones at Botany Bay"".', u'During the development stage, Christoph Waltz was rumored to be up for the executioner, but it was always intended for Tim Roth.', u'The Thing (1982) was the only film that Quentin Tarantino showed to the cast.', u'Quentin Tarantino explained in interviews, only after the film was released, that the very earliest concept of what became this story, was a sequel to Django Unchained (2012), he began as a novel called ""Django in White Hell"". However, he did not get far with the novel, before he realized that it didn\'t work to have a character whose morals were known to the audience beforehand, nor a character you felt was fairly sure to survive. Tarantino withheld this trivia from interviews, until after the film\'s release, because he was already contesting false reports that the movie would be a sequel to ""Django Unchained"", and didn\'t want to further muddle early public expectations. This is also why, in the wake of the script\'s leaking online, he was considering taking the story back to novel form, when he considered canceling production.', u'Viggo Mortensen was in talks for the character of Jody Domergue, but had to decline due to scheduling conflicts. Josh Brolin was rumored to have been up for a major role, but nothing came of it.', u'According to the written script, the characters of Minnie and Sweet Dave became acquainted with one another as slave and owner, before the Civil War. Sweet Dave once had Minnie as a slave, but they somehow stayed together after the abolition of slavery, for unknown reasons. It could be speculated that Sweet Dave was secretly in love with Minnie, or that he helped her purchase land to start her own business, as a way of paying her reparations for keeping her enslaved in the past. It is believed that Quentin Tarantino has left the audience to make up their own theories about the connection between Minnie and Sweet Dave.', u""Ennio Morricone said in an interview that he accepted Quentin Tarantino's request to score the film, because he liked the script, and because Tarantino gave him full freedom in the composition. Morricone said he considers the film an adventure movie, rather than a Western, and as a result, he tried to make the music sound completely different from his famous Western scores. He based the music on the feelings that the script evoked in him, rather than composing music for specific scenes. Because Morricone had only about a month to produce his score, he added several pieces of music that he had originally written for The Thing (1982), some of which had never been used. Morricone finally gave Tarantino five pieces of music, which he could use in the movie as he pleased."", u""The gory special effects were courtesy of The Walking Dead (2010)'s special effects guru Greg Nicotero, who also contributed to Quentin Tarantino's other films: Inglourious Basterds (2009), Kill Bill: Vol. 1 (2003), Kill Bill: Vol. 2 (2004), and Django Unchained (2012)."", u'Out of the featured cast, only Jennifer Jason Leigh, Demi\xe1n Bichir, Gene Jones, and Channing Tatum had not worked with Quentin Tarantino before.', u'All of the main events in this film take place in less than one day.', u'According to an October 12, 2015, ""Variety"" magazine interview with Quentin Tarantino, the 70mm roadshow cut of the film is 182 minutes long, making it his longest individual film (although the two parts of ""Kill Bill"" are 248 minutes combined). The version released in other formats, meanwhile, removed the twelve-minute overture and intermission, and six minutes designed for the spectacle of 70mm projection, reducing the length to a minute under Django Unchained (2012).', u'The name of Major Marquis Warren is a tribute to writer and director Charles Marquis Warren, who specialized in westerns (e.g., Little Big Horn (1951) and Arrowhead (1953)) and also contributed in excess of 250 articles of pulp fiction to various magazines.', u'Misty Upham originally had a part in Django Unchained (2012) as a character named ""Minny"" who owned the bar that Christoph Waltz and Jamie Foxx drink at in the film.

Both films also contain scenes of Kurt Russell disarming the other men out of distrust and paranoia.', u""DIRECTOR_TRADEMARK(Quentin Tarantino): [balls]: This is Tarantino's fourth (and third in a row) movie in where a character is shot in the testicles."", u'In earlier drafts of the script, the death of General Sanford Smithers was more graphic and brutal, than what was actually shown. Not only did Major Marquis Warren shoot the General, but the force of the bullet entering, sends the old man into the fireplace, where he burns to death. The only reason Warren lets the others pull his body out of the fire, is to keep the whole haberdashery from catching fire.', u""Takes place in the same universe as Quentin Tarantino's previous film, Django Unchained (2012), even though it is not a sequel. Ironically, Samuel L. Jackson and Walton Goggins play villains in that movie, and are the good guys in this one."", u""In the revised script, Jody's demise was less violent, and more sadistic than what happens in the film. In the script, he's shot once in the arm by Chris Mannix during the gun battle, and once in the back by Major Warren, after coming out of the basement to see Daisy. He then falls back into the basement and is left by Warren and Mannix to be eaten to death by rats taking shelter from the blizzard."", u'It is never actually proven, at any point during this film, to support Chris Mannix\'s claim that he was truly the ""new Sheriff of Red Rock."" While most fans agree that he was telling the truth, some speculate that he could have very well been lying. Quentin Tarantino has stated in an interview that he\'s allowed the audience to make up their own personal opinions about Mannix\'s authenticity.', u""In an interview with fellow filmmaker Christopher Nolan, Quentin Tarantino revealed that to come to the eventual neck-in-a-noose ending we see in the film, he wrote himself a private draft of the screenplay from Daisy's point of view, so as to acquaint himself enough with the character, thus justifying her dangling demise."", u""Somewhat atypical of a Quentin Tarantino film, there isn't any on-screen killing until 1 hour and 35 minutes into the movie. In the roadshow (70mm) screenings of the movie, the intermission took place immediately after this moment."", u'According to Quentin Tarantino, this film is inspired by the Western television shows Bonanza (1959), The Virginian (1962), and The High Chaparral (1967): ""Twice per season, those shows would have an episode where a bunch of outlaws would take the lead characters hostage. I love it in a Western, where you would pass halfway through the show to find out if they were good or bad guys, and they all had a past that was revealed. Just a bunch of nefarious guys in a room, all telling backstories that may or may not be true. Trap those guys together in a room with a blizzard outside, give them guns, and see what happens!""', u'In the original script, the fate of Major Marquis Warren was written almost entirely different. Jody, hiding underneath the floorboards, was supposed to keep shooting the Major over and over again, until he falls to the floor immobilized. Then a freed Daisy was to finish him off, by crawling across the floor, grabbing a nearby gun, and finally shooting him three times between the eyes.', u""At the end of the movie, when Daisy Domergue is hanged by Warren and Mannix, a pair of snowshoes is visible hanging on the wall in the background behind her, resembling a pair of angel's wings."", u""Despite the film's title and marketing, there are actually nine characters that share the cabin during the blizzard. Absent from the list of eight characters in the film's marketing is O.B., the wagon driver. There are ten, if you count Channing Tatum's character Jody, who is hiding under the floorboards. Tatum's character wasn't in any of the marketing trailers, because Tarantino, Tatum, and the whole cast wanted to keep it a secret."", u""At one point in the film, Tim Roth's character is shot in the stomach and bleeding out in a confined space with people around him questioning his loyalty, very similar to his character's arc from Reservoir Dogs (1992)."", u'In the original screenplay, the presence of rats in the basement, was a common occurrence in the haberdashery. Throughout the screenplay, the sound of rats fighting each other, occurs several times, and was often a topic of conversation. Also, Jody Domergue was not immediately shot dead after he came out of the basement. In the screenplay, he was shot but not killed, and the rats would eventually eat him alive. The rats were completely discarded, and were not in either of the movie versions.', u'Every one of the main eight characters (Warren, Ruth, Domergue, Mannix, Bob, Mobray, Gage, and General Smithers) is shot.', u""In the original script, the ending was written much differently than what was shown on screen. After Joe Gage reveals himself, as the man who poisoned the coffee, Mannix holds Gage at the table at gunpoint, and threatens to shoot him if he doesn't drink the rest of the coffee; Gage refuses. Warren calls out Bob, Oswaldo, and Joe Gage and suggest that they are all in cahoots with Daisy. Bob and Oswaldo draw out their guns; Mannix shoots Bob dead, and Warren shoots Oswaldo in the abdomen; he falls to the floor screaming in pain. This is the cue for Jody to act from underneath the floorboards; he shoots up at Warren's crotch. As Mannix is caught off-guard and distracted for a few seconds, Joe Gage draws his gun and shoots at both Warren and Mannix, hitting them both in the back. Warren and Mannix return fire and kill Joe Gage. Jody comes up from the basement and shoots Warren a second time; Warren falls to the floor immobilized. Jody and Mannix engage in a brutal gunfight, striking one another with several bullets until Jody falls back in the basement dead. Meanwhile, Daisy manages to free herself from John Ruth's handcuffs; she crawls across the floor, snatches one of Warren's pistols and shoots Warren three times in the head, finally killing him. She almost gets to Mannix with the pistol, when Mannix suddenly grabs John Ruth's Winchester gun and shoots her dead. Oswaldo stops moving and dies. Mannix, shocked and fatally wounded, drops the gun, limps over to Sweet Dave's chair, and waits to die alone as the roaring of the winter blizzard continues on from outside."", u'Body Count: Sixteen. However, it is brought to an even twenty, if Chester Charles Smithers, and the three bodies that Major Marquis Warren have with him, when hitching a ride with John ""The Hangman"" Ruth\'s stagecoach, are included.', u""Channing Tatum's casting as Jody Domergue, could be viewed as an homage by Quentin Tarantino to Sergio Leone's Once Upon a Time in the West (1968), where Leone cast Henry Fonda as the primary antagonist. At that time, Fonda had been known for playing heroic characters, and he accepted the role after Leone described Fonda's character gunning down a child, and how the audience would be shocked by the scene. This film marks the first time Tatum, known for playing romantic or heroic roles, played a cold-blooded killer... unless you count Public Enemies (2009)"", u'When Jody fires his gun up at Warren, he shouts, ""Say adi\xf3s to your huevos!"" which is Spanish for ""Say goodbye to your eggs!"" literally, or in slang, ""Say goodbye to your balls!"" This is also a reference to the scene in Inglourious Basterds (2009), where Sergeant Stiglitz says, ""Say auf Wiedersehen to your Nazi balls"", before shooting a Nazi officer in the groin.', u'In the earlier drafts of the script, the character of ""Charly"" was written to be a young orphan boy, whose parents were supposedly slaves, and were possibly murdered, thus making his demise at the hands of the ruthless Domergue gang much more depressing and tragic. His death scene was also originally supposed to be more brutal and violent. Quentin Tarantino allegedly scrapped the idea, and made Charly an adult character instead.', u""According to the earliest draft of the script, the scene where Major Warren interrogates Bob, Oswaldo, and Joe Gage about working with Daisy, and poisoning the coffee, was originally supposed to be more brutal and disturbing than what was shown on film. Instead of simply threatening to pour the rest of the poisoned coffee down Daisy's throat, Warren was written to violently beat her, hold her at gunpoint, and then prepares to shoot her in the head, until Joe Gage finally intervenes. This scene also had more dialogue."", u""There are many theories regarding the true authenticity of Major Marquis Warren's claims to General Sandy Smithers about the torture, assault, and death of his son. Many fans do agree that it is true that Warren did, in fact, kill his son, but actually did so in self-defense (since, after all, he had a bounty on his head from the entire South) and didn't torture him in the way he said he did. Warren may have very well embellished the story to anger Smithers enough, so he would try to pick up the gun and shoot him. Some fans speculate that Warren may have never even been responsible for the death of Smither's son at all, but simply made the entire story up to anger and enrage the General. Quentin Tarantino has obviously left viewers to make their own interpretations."", u'In one of the earlier drafts of the script, the character of Oswaldo Mobray, was written to appear entirely innocent until towards the climax. During the first major shoot-out between Jody and Mannix, an unarmed Oswaldo is shot in the chest by a panicking, trigger-happy Mannix, thus making the audience first speculate that he was merely an innocent bystander, with no connections to Daisy.', u'In the final scene, Warren and Daisy believe everyone to be dead. It\'s revealed that Chris is still alive, when he says, ""I ain\'t dead yet, you black bastard."" This is most definitely an homage to, and modified version of, the famous line ""I ain\'t dead yet, you bushwhacker"" uttered by Le Boeuf in True Grit (1969). Both lines reveal a character to be alive, who was previously thought dead, who ""saves the day"".', u'At the end of the movie, when Major Marquis Warren is tying off the noose to the bedpost, he ties what is known as a ""clove hitch."" This is a perfect application of this knot. It is often used to tie off tent stakes, or a boat to a pier.', u""DIRECTOR_TRADEMARK(Quentin Tarantino): [long monologue before a sudden violent eruption]: Major Marquis Warren's extensive account of him killing Chester Charles Smithers before he kills Smithers' father."", u'Although there was a cat in the cabin during the flashback massacre, it was not revealed what happened to the cat, but he obviously disappeared.', u""When Daisy and John Ruth enter Minnie's Habadashery for the first time, while they're nailing the door shut in the background, General Smithers looks directly at the camera several times. A subtle wink to repeat viewers that things are not what they seem inside Minnie's."", u'According to the first draft of the script, the character of Jody Domergue was originally written to be an older man with a huskier build, dark hair, and gritty features; a major contrast from the more slender-framed, youthful-looking, blue-eyed, and light-haired Channing Tatum.', u""This film has similarities to Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs (1992). In the latter, a group of men believe that there is a rat in the group. However in this film, there's more than one person scheming."", u'Quentin Tarantino: [characters with a high off-screen body count] General Sandy Smithers and John Ruth are notorious for having executed and killed many people, but neither of the two kills anyone on-screen.', u'The plot is very similar to Rawhide (1951), in which outlaws take over a stagecoach way station. In that movie, however, they are waiting for a gold shipment, instead of trying to free a prisoner.', u""Tim Roth's character Pete Hicox a.k.a. Oswaldo Mobray, dies with a bullet in the stomach, bleeding out, lying on the floor. At the beginning of Reservoir Dogs (1992), Roth's character is wounded in the same way, and spends several scenes bleeding similarly. He also provides significant plot reveals in both films once he's convinced himself that he will die. In Reservoir Dogs (1992), he is a good guy pretending to be bad, but here he is a bad guy pretending to be good."", u""Quentin Tarantino: [shot from the trunk] When Joe Gage tracks down the wounded Charly to a small shed, Charly's point of view from inside the shed is seen as soon as Gage opens the door."", u'Jody says to General Smithers, ""If my sister doesn\'t make it out of this mountain alive, neither do you."" They (Jody, Daisy, and Smithers) are all dead by the end of the movie.', u'In Spain, the ""Roadshow Experience"" version was only released in one theater (Barcelona), released in Ultra Panavision 70mm, and only in a Castilian-subtitled version.', u'Jennifer Jason Leigh and Tim Roth reunited in Twin Peaks (2017), once again playing criminal partners.

This segment was an accurate description for the character of ""Trinity"" from the 1970 spaghetti western They Call Me Trinity (1970) which this song was written for. This phrase was used due to the character\'s introduction of sleeping and being towed across the desert in a makeshift bed tied behind his horse.

One example of this can be found in the English subtitles of characters speaking in a foreign language. Occasionally, the foreign word is inserted into the subtitle. For example, when Colonel Landa is speaking to the French farmer, he says ""Oui"" which is French for ""Yes"". Instead of the word ""Yes"" appearing in the subtitle, the word ""Oui"" appears, despite the fact that the rest of the French dialogue is translated to English.', u'At his audition in Berlin, Michael Fassbender inquired about playing Colonel Hans Landa. Quentin Tarantino replied, ""Look, man, any guy that gets cast as Heathcliff is not fucking German enough to play my Landa, all right?""', u'Eli Roth put on 35 pounds of muscle to play Donnie Donowitz, ""The Bear Jew"".

This mirrors the role played by Diane Kruger: a famous actress turned double agent for the Allies during World War II."", u'Quentin Tarantino called Rod Taylor personally to offer him the role of Sir Winston Churchill.

Emil Jannings was a German-born star of silent movies. During the 1920s, he starred in several silent classics of German cinema directed by F.W. Murnau, including The Last Laugh (1922), and Faust (1926). In 1927, Jannings moved to Hollywood to star in American movies. In 1928, he became the very first winner of the Academy Award for Best Actor (and the first person to ever receive an Academy Award) for his work in The Way of All Flesh (1927), and The Last Command (1928). But his Hollywood career ended when talkies came in, as Jannings\' thick German accent made him difficult to understand. Jannings returned to Germany, where he co-starred with Marlene Dietrich in The Blue Angel (1930). During the Third Reich era, Jannings starred in numerous films intended to promote Nazism, including Der Herrscher (1937), Ohm Kr\xfcger (1941), and Bismarck\'s Dismissal (1942). Minister of Propoaganda Joseph Goebbels named Jannings as ""Artist of the State."" (In ""Inglourious Basterds,"" Goebbels has Jannings show Zoller the ring given for this award, which Goebbels calls ""the highest artistic honor that I give."")

(English Title: ""The Inglorious Bastards"". The Italian title literally translates as ""That Cursed Armored Train"".). Castellari returned the favor by calling his new movie Caribbean Basterds (2010).', u'There was a real unit known as ""Masters\' Bastards"" in World War II. Apart from the obvious rhyming, they earned the name due in part to their fearsome reputation against the Japanese, much like the fictional \'Basterds\' in Europe.', u'The large Nazi eagle displayed in the theater lobby is based on a bronze eagle that was in the Reichs Chancellery in Berlin, by Kurt Schmid-Ehmen. The original Berlin eagle is now in the U.S. Air Force Museum in Dayton, Ohio.', u'The character of Kliest is only present as a telephone voice, spoken by the German actor Christian Br\xfcckner.

However, Harvey denied this rumor, stating that Tarantino was reorganizing some scenes since he didn't have enough time to completely finish editing the film before sending it to Cannes, since he was given only six weeks to edit, whereas other directors are given normally six months to a year.

The title has the swastika removed and the steel helmet has a bullet hole instead of the Nazi symbol. The German site\'s download section was revised to exclude wallpaper downloads that openly feature the swastika. Though the advertisement posters and wallpapers may not show Nazi iconography, this does not apply to ""works of art"" according to German law, so the film itself is not censored in Germany.', u'None of the weapons used by the Basterds are American, befitting their status as a clandestine group of military assassins in occupied enemy territory. B.J.

This means he was in Africa 1942-43, during which time his conduct earned him the MC."", u'Although the movie is fiction, it was partially inspired by ""Operation Greenup,"" a real-life mission by the Office of Strategic Services. In February, 1945, three O.S.S. agents - Frederick Mayer (a German-born American spy), Hans Wijnberg (a Dutch-born agent who, like Mayer, was Jewish), and Franz Weber (a former Austrian Wehrmacht officer) - were parachuted into Austria. For several months, Mayer gathered intelligence on the Germans\' ""Alpine Fortress,"" by posing as a Nazi officer and as a French electrician. While staying with Weber\'s family in Innsbruck, Wijnberg and Weber radioed the intelligence back to OSS operatives in Bari, Italy. When Mayer\'s cover was blown by a black marketer, he was captured and tortured by the Gestapo, but refused to give up the other two agents. However, General Franz Hofer, commander of the Nazi forces in western Austria, realized the war was lost and was looking for a way to surrender his forces to the Allies, instead of to the Red Army. He had Mayer brought to his home, and offered to send a message for him to the O.S.S. offices in Bern, Switzerland, through a German agent. Mayer helped negotiate the surrender of Germany\'s Austria forces, which took place in Innsbruck on May 3, 1945. Afterwards, Mayer and Wijnberg returned to America.

Fearing that actor Christoph Waltz would choke her too much or too little, Tarantino decided to literally take matters into his own hands and did the scene himself.

Roth and Doom were treated for minor burns.', u""In the original ending, Shosanna's movie for the Nazis was supposed to be in French. M\xe9lanie Laurent was the one who suggested to Quentin Tarantino it should be done in English to make the finale more powerful."", u""The scar on Aldo Raine's neck is never explained. The script hints that Raine survived a lynching, a common punishment in the 1920s and 1930s, but otherwise, it explicitly states that the scar will never be explained."", u'Quentin Tarantino had all of the actors playing the Basterds go through a day of ""scalping training"" in preparation for the movie, and told them that the three best practice scalpers would be rewarded with close-ups of them doing just that in the film. One of these moments comes in the very last scene, when Private First Class Utivich scalps Landa\'s driver after Aldo shoots him.', u'Despite his reputation and being leader of the Basterds, Aldo Raine is only seen killing one person on-screen (At the end when he shoots the radio operator).', u'The giant swastika falling down in the final scene is real. It was a mistake that happened on the set.', u'In earlier drafts of the screenplay, Shosanna was a much more active member of the French resistance, sniping at soldiers from rooftops, and even compiling a death list of high ranking Nazi officials to cross off. But when Quentin Tarantino did his ""Kill Bill"" movies, he worked those plot details into that story, and decided it was redundant, so instead, he decided to make Shosanna a more realistic character, and have her keep a low profile.', u""Chapter Three is the only chapter throughout the movie where someone doesn't die, and the only chapter where English is not spoken."", u""The shooting script includes a scene where Raine and his men intimidate the veterinarian into treating Bridget Von Hammersmark's bullet wound by shooting two of the dogs inside their cages. This scene was apparently filmed but cut from the final print, as during the scene with Hammersmark on the table if you look behind her you can see two cages with holes in the wire mesh, blood stains, and dead dogs within."", u'In the original draft of the script, Wilhelm survives being shot by Bridget von Hammersmark, and it is his information provided to Colonel Hans Landa that blows her cover.', u""In the original script Samm Levine's role was much larger, with Private First Class Hirschberg being one of the primary members of the Basterds. However, in the film, Hirschberg only speaks one line, and he disappears before the closing scenes with his fate being left unresolved. In interviews, Samm Levine confirms that Hirschberg survives to the story's end, and written-but-not-filmed closing scenes had him, and other unspecified Basterds, meeting up with Lieutenant Raine and Private First Class Utivich after they settled things with Colonel Landa."", u'The scene with Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz ) placing the high-heeled shoe on Bridget von Hammersmark\'s (Diane Kruger ) foot is a twisted reference to the fairy tale ""Cinderella"". In the story, the prince identifies Cinderella by making her try on the glass slipper she lost at the ball. Here, Landa identifies von Hammersmark as the double-agent by making her try on the heel she lost in the bar-fight.', u""The standoff between Aldo and Sergeant Wilhelm during the LaLouisiane scene is similar to a scene in Quentin Tarantino's other movie Kill Bill: Vol. 2 (2004) in which The Bride just finds out she is pregnant and is attacked by a hit woman. The two have a standoff in which she makes a deal with the hit woman to let her go as she is pregnant. Sergeant Wilhelm makes a deal with Aldo to let him go as he had become a father that night. The difference in the two scenarios is that The Bride honors the deal and the hitwoman escapes, while Aldo honors the deal but Bridget von Hammersmark shoots and kills Sergeant Wilhelm."", u'Quentin Tarantino continues his tradition of ripping on waiters in this film, by killing the French barmaid in the LaLouisiane tavern shoot-out. (Only two waiters are on screen in the film, the barmaid being the only one featured exclusively.)', u'Despite the similarity between the small role of Harvey Keitel in this film, and his role in Pulp Fiction (1994), Eli Roth confirmed that his character is not ""The Wolf"" in this film. He jokingly added that Samuel L. Jackson does not narrate under the guise of Jules Winfield.', u""Similarity between the movie and the movie-within-the-movie: Both have foreign language dialogues displayed as translated subtitles. In case of the movie-within-the-movie (Nation's Pride), this is seen when Private Fredrick Zoller's character speaks in English (subtitles displayed in German on the Cinema's screen) just before Shosanna Dreyfus overrides the movie with her message."", u""During the restaurant scene when Emmanuelle Mimieux (A.K.A. Shosanna Dreyfus) hears the name Colonel Hans Landa, the man who killed her family in front of her four years prior, and realizes that he is, in fact, standing behind her, the pounding sound effect playing over the scene is an excerpt from Charles Bernstein's score from the 1982 film, The Entity."", u'Marks the fourth time director Quentin Tarantino and actor Samuel L.

They would contract a big-name movie star to appear in their movie for one day, for a few frontal shots only, while the rest of the scenes were done with a double filmed from the back.

Rodriguez shot and Quentin Tarantino directed the tape, which was shot using a 950,000 dollar digital camera. Marley Shelton, who was playing Brolin's character's wife in Grindhouse, agreed to read the lines for Llewelyn's wife Carla Jean (eventually played by Kelly Macdonald)."", u'Robert Rodriguez first came up with the idea for Planet Terror while making The Faculty (1998). He told Elijah Wood and Josh Hartnett that zombie movies were about to come back in a major way. He wanted to be there first when it happened so he prepared a script. But he only got as far as 30 pages before he got stuck for ideas. And when he got attached to other projects, the zombie craze happened just as he predicted. Rodriguez later commented, ""I knew I should\'ve made my zombie movie.""', u'Deputy Tolo is a terrible shot - he keeps missing his targets through the movie.

Tarantino owns a print of the Oliver Reed film The Sell-Out (1976) which when he bought it was missing a reel (containing a major plot point). After watching the film in this way, Tarantino found the scenes that he didn\'t see created an interesting mystery which made him try to figure out what went down in those scenes. Contrary to rumors, in the Grindhouse era, frames would often be missing from films but not entire twenty to thirty minute reels.

First, was as Unruly Julie in My Best Friend\'s Birthday (1987), she\'s mentioned as a rival DJ to Clarence. Second, as Wayne Gale\'s assistant in Natural Born Killers (1994). Third, as a DJ in Death Proof (2007).', u'The cheerleader costume worn by Mary Elizabeth Winstead in Death Proof (2007) says ""Vipers"", an homage to the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad (DiVAS) in ""Kill Bill"".

(2003), that he played one of the zombies that attacked Tammy (Fergie).', u'In order to give the cast and crew an idea of how a double feature grindhouse movie would feel, Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino compiled together the Italian films: Torso (1973) and Zombie (1979), with a few old grindhouse trailers in between.', u'""The poem that Jungle Julia has her listeners recite to Butterfly is an excerpt of the poem ""Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening"" by Robert Frost."" - it is also a reference to the thriller Telefon (1977),"" where the poem was used as a posthypnotic signal to activate Russian sleeper agents.', u'In the uncut European version of Death Proof (2007), Kim says she has to pee while at a liquor store.

This is an obvious reference to both ""Kill Bill"" and Jasmine Yuen Carrucan.', u'Daryl Hannah (Elle Driver) owns the car (a 1980 Pontiac Trans-Am) her character drives in the film. However, she owns the one that was used for promotional shots, because Michael Madsen (Budd) got the working Trans-Am before she got to it.', u""The spit-can that Budd (Michael Madsen) uses, is labeled Oak Ridge Coffee.

This is not a real book; the book functions not only as a prop but as an inside joke. It\'s a tribute to a member of the film crew, \'Jasmine Yuen Carrucan\'. Kurrajong is a town in Australia - Jasmine Yuen Carrucan is Australian. In other words, the Carrucans who live in Kurrajong (the native aboriginal name for a town). Kurrajong is located in the far north west of Sydney between Palm Beach and the Blue Mountains (near Richmond). Kurrajong is a species of bottle tree native to Australia and New Guineas as well as New Zealand from 50m years ago.

In the final film, however, Beatrix Kiddo leaves Elle Driver alive."", u'It is a common fan theory that Samuel L. Jackson\'s character of Rufus, the piano playing drifter, is actually Jules Winfield, from Pulp Fiction (1994). At the end of Pulp Fiction, Jules says he wants to ""Become a drifter, and walk the earth."" In Kill Bill Vol. 2, Rufus at one point says ""I was a drifter..."" while telling his story in the church. However, there is no proof to this theory, because when Rufus says ""I was a drifter,"" he also says ""I was a Coaster, and I was a Temptation. If they came through Texas, I played with them,"" inferring that he played back-up for the bands The Drifters, The Coasters, and The Temptations."" Whether or not Rufus is actually Jules Winfield, telling tall tales, only Tarantino knows for sure.', u'Throughout both parts, Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) and Budd (Michael Madsen) are the only fellow assassins that Beatrix Kiddo does not cite as having ""unfinished business"" with her. She kills neither.', u""The climax of the film was originally written as a sword-fight on the beach, under the moonlight, between Beatrix (clad in her wedding dress) and Bill.

Her name is actually spoken or revealed on more than one occasion. When someone calls her Beatrix and it\'s bleeped, it is simply muffled and is still audible, and if you\'re good at reading lips, you may be able to figure it out. Also, Bill refers to The Bride as ""Kiddo"" in the flashback scenes. While this is both his pet name for her, and a common term of endearment, it is also her last name.', u'During the scene, in which Bill shoots the bride with truth serum, and then interrogates her, he calls her a ""natural born killer"" and also a ""renegade killer bee,"" which references projects of the Wu-Tang Clan, a member of which (RZA) wrote much of the original music for the two films.', u'In the original script, the fight between Beatrix Kiddo and Elle Driver was supposed to resemble her fight with O-Ren Ishii. Quentin Tarantino revealed in an interview with Entertainment Weekly that he changed it the day after catching a showing of Jackass: The Movie (2002) at the Alamo Drafthouse in Austin, Texas.', u'During the end credits, the names of actors and actresses playing characters on The Bride\'s ""Death List Five"" list are crossed off, that is, those characters who die on-screen. In order, as per the ""Death List Five"", it is Lucy Liu (O-Ren Ishii), Vivica A. Fox (Vernita Green), and Michael Madsen (Budd). However, a question mark appears over Daryl Hannah (Elle), since it is technically unknown as to her condition, though, being now completely blind, heavily bleeding from her (second) destroyed eye, and being in the middle of the desert, she has very little, or no, hope to survive. David Carradine (Bill), who dies on-screen, has his name appear before the aforementioned cast members, yet his name is not crossed off.', u""In an interview, Quentin Tarantino stated that there will be a Kill Bill: Vol 3, but it wouldn't happen for a decade, and he also discussed the possibility of a spin-off centering around Vernita Green's daughter Nikki, who seeks vengeance upon The Bride. The plot of Kill Bill: Vol 3 could possibly be about The Bride, who is forced to return to her former violent life, when Nikki Green kidnaps her daughter BB, in order to lure The Bride into a deadly trap, and The Bride learns Nikki is not acting alone, and is working with Elle Driver, now a blind swordswoman."", u'Esteban Vihaio (Michael Parks) explains to Beatrix, that Bill is passionate about blonde women, after seeing Lana Turner in The Postman Always Rings Twice (1946), that he saw with Vihaio when he was six years old. According to this, Bill is 64 years old during the events of the movie.', u'Before Chapter Six was changed from ""Can She Bake a Cherry Pie?"" to ""Massacre at Two Pines"", Samuel L.

O\'Boyle, a casino owner, whom Bill personally dispatches, after toying with her.', u'The scene in which Budd opens the case to reveal a black mamba, that bites him in the face, was inspired by, and borrowed from, Venom (1981), in which Susan George opens a crate containing a black mamba that bites her in the face.', u'The Bride using a method that kills Bill 5 paces after being struck is a symbolic reference to her Black Mamba namesake the bite of which is sometimes claimed to be able kill a victim within 5 pace of being bitten.', u'During the scene toward the end of the film where Bill and Beatrix are talking in the living room, Bill refers to her as a ""natural born killer"" Quentin Tarantino wrote the story for the Oliver Stone film Natural Born Killers (1994).', u""In the scene where Uma Thurman is taking the pregnancy test, she consults a watch.

They also appeared in Goodfellas (1990), but never shared a scene.', u""The films' title design is the same as Foxy Brown (1974)."", u""Contrary to popular belief, Tarantino's actual reason for changing the main character's name to Jackie Brown from Burke was due to his fandom of the Peter Yates film The Friends of Eddie Coyle, which features a flamboyant and cocky arms dealer named Jackie Brown, who's characteristics and behavior were the inspiration for both the book and film versions of Ordell Robbie. The author of Jackie Brown's source material Rum Punch, Elmore Leonard, was a noted George V. Higgins fan and claims him as one of his inspirations, Highins being the author of the book The Friends of Eddie Coyle."", u""Of Quentin Tarantino's films that have received Academy Award nominations, this is the only one to not win at least one award."", u'During the interrogation scene where Jackie is taken into custody - Detective Dargas stated that anyone in possession of over 10,000 dollars should declare it to U.S. Customs - this is based on the regulations coded by the Internal Revenue Service under Title 26 (tax code, enacted August 16, 1954 known as the Internal Revenue Code Act later amended in 1986 under the Tax Reform Act) and under Title 31 USC 5311 of the United States Code. It is against IRS regulations for an individual to carry over 10,000 dollars in currency (in this case, a cash transaction) without reporting it to U.S. Customs when entering the United States. This is further codified under Federal Law under 31 U.S.C. 5316 and Treasury Department regulations (31 CFR Chapter X) - individuals who enter the United States with over 10,000 dollars in cash (or other monetary instruments e.g. stocks, bonds), must file (after April 25,1990) a FinCEN 105 document. FinCEN is the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, which is a division of the Department of the Treasury.', u'Hugh Dillon auditioned for the part of Ray Nicolette.', u""This marks the first time that Quentin Tarantino hasn't had a cameo - if you don't count his answering machine greeting on Jackie Brown's (Pam Grier's) telephone - in one of the films he's written and directed. Tarantino had roles in Reservoir Dogs (1992) and Pulp Fiction (1994). Additionally, unlike the aforementioned films, this film has no prologue before the opening credits."", u""Although prominently billed on the poster and featured in the film's trailers, Robert Forster was excluded from most advance promotional photos for the film. He was the only actor in the cast to receive an Academy Award nomination."", u""Michael Keaton is not billed in the film's teaser trailer, although the rest of the cast is listed."", u'Two lots of the cast members - four in total - all have the same first names. They are Robert Forster and Robert De Niro, who play Max Cherry and Louis Gara respectively. Also Michael Keaton and Michael Bowen, who play Ray Nicolette and Mark Dargus respectively. Incidentally the Robert characters and the Michael characters are on opposite sides of the law.', u""Pam Grier's character's name is Jackie Brown. Quentin Tarantino played Mr. Brown in Reservoir Dogs (1992). So Grier and Tarantino have played characters with the same surname. Grier also played the main character in Foxy Brown (1974)."", u'In the scene when Robert Forster is walking out of the movie theater, there is a poster for Wolf (1994) on the wall.', u'Samuel L. Jackson and Robert De Niro have co-starred in films with Jeremy Irons. Jackson in Die Hard: With a Vengeance (1995) and De Niro in The Mission (1986).', u'Robert De Niro starred in The Godfather: Part ll (1974) and Bridget Fonda starred in The Godfather: Part lll (1990). Both films were directed by Francis Ford Coppola.', u'In an early scene, Ordell (Samuel L. Jackson) and Louis (Robert De Niro) go to visit a bail bondsman. Coincidentally, De Niro played a bounty hunter who worked for a bail bondsman in Midnight Run (1988).', u'Pam Grier, Samuel L. Jackson, and Robert De Niro have all co-starred with Sharon Stone. Grier in Above the Law (1988), Jackson in Sphere (1998) and De Niro in Casino (1995). Incidentally - if Above the Law had its alternate title ""Nico"" - then all three films would be one word titles.', u'Samuel L. Jackson and Robert De Niro have co-starred with Gwyneth Paltrow. Jackson in Hard Eight (1996) and De Niro in Great Expectations (1998).', u'Robert De Niro and Samuel L. Jackson have co-starred with David Caruso. De Niro in Mad Dog and Glory (1993), and Jackson in Kiss of Death (1995). Incidentally, Richard Price wrote the screenplays for both films.', u'Robert De Niro partakes in smoking pot with Bridget Fonda from her bong. In True Romance (1993) - also written by Quentin Tarantino - Brad Pitt smokes pot from his bong in one scene. De Niro and Pitt co-starred in Sleepers (1996), released the previous year to Jackie Brown (1997). Incidentally, Sleepers director Barry Levinson wrote the screenplay from pre-existing material, just like Tarantino did here.', u'Samuel L. Jackson, Bridget Fonda, and Michael Keaton have all starred in films directed by Barbet Schroeder. Jackson in Kiss of Death (1995), Fonda in Single White Female (1992) and Keaton in Desperate Measures (1998).', u""Robert De Niro and Samuel L. Jackson were both in films directed by Barry Levinson, their first collaborations were Sleepers (1996) and Sphere (1998) respectively. Incidentally both films are based on books of the same name, written by Lorenzo Carcaterra and Michael Crichton respectively. They both also start with the letter 'S'."", u'Bridget Fonda starred in another Elmore Leonard adaptation, Touch (1997) released in the same year as Jackie Brown (1997). Like Quentin Tarantino, Paul Schrader wrote and directed his film. Incidentally, Robert De Niro starred in Taxi Driver (1976), also written by Schrader.', u'Trademark Tarantino snappy dialogue; when Ordell Robbie (Samuel L. Jackson) has learnt from Louis Gara (Robert De Niro) that he\'d seen Max Cherry (Robert Forster) in a department store. ""Max Ch-? You seen Max Cherry in the dress department... Man, look at me when I talk to you! You saw that motherfucker in the dress department when we\'re about to get a half million and you don\'t think nothing of it!"" What happened here was that Ordell started to talk to Louis, only to catch him looking out of the van window. This only served to dangerously enrage Ordell further.', u'Marks the second time director Quentin Tarantino and actor Samuel L. Jackson collaborated in a director/actor relation.', u""Quentin Tarantino: electronic voice on Jackie's answering machine."", u'Quentin Tarantino: [long takes] When Jackie leaves the dressing room after making the switch and when Louis and Ordell are at the bar.', u'Quentin Tarantino: [singing along to music] Melanie, Jackie, and Max all sing along in the car.', u""Despite being the title character, Jackie doesn't have any lines until half an hour into the film."", u""Body Count: four.

In the fridge, there's a picture of Samuel L. Jackson naked inside a bath tub. This pic is from his role in Goodfellas (1990)."", u""Quentin Tarantino was criticized for excessive, exploitative violence in preceding hits like Reservoir Dogs (1992) and Pulp Fiction (1994), so his sarcastic response to critics in this film, was to tone down the blood and guts. When Melanie is shot by Louis, we don't see anything, and when Ordell kills Louis, we are behind the action, out of view of the bullet contact."", u'In this film, Robert De Niro has sex with Bridget Fonda. He also had sex with her aunt, Jane Fonda, in the film Stanley and Iris (1990). De Niro is the only actor to have had sex in a film with both the aunt and the niece.', u'Director trademark (black humor): after Louis shot Melanie in the parking lot, in the chest and stomach - as she was making fun of him for not remembering where he had parked the car - he turned to look down briefly at where Melanie lay dead. Louis then said, ""See? Just where I said it was"". He acted like nothing had happened, and drove off soon thereafter.', u'The scene where Robert De Niro shoots Bridget Fonda in the parking lot, is similar to a scene in True Romance (1993) - which was also written by Quentin Tarantino - where Christopher Walken shoots Dennis Hopper. De Niro and Walken had been severely provoked by Fonda and Hopper respectively in these scenes. Additionally De Niro and Walken co-starred in The Deer Hunter (1978).', u'When Louis Gara (Robert De Niro) and Ordell Robbie (Samuel L. Jackson) are talking in the van - before Ordell kills Louis - Ordell says ""Or"" a few times. ""Or"" could be seen as short for Ordell.', u'Notice when Ordell shoots Louis in the van, we see some blood, yet Louis doesn\'t even cry out in pain. Probably because he\'s so stunned at being shot. Then Ordell leans across and says, ""What the fuck happened to you, man? You aah-ss used to be beautiful!"" He then puts Louis out of his misery by firing a second shot, this time into his head and kills him.']","[u'USA::8 December 1997 (New York City, New York)\n (premiere)', u'USA::11 December 1997 (Westwood, California)\n (premiere)', u'USA::25 December 1997', u'Chile::1998', u'Peru::1998', u'Germany::17 February 1998 (Berlin International Film Festival)', u'Spain::23 February 1998', u'Australia::5 March 1998', u'UK::20 March 1998 (London)', u'Finland::27 March 1998', u'Italy::27 March 1998', u'Sweden::27 March 1998', u'Belgium::1 April 1998', u'France::1 April 1998', u'Denmark::3 April 1998', u'Israel::3 April 1998', u'Norway::3 April 1998', u'Iceland::8 April 1998', u'Singapore::9 April 1998', u'UK::10 April 1998', u'Ireland::10 April 1998', u'Germany::16 April 1998', u'Switzerland::24 April 1998 (German speaking region)', u'Portugal::24 April 1998 (Lisbon)', u'Japan::25 April 1998', u'South Africa::30 April 1998', u'Portugal::4 May 1998', u'South Korea::16 May 1998', u'Netherlands::20 May 1998', u'Brazil::22 May 1998', u'Turkey::22 May 1998', u'Estonia::12 June 1998', u'Greece::12 June 1998', u'Mexico::19 June 1998', u'Slovakia::16 July 1998', u'Argentina::20 August 1998', u'Uruguay::19 September 1998', u'Poland::20 November 1998', u'Portugal::26 February 1999 (Fantasporto Film Festival)', u'Hungary::25 March 1999', u'Thailand::26 November 1999', u'Brazil::30 April 2004 (re-release)', u'Czech Republic::30 March 2009 (Febio Film Festival)', u'Japan::7 June 2012 (Champs-\xc9lys\xe9es Film Festival)', u'Chile::28 March 2015 (FEMCINE, Festival Cine de Mujeres)', u'Ukraine::16 July 2017 (Odessa International Film Festival)']",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Many deaths and action scenes had to be heavily cut down for R rating. These include death scenes of Pick Up guy and his friend at the bar and death of Danny Trejo\'s character. By far the most major excision came at the end of the film, which originally contained a large-scale shootout between El Mariachi, Carolina, Bucho and his thugs at Bucho\'s mansion. However, owing to the amount of footage the MPAA demanded be removed from the scene, Rodriguez elected to remove the sequence in its entirety, giving the film its final fade-out ending.Two additional scenes were also deleted featuring the ""crotch-gun"" (seen in the guitar case). Originally, the gun was used by El Mariachi during the second bar shootout when he uses it to shoot the pony tailed thug in balls before whipping out his pistols from his sleeves and finishing him off. In a second deleted scene, the crotch gun gone off accidentally while Banderas is in bed with Hayek, blowing a hole through the guitar that they were playing.', u'The movie was originally entitled ""El Pistolero"" (""The Gunman"") to be consistent with the first film, El Mariachi (1992). It was changed at the request of the studio. In Mexico, it was released as ""Pistolero"".', u""During the shoot out in the bar Cheech Marin's character is rarely seen. This is because they could only shoot his scenes in the six days they had him, so they made an approximation of what the shot up bar would look like and shot his scenes with it, putting his character behind it for most of the shootout."", u'Danny Trejo has no lines throughout the whole movie (though playing a fairly prominent character).', u""A week after finishing shooting this film, Robert Rodriguez and Antonio Banderas were back in the studio, working on Rodriguez's segment of Four Rooms (1995)."", u'The same ""penis gun"" that Sex Machine uses in From Dusk Till Dawn (1996) can be seen in this movie in the guitar case when Carolina looks inside it.

Never using the drug himself, Quentin Tarantino had Travolta research his character\'s addiction by speaking to a recovering heroin addict that he (Quentin) knew personally. Travolta asked Tarantino\'s friend to tell him how could he know what it felt like to be on heroin (without actually using it of course).

And you will know My name is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee."" However, the parts about the righteous man and the shepherd are not real. It\'s likely that Tarantino actually included it as a reference to the Sonny Chiba film Karate Kiba (1976) as the quote is almost word for word from the opening scene.

Quentin Tarantino had been working on his script for seven months and, even though Madsen knew of Quentin's plans and had expressed his desire to play the part, Madsen had already signed up for the role of Virgil Earp in Wyatt Earp (1994), and was unable to commit to the film. He later regretted the decision."", u'Speculation abounds as to the nature of the mysterious glowing contents of the case (which Tarantino said was simply a MacGuffin plot device): Could it be Elvis\'s gold suit, seen worn by Val Kilmer (as Elvis) in True Romance (1993)?The most persistent theory is that it is Marcellus Wallace\'s soul. The story goes that when the Devil takes a person\'s soul, it is removed through the back of the head. When we see the back of Marcellus\'s head he has a Band-Aid covering the precise spot indicated by tradition for soul removal. Perhaps Marcellus sold his soul to the devil which would also explain why the combination to open the briefcase is 666.Quentin Tarantino has said that the band-aid on the back of Marsellus Wallace\'s neck had nothing to do with an allusion to the Devil stealing Marsellus\'s soul... but that the actor Ving Rhames had a scar on the back of his neck he wanted to cover up.According to Roger Avary, who co-wrote the script with Quentin Tarantino, the original plan was to have the briefcase contain diamonds (urban legend has it that they were the diamonds from Resevoir Dogs). This seemed neither exciting nor original, so Avary and Tarantino decided to have the briefcase\'s contents never appear on screen; this way each film-goer could mentally ""fill in the blank"" with whatever struck his or her imagination as best fitting the description ""so beautiful"". The orange light bulb (projecting shimmering light onto the actors\' faces) was a last-minute decision and added a completely unintended fantastic element. In a radio interview with Howard Stern in late 2003, Quentin Tarantino was asked by a caller the contents of the briefcase, and he answered, ""It\'s whatever the viewer wants it to be.""', u'Chandler Lindauer had to sit through the Captain Koons speech delivered by Christopher Walken.

Fruit Brute (which, along with Yummy Mummy, Frankenberry, Boo Berry, and Count Chocula, make up the monster cereals) was later discontinued, along with ""Yummy Mummy."" Quentin Tarantino has held onto a box and drops it into scenes from time to time. It appeared in Reservoir Dogs (1992), too.', u'Many people believe that the band-aid on Ving Rhames\' neck was an intentional choice by the filmmakers. In reality, it came from an accident Rhames had while shaving his head. When Quentin Tarantino noticed this, it inspired him to open the ""Vincent Vega and Marsellus Wallace"" sequence with a close-up of the band-aid instead. Ultimately Tarantino liked showing the band-aid rather than Rhames\' face because it accentuated the character\'s mercurial nature and was more visually exciting than a series of single shots of Rhames and Bruce Willis.', u""The dance that Vince (John Travolta) and Mia (Uma Thurman) perform at Jack Rabbit Slims was copied, movement by movement, from the dance performed early in Fellini's 1963 classic 8\xbd (1963) by Gloria Morin (Barbara Steele) and Mario Mezzabotta (Mario Pisu)."", u'The screenplay says that Zed and Maynard are brothers.', u'The role of Butch was originally supposed to be an up and coming boxer.

In Back to the Future, when Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) joins his mother for dinner, after being hit with the car by the television set, there is the same two board games to the left.

This is the same surname as Vince (John Travolta) from Quentin Tarantino\'s other film, Pulp Fiction (1994). Tarantino has revealed that Vic and Vince are brothers.

Buscemi duly complied.', u""During filming, a paramedic was kept on the set to make sure that Mr. Orange's (Tim Roth) amount of blood loss was kept consistent and realistic to that of a real gunshot victim."", u'Michael Madsen had difficulty filming the torture scenes due to his strong aversion to violence of any kind, and was particularly reluctant when he was required to hit actor Kirk Baltz. When Baltz ad-libbed a line that his character has a child at home, Madsen, who had just become a new father himself, was so disturbed by the idea of leaving a child fatherless that he almost couldn\'t finish the scene. This take made it into in the movie, and in some versions of the film, you can clearly hear someone, possibly Quentin Tarantino himself, utter ""Oh, no no!"" off-screen.', u'Tim Roth refused to read for the film.

It was then that Tarantino received an answerphone message from Harvey Keitel, asking if he could not only be in the film but help produce it. Keitel had gotten involved via the wife of Bender's acting class teacher, who had managed to get a copy of the script to him.

Woods\' agent refused the offers without ever mentioning it to Woods, as the sums offered were well below Woods\' usual salary. When Tarantino and Woods later met for the first time, Woods learned of the offer and was annoyed enough to get a new agent. Tarantino avoided telling Woods which role he was offered, ""because the actor who played the role was magnificent anyway."" It has been speculated that the role that Tarantino was referring to was Mr. Orange.', u'The title for the film came to Quentin Tarantino via a patron at the now-famous Video Archives. While working there, Tarantino would often recommend little-known titles to customers, and when he suggested Louis Malle\'s Au Revoir les Enfants (1987), the patron mockingly replied, ""I don\'t want to see no reservoir dogs!"" The title is never spoken in the film, however.', u'One of the radio ads heard in the background is for ""Jack Rabbit Slim\'s"", the fictitious 1950\'s-themed restaurant and ""home of the $5 milkshake"" that was also featured in Tarantino\'s second film, Pulp Fiction (1994)', u""Mr. Blonde's Cadillac Coupe de Ville actually belonged to Michael Madsen, because the budget wasn't big enough to buy a car for the character."", u""In an interview with Empire magazine, career criminal Edward Bunker (Mr. Blue) stated that the film was unrealistic.

George Clooney read for the role of Mr. Blonde/Vic Vega but was turned down, and Christopher Walken refused the same role. Vincent Gallo turned down the role of Mr. Pink. Samuel L. Jackson auditioned for the role of Mr. Orange. Once Tim Roth was cast, Quentin Tarantino originally wanted him to play Mr. Blonde or Mr. Pink.

It also was voted most influential movie in the past 15 years by the same magazine.', u'The film was released in America with almost no promotion, so it did not do that well at the box office. In England, however, it was such a huge hit that Quentin Tarantino would be mobbed as he walked down the street in London.

Tarantino was content with having no other music in the film as long as he could use that song. The other songs were secured thanks to the producers\' managing to make a record deal for the soundtrack. Tarantino and the producers were well aware that that plan might not have worked out at all.', u'According to Steve Buscemi in a recent podcast interview, everyone had a difficult time with Lawrence Tierney because he was easily distracted and kept forgetting his lines. Quentin Tarantino and everyone else were so upset with him that Quentin fired Lawrence on the third day of filming.', u'At the end of the breakfast scene you can see Quentin Tarantino raise his arm to end the scene. But the scene carries on anyway, this is because Lawrence Tierney had botched his lines over and over in previous takes. This was left in the final cut of the film.', u""At the very first screening of the film at Sundance, Quentin Tarantino stood up in the middle of the movie and told them to stop projecting, due to the fact that the entire film is shot in widescreen and the projector only had a normal-sized lens (not meant for widescreen), so half of whatever was shot wasn't up on screen."", u'In the commentary track on the True Romance (1993) DVD, Quentin Tarantino says that Tony Scott read both the ""True Romance"" and ""Reservoir Dogs"" scripts, and told Tarantino he wanted to direct ""Reservoir Dogs"". Tarantino told him he could have ""True Romance"" but that he himself was going to direct ""Reservoir Dogs"".', u""Editor Sally Menke's agent originally lobbied for her not to take the film. Menke disagreed and went on to edit Quentin Tarantino's first six movies."", u'Directly prior to the scene showing the colored bottles of soap, you see two shirts hanging on the wall, and a rag in the distance on the floor. These are appropriately in sync with the surnames of the characters in their present states. Mr. White and Mr. Pink are upright and close to each other, corresponding to the two shirt colors, while the orange rag laying in the distance would be the position of Mr. Orange in the next room.', u'Quentin Tarantino and his producer Lawrence Bender used to joke that they were the most inexperienced people on the set.', u'In Mr. White\'s flashback, Joe asks him about a girl named Alabama. This is a reference to Patricia Arquette\'s character from True Romance (1993). Quentin Tarantino has stated that he originally intended this character to meet up with Mr. White and to become partners in crime. When ""True Romance"" was released a year after this film, the ending was changed, and this backstory became inconsistent. Alabama never went on to meet up with Mr. White.', u'Quentin Tarantino wrote the first draft in three and a half weeks.', u""The opening conversation concerns a song by Madonna. Chris Penn, playing Nice Guy Eddie Cabot, was Madonna's former brother-in-law. His older brother Sean Penn was married to Madonna for 4 years."", u'The first draft script called for Pink Floyd\'s ""Money"" where ""Little Green Bag"" is now. It was later changed because Quentin Tarantino heard ""Little Green Bag"" over the radio and became extremely nostalgic. The original song choice ""Money"" by the band Pink Floyd and the existing song ""Little Green Bag"" both feature colours; ""Pink"" for Pink Floyd and ""Green"" for ""Little Green Bag"".', u'The line ""Let\'s go to work"" is often attributed to this film, but in fact comes from The Professionals (1966), one of Quentin Tarantino\'s favourite movies.', u""At age seventeen, Edward Bunker, a former career criminal, was the youngest felon to be sent to San Quentin. He was a novelist, and also played cons in other films -- Runaway Train (1985), The Longest Yard (2005), and Straight Time (1978) (which was based on his novel). In addition, he worked as a technical advisor on other films -- Heat (1995), for instance. Jon Voight's character in 'Heat' was based on Bunker."", u""The warehouse where the majority of the movie takes place was once a mortuary, and thus is full of caskets. Mr. Blonde doesn't sit down on a crate, it's actually an old hearse he perches on."", u'Kirk Baltz recalls that a more graphic version of the ear-cutting scene was filmed, involving a tube running up to his ear that squirted blood. Michael Madsen, however, has said he thought it was ""rather tame"", after seeing the scene play out that way.', u'Monte Hellman was originally tapped to direct the film, as Quentin Tarantino was a complete unknown. However, when Tarantino sold the screenplay for True Romance (1993) for $50,000, he lobbied hard to direct the film himself. Hellman took on an executive producer role instead.', u'The final answer print of the film came back from the lab just 3 days before its world premiere at Sundance.', u'WILHELM SCREAM: (at around 20 mins) The famous scream is heard when Mr. Pink pushes a pedestrian on the sidewalk while being pursued by cops during his escape from the failed jewel heist.', u'In the script, it was Mr. White who doesn\'t tip, not Mr. Pink. Also, it was Mr. Pink who had the first lines about ""Like a Virgin."" This was when Quentin Tarantino still intended to play Mr. Pink himself.', u'When Mr. Pink has his speech about not tipping, he mentions that he once worked for minimum wage. This might be a reference to Pulp Fiction (1994), where Steve Buscemi, the actor who plays Mr. Pink, is a waiter who serves Mia and Vincent.', u'The suit Harvey Keitel wears was his own. It had been a specially-made gift from French designer Agn\xe8s B..', u'The theatrical release of the film contains no female speaking parts. There are some in the 10th anniversary DVD, including Nina Siemaszko as McKlusky.', u'In the opening scene, when Mr. Pink is giving his tipping speech, he says when he orders coffee he wants his cup filled six times. Earlier in the film, when Chris Penn starts talking about ""The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia"", Mr. Pink can be seen about to take a sip from his cup before realizing it\'s empty. He then looks for the waitress.', u'Mr. Pink\'s numerous references to being ""professional"" are a reference to movie director Howard Hawks, a favorite of Quentin Tarantino\'s.', u'In the first scene of the Mr. Blonde chapter, when Vic Vega is meeting with Joe and Nice Guy Eddie, he states that his parole officer is Seymour Scagnetti. This character may be related to the character Jack Scagnetti, the detective in Natural Born Killers (1994), which was also scripted by Quentin Tarantino.', u'In the French version, the line ""If you fucking beat this prick long enough, he\'ll tell you he started the goddamn Chicago fire"" was translated into ""he\'ll tell you he blew the bridge over the River Kwai"".', u'Was voted the second greatest directorial debut of all time behind Citizen Kane (1941).', u'During a screening at Sitges Film Festival, fifteen people walked out, including Wes Craven and special makeup effects artist Rick Baker. Baker later told Quentin Tarantino to take the walkout as a ""compliment"" and explained that he found the violence unnerving because of its heightened sense of realism. Tarantino commented about it at the time: ""It happens at every single screening. For some people the violence, or the rudeness of the language, is a mountain they can\'t climb. That\'s OK. It\'s not their cup of tea. But I am affecting them. I wanted that scene to be disturbing.""', u""While driving in the car, someone mentions Pam Grier.

According to Duchovny, Quentin Tarantino told him, ""I like what you do, I just don\'t know if I want you to do it in my movie.""', u'Of his decision to not show the heist itself, Quentin Tarantino has said that the reason was initially budgetary, but that he had always liked the idea of not showing it, and stuck with that idea in order to make the details of the heist ambiguous. He has said that the technique allows for the realization that the film is ""about other things""; a similar plot outline that appears in the stage play Glengarry Glen Ross (and its film adaptation) in which the mentioned robbery is never shown on camera. Tarantino has compared this to the work of a novelist, and has said that he wanted the film to be about something that is not seen, and that he wanted it to ""play with a real-time clock as opposed to a movie clock ticking"".', u'During the bathroom scene where Mr. White and Mr. Pink are discussing who is alive or dead, and specifically Mr. Blonde, there is a hint that Mr. Blonde is alive. Much like the white and pink shirts and the orange rag, the bathroom contains one other item hinting at a character. Behind Mr. White when he is doing his hair there is a yellow sink, suggesting Mr. Blonde is alive.', u'Jon Cryer was offered the role of Mr. Pink but he turned it down. He admitted that he did not understand the script and would not have gotten the part.', u'Matt Dillon was considered for the role of Mr. Blonde.', u""Viggo Mortensen auditioned for a role.

Besides, after auditioning several other prospective actors who mostly wanted to play any character but Mr. Orange, Roth was only too anxious to take on that role.', u'During the torture scene, you can faintly hear whispering in the background, this is said to be Quentin Tarantino.', u'Dennis Hopper was offered the role of Mr Pink by Quentin Tarantino and Harvey Keitel, but he was unavailable.', u'The torture scene between Mr. Blonde and the cop is rated #1 on ""watch mojo\'s top 10 movie torture scenes of all time"".', u'In an interview featured in the 2011 documentary I Am Fishead, psychologist Robert D. Hare reports that Keitel\'s character Mr. White and Madsen\'s Mr. Blonde illustrate the differences between the mental health diagnoses of sociopathy and psychopathy. Mr. White is a sociopath, a professional criminal who nonetheless has some loyalty and standards of conduct; he takes no pleasure in violence but regards the use of force as an occasional necessity in his vocation. In contrast, Mr. Blonde enjoys torturing the captured police officer; Mr. White explicitly describes Mr. Blonde as a ""psychopath"" and condemns his reckless shooting of civilians.', u""Both this film and Pulp Fiction (1994) have prologues featuring criminals at breakfast. Tim Roth links these scenes, as he's in both of them."", u""On their way to the first meeting about the heist, Misters Pink, White, and Orange, and Nice Guy Eddie, are discussing a television show.

That role went to Bruce Willis, with whom Madsen later worked on Sin City (2005). Quentin Tarantino also worked with Willis two years later in Pulp Fiction (1994). Steve Buscemi also appears in Pulp Fiction, as a waiter who resembles Buddy Holly. He also worked with Willis on Armageddon (1998).', u'Seymour Cassel and Steve Buscemi went to the audition together. Steve auditioned for Nice Guy Eddie and Seymour auditioned for Joe.', u'About three minutes into the movie a silhouette of Mickey Mouse is seen, cast by a fan in between Steve Buscemi and Edward Bunker.', u'Lawrence Bender, who is the producer of this movie, also has a small cameo appearance in it as one of the police officers that is chasing Mr. Pink.', u'In Pulp Fiction (1994), ""The Wolf"" (Harvey Keitel) has a phone call while in one of Jimmy\'s rooms, ending with the line, ""You\'re a good man, Joe. Thanks a bunch."" This might be a nod to Quentin Tarantino\'s work with Lawrence Tierney in this film.', u'Oddly enough, in all the film\'s advertising, including posters and the theatrical trailer, Tim Roth is billed second while Michael Madsen receives the honorary ""and"" billing at the end of the roll call. However in the film itself, Madsen and Roth switch billings, as Madsen is now second, behind Harvey Keitel, and Roth with the ""and"" credit at the end.', u'Although Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth and Steve Buscemi all went on to appear in Quentin Tarantino\'s even more ambitious follow-up Pulp Fiction (1994), none of them shared a scene together. The only ""Reservoir Dogs"" to share a scene together were Tarantino and Keitel.', u'Even though Quentin Tarantino abhors product placement, behind Harvey Keitel there is a can of stain blocker, aptly named ""Kilz"".

""There are actually no reservoirs or dogs in it, Tarantino claims he got the title from mishearing Au Revoir les Enfants (1987)"". Collins was correct overall, except he overlooked the scene when Mr. Orange (Tim Roth) goes into the men\'s room during his fabricated commode story in a flashback. The Los Angeles sheriffs had a German Shepherd - a breed of dog of course - with them.', u'Quentin Tarantino discovered Steve Buscemi ""looking like real criminal"" in a test for a Neil Simon movie.', u'This film contains 269 uses of ""Fuck"" in a 99 minute run time.

One producer offered $1.6 million, but only if the ending was changed so that everyone who was dead came back to life, the whole thing having been a hoax or a con of some kind. Another offered $500,000 ... but only if his girlfriend could play Mr. Blonde. (Bender said it was such a bizarre idea that he and Tarantino actually considered it.)', u'Mr. White is the only ""color"" who makes no contribution to the ""Like a Virgin"" discussion. Mr. Brown is the only ""color"" who makes no contribution to the ""tipping"" discussion.', u""Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Chris Penn and Steve Buscemi have all worked with director Robert Altman. Keitel in Buffalo Bill and the Indians, or Sitting Bull's History Lesson (1976), Roth in Vincent & Theo (1990), Penn in Short Cuts (1993) and Buscemi in Kansas City (1996).

He's Andrzej Sekula; previously Tierney worked with a cinematographer called Andrzej Bartkowiak on Prizzi's Honor (1985). Incidentally Michael Madsen - Tierney's co-star in Reservoir Dogs (1992) - worked with Bartkowiak three years later on Species (1995)."", u'In Harvey Keitel - The first documentary - To be an actor, (available on YouTube), two jobs Keitel did were selling shoes and working as a court stenographer. The hilariously synthesized voice of \'Paul\', who narrates the text, says of Keitel selling shoes, ""But he didn\'t like the work. The mundanity and the monotony of it rapidly drove him wild"". In Reservoir Dogs (1992), Keitel, (as Mr. White), wears black shoes to match his suit. It\'s ironic that Keitel was a court sternograher, as this is part of law enforcement, given that he has a tendency to play criminals in his films quite often.', u'This is the second film where Michael Madsen tortures a man who is tied to a chair with a razorblade. The first was Kill Me Again (1989).', u""Cast members Lawrence Tierney and Lawrence Bender - also the film's producer - have the same first name."", u'Harvey Keitel and Chris Penn also co-starred in Imaginary Crimes (1994).

This is why anyone who smokes is smoking a pack of ""Red Apples"", a brand Tarantino made up. The exception in this movie is when Mr. White offers Mr. Pink a Chesterfield cigarette. (Additionally, any cereal in his films (Fruit Brute, Kabooom!, etc.) are all brands that died out in the 1970s and no longer exist.)', u'Quentin Tarantino: [long take] (at around 57 mins) While torturing the cop, we follow Mr. Blonde continuously from the warehouse to his car outside, back into the warehouse again.', u""Quentin Tarantino: [trunk] Before the audience sees the contents of Mr. Blonde's trunk, the camera looks up at Mr. White, Mr. Blonde, and Mr. Pink from inside the trunk."", u'The opening scene in the coffee shop contains subtle foreshadowing about the identity of the ""rat"". When Joe demands to know which crook didn\'t contribute to the tip, Mr. Orange is the one who snitches on Mr. Pink.', u'According to Quentin Tarantino, Mr. Pink does in fact survive. You can verify this by increasing the volume of the background sounds: When Mr. Pink runs out of the building with the diamonds, police officers can be heard shouting at him to put his hands on the ground. Gunshots can be heard, then Mr. Pink shouts that he has been shot. You can then hear the officers talking to each other as Pink is arrested.', u""Chris Penn's blood squibs accidentally went off too early in the big stand-off scene, forcing him to fall to the floor. There is not, as is commonly believed, a mystery round being fired off-screen."", u""The actress who plays the lady Mr. Orange shoots was Tim Roth's dialect coach. Roth insisted that she take the role, as she was very hard on him."", u'Although he supposedly killed more people than any of the other characters did, Mr. Blonde is never seen killing anyone on-screen.', u'In the scene where Nice Guy Eddie talks on his cell phone about the botched robbery, an orange balloon can be seen floating past the car. Some believe that this was intentional, as to foreshadow Mr. Orange as the rat. However, Quentin Tarantino claims that it was accidental.', u""According to cast member Edward Bunker, there was a scene that would have shown exactly what happened to his character, Mr. Blue but the scene was cut due to the limited budget. He also said actor Lawrence Tierney could never remember his lines, so Tierney's scenes took a while to shoot."", u'The promotional posters for ""Reservoir Dogs"" say ""Five strangers team up for the perfect crime..."". The criminals in the movie - Mr. Pink, Mr. White, Mr. Orange, Mr. Blonde, Mr. Brown and Mr. Blue - are in fact six strangers. It is possible it says 5 instead of 6 as Mr. Orange, being an undercover cop, would already know who the others are.', u'In the scene where Mr. Brown dies. Mr. White and Mr. Orange walk away from the car and as they are walking away you can see several crew members in the background behind a truck.', u'At the end of the scene where Mr. Orange is talking to the other undercover cop in Johnnies restaurant, they are talking about the comic character ""The Thing"" immediately after he says that it cuts to him in his apartment answering a phone. As he reaches to pick up the phone, he knocks over an action figure of Iron Man, and the action figure of the Thing is visible at the edge of the table.', u'The total death count in this film (onscreen and off) is at least 17. Four clerks in the jewelry store, five of the six crooks (Mr. White, Mr. Orange, Mr. Blonde, Mr. Blue, and Mr. Brown), Joe Cabot and his son Nice Guy Eddie, the two cops Mr. White shot, the cop in the trunk (Marvin Nash), the cop Mr. Pink shot, the woman Mr. Orange shot, and the ""black girl"" Mr. Blonde shoots in the bank. The number of police officers Mr. Blonde had to shoot to escape the jewelry store is not mentioned. It can be assumed that Mr. Pink is not shot after he flees the warehouse; although you hear gunshots, he can be heard very faintly yelling something to the effect of ""give up"" shortly thereafter.', u""When asked about Mr. Blue, Joe says that he is 'Dead as Dillinger.' Lawrence Tierney played the title character in Dillinger (1945)."", u'Many people have asked Quentin Tarantino why Mr. Orange confessed to being a cop to Mr. White at the end of the movie. They argued that he only had to keep quiet for 60 more seconds and he would be in the clear. He mentions this in the DVD commentary for the film. His response to these individuals is that they did not truly understand the movie, if they are asking this question. Tarantino says that in all the Asian countries that this movie was released in, this question was never once asked. He says that in Japan they have a word for this called ""jingi"". Without an English equivalent, it basically means that this was something that Mr. Orange HAD to do as a man. Something that he owed Mr. White. Furthermore, he could only do it in those 60 seconds, when Mr. White would have the opportunity to do whatever he deemed necessary.', u'When Mr. Pink is running from the cops, you can see a blue van with a window in the background, after Mr. Brown dies, Mr. White and Mr. Orange are walking away through an alley, the same blue van can be seen parked in the alley.', u'Supposedly Mr. Blonde and the character Vincent Vega from Pulp Fiction (1994) are brothers In a deleted scene of Pulp Fiction, Vincent Vega tells Mia Wallace that the singer, Suzanne Vega is his cousin and that makes Suzanne Vega Mr. Blondes cousin as well.', u'During the scene when Joe Cabot has given the men their false, colour-coded names, then Mr. Pink objects with, ""Oh why am I Mr. Pink?"" ""Because you\'re a faggot, alright?"" quips Tierney, causing Mr. Brown to laugh, watch Mr. Orange aka undercover cop Freddy Newendyke. In the ensuing argument between Cabot and Pink, Newendyke looks quite appprehensive, probably due to how angry Cabot gets with Pink. This foreshadows how angry Cabot gets with Newendyke at the end, when it\'s out in the open about him being the rat.', u'In a way Joe Cabot was speaking from experience when Mr. Pink said, ""Mr. Blue is dead?"" ""As dead as Dillinger"", Cabot replied. Lawrence Tierney played John Dillinger in Dillinger (1945). He also starred in a remake, Dillinger (1991).', u'Tim Roth gets gut shot and is cared for by Harvey Keitel. In Taxi Driver (1976), Sport, also played by Keitel, gets gut shot by Robert De Niro.', u'In the scene just before Joe Cabot gives the Reservoir Dogs their names, he says, ""All I want you guys to talk about if you have to, is what you\'re gonna do. That should do it"". While Joe is still speaking, the camera zooms in on Mr Orange, indicating in advance that he\'s the rat.', u""When Mr Orange has joined Nice Guy Eddie, Mr White and Mr Pink in the car, and Mr Orange, who in reality is an undercover cop called Freddy Newendyke and his fellow cops are following Eddie's car, there is an indication - no pun intended as cars are involved in this scene - that Mr Orange will rat on them, as in any instance where he isn't saying anything, he has a sly look on his face. It can only end badly for Mr Orange, as he soon gets in way over his head."", u'When a panicked Mr. Pink first arrives at the rendezvous point, he tells Mr. White that they were all set up and that there must be a rat within the group.

They obliged, and acted out an episode in which the girls visit London on stage in front of the queen and her family.', u'Although there were four women living in the house, there were always only three chairs around that famous kitchen table. That was strictly due to the limits of filming-to avoid either squeezing all four shoulder-to-shoulder or having one actress with her back to the camera.

Rose then adds ""but what happens when there is only one of us left?"" which, after a reflective yet morbid pause, Sophia replies ""Don\'t worry, I can take care of myself."" The eerie coincidence of this scene is that, Betty White has outlived her costars, becoming ""the only one left"" as her line once questioned.', u'Broadway legend Elaine Stritch was considered for the role of Dorothy. According to Stritch, many of the NBC executives in her audition liked her but Susan Harris didn\'t and felt she was too vulgar for the role. In her one-woman show, ""Elaine Stritch at Liberty (2002)"", Stritch recounted that she ""blew"" the audition by trying to break the ice by asking if she could improvise with the dialogue a little, and then, as a joke, changing the line ""Ying, don\'t forget the hors d\'oeuvres"" into ""Ying, don\'t forget the fucking hors d\'oeuvres.""', u'Estelle Getty had trouble remembering her lines.', u'All four main characters (Dorothy, Rose, Blanche and Sophia) appear in every episode.', u'Each time the door opens and Stan (Herb Edelman) appears, he always says, ""Hi, it\'s me, Stan.""', u""In the early 1990s, in a dispute over the network's per-episode licensing fee, Touchstone Television considered taking the still-running show away from NBC and offering it to CBS or ABC."", u'Some media critics and insiders referred to the show as ""Miami Nice"", a contrasting reference to the popular TV series Miami Vice (1984).', u'While filming a ""Colombo - \'Ashes to Ashes\' "" (Movie of the Week in the Spring of 1998) at Universal-MCA Film City-Studios, Rue McClanahan performed in a guest role, as \'Verity Chandler\' - a nasty devious miserably wicked evil tongued Hollywood gossip columnist - on Peter Falk\'s ""Columbo"" MOW prime-time-network special. The film was written by, directed, and featured actor Patrick McGoohan - as Eric Prince, seething with resentment of his ex-lover Verity, murderous and bloodthirsty for revenge. During breaks in filming, Rue McClanahan related to Falk\'s production designer Hub Braden\'s question when asked - ""In \'The Golden Girls\' series - how much did each of the featured performers contribute, ad-lib, improvise in their first Monday sit-down read of their dialogue for their character\'s role?"" McClanahan\'s response was a matter-of-fact statement to his inquiry! ""Not much! Bea Arthur arrived in the rehearsal hall, just sat at the conference table and read her lines. Ditto for Estelle Getty. Betty White and myself would interject comments, and usually, our ad-lib/improv dialogue ideas were noted, accepted by Susan Harris, with our spontaneous line idea interjected into our current script. Bea Arthur performed, reading exactly, what she had been given to say; the same, as well - with Estelle. Betty and myself were usually animated in our dialogue readings, bouncing off with an ad-lib or other flippant dialogue.

As a fan and supporter of celluloid, Quentin Tarantino aggressively fought with distributors for the film to be shown in its original Ultra Panavision 70 presentation. As a result, 50 theaters internationally were retrofitted with anamorphic-lensed 70mm analogue film projectors, to display the film as he intended it to be seen. It was released on December 25, 2015, as a roadshow presentation, in 70mm analogue film format theaters exclusively, before being released in digital theaters on December 30, 2015.', u'Quentin Tarantino announced at Comic-Con in 2015 that Ennio Morricone would compose the score for the film. Tarantino remarked that it would be the first western scored by Morricone in forty years. He had previously used Morricone\'s music in Kill Bill: Vol. 2 (2004), Death Proof (2007), Inglourious Basterds (2009), and Django Unchained (2012). Morricone also wrote a brand-new song, ""Ancora Qui"", for the latter. Despite stories of tensions between the two, Tarantino decided to have Morricone on-board to compose original music for the movie, making it the first film by Tarantino to use mainly an original musical score. Most of his previous films have used mainly source music, with only a few cues of original score.', u'Despite being their sixth collaboration as actor and director, this is the first time that Samuel L.

This also makes it Quentin Tarantino's second film, after Jackie Brown (1997), to not be filmed in the 2.35:1 format."", u'There are three subtle references to Django Unchained (2012) in the film. First, when we meet Major Warren, he is sitting on top of three corpses and a saddle. This saddle was previously owned by Django, and the second is in Minnie\'s Haberdashery. Sitting on the floor of the haberdashery, is Django\'s green corduroy jacket. Both of these references have been confirmed by Samuel L. Jackson. Also, Walton Goggins\' character is called a ""hillbilly"" in both films. In fact, this film was going to feature Django, but Quentin Tarantino scrapped the idea. Samuel L. Jackson and Walton Goggins both have major roles in both films.', u'Composer Ennio Morricone had previously been quoted that he would never work with Quentin Tarantino after how his music was handled on Django Unchained (2012), but ultimately changed his mind, and agreed to score this film.', u'Unfortunately for the production, during the scheduled shooting dates on location in Telluride, Colorado, there was a long streak of nice weather. Large fans and starch, and large overhead sunblocks, were used in many of the outdoors blizzard shots to try to recreate a blizzard. A large amount of the much-needed snow melted away, and production was placed on hiatus. As a fun attempt to try to get more snow, many of the cast and crew members, including Quentin Tarantino, Samuel L. Jackson, and Kurt Russell participated in a local ""ski burn"", making an offering to the ""snow gods"" to try to get it to snow. Coincidentally--or, maybe not so coincidentally--a couple of days later, a big storm came in, and dumped enough snow to enable filming to continue.', u'According to Quentin Tarantino, this film was his metaphoric way of breaking down his feelings about The Thing (1982)--i.e., the way he felt watching it for the first time in a movie theater.', u'This film\'s 70mm roadshow version is a ""heavyweight"" in more ways than one. The analogue film is spooled on twenty reels, with a combined running time of 187 minutes, and weighs in at over 250 pounds.', u'At times, the cast and crew worked in a refrigerated set, in which the temperature was thirty degrees Fahrenheit (-1\xbaC).', u'The Weinstein Company spent eight to ten million dollars to find, procure, rebuild, and install 70mm analogue film projectors, and to train the 200 projectionists needed to operate them in the 96 U.S. theaters (80,000 dollars plus, per location) that showed the roadshow version of this film.', u'Pre-production was halted in early 2014 after the script was leaked online, Quentin Tarantino stated he would no longer shoot it as a movie, but would rewrite it, and release it as a novel instead. However, production was resumed in early 2015.', u'The sixth collaboration between Quentin Tarantino and Samuel L.

Jackson, Kurt Russell, Tim Roth, and Michael Madsen in mind. The role of Daisy Domergue was less specific, and many actresses were considered before Jennifer Jason Leigh was cast. Quentin Tarantino said, ""Daisy became one of the most interesting characters, because she\'s on the page, but she\'s not on the page; an actress literally needs to invest in playing that character from beginning to end. They have to get you to that last chapter. It had to be an actress I could trust, and also a performer you enjoy watching her character work. When Jennifer came in, she was very impressive in the reading, but what really got me, was I\'d just started watching a bunch of her movies. I had a whole Jennifer Jason Leigh film festival. I watched one, and I couldn\'t wait to put the next one in, she was such an entertaining actress, especially about that time in the 90s, like eXistenZ (1999), Georgia (1995), and especially Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle (1994). Those movies were built around her. Her performance was the center of the movie, and everything was built around that, and that\'s what was needed for Daisy.""', u'Early test screenings had a runtime of over three hours, and included an intermission.', u'The name of the stagecoach line ""Butterfield Overland Stage"" is the same as in 3:10 to Yuma (1957).', u'The song Daisy Domergue sings when she plays the guitar is an Australian folk song called ""Jim Jones at Botany Bay"".', u'During the development stage, Christoph Waltz was rumored to be up for the executioner, but it was always intended for Tim Roth.', u'The Thing (1982) was the only film that Quentin Tarantino showed to the cast.', u'Quentin Tarantino explained in interviews, only after the film was released, that the very earliest concept of what became this story, was a sequel to Django Unchained (2012), he began as a novel called ""Django in White Hell"". However, he did not get far with the novel, before he realized that it didn\'t work to have a character whose morals were known to the audience beforehand, nor a character you felt was fairly sure to survive. Tarantino withheld this trivia from interviews, until after the film\'s release, because he was already contesting false reports that the movie would be a sequel to ""Django Unchained"", and didn\'t want to further muddle early public expectations. This is also why, in the wake of the script\'s leaking online, he was considering taking the story back to novel form, when he considered canceling production.', u'Viggo Mortensen was in talks for the character of Jody Domergue, but had to decline due to scheduling conflicts. Josh Brolin was rumored to have been up for a major role, but nothing came of it.', u'According to the written script, the characters of Minnie and Sweet Dave became acquainted with one another as slave and owner, before the Civil War. Sweet Dave once had Minnie as a slave, but they somehow stayed together after the abolition of slavery, for unknown reasons. It could be speculated that Sweet Dave was secretly in love with Minnie, or that he helped her purchase land to start her own business, as a way of paying her reparations for keeping her enslaved in the past. It is believed that Quentin Tarantino has left the audience to make up their own theories about the connection between Minnie and Sweet Dave.', u""Ennio Morricone said in an interview that he accepted Quentin Tarantino's request to score the film, because he liked the script, and because Tarantino gave him full freedom in the composition. Morricone said he considers the film an adventure movie, rather than a Western, and as a result, he tried to make the music sound completely different from his famous Western scores. He based the music on the feelings that the script evoked in him, rather than composing music for specific scenes. Because Morricone had only about a month to produce his score, he added several pieces of music that he had originally written for The Thing (1982), some of which had never been used. Morricone finally gave Tarantino five pieces of music, which he could use in the movie as he pleased."", u""The gory special effects were courtesy of The Walking Dead (2010)'s special effects guru Greg Nicotero, who also contributed to Quentin Tarantino's other films: Inglourious Basterds (2009), Kill Bill: Vol. 1 (2003), Kill Bill: Vol. 2 (2004), and Django Unchained (2012)."", u'Out of the featured cast, only Jennifer Jason Leigh, Demi\xe1n Bichir, Gene Jones, and Channing Tatum had not worked with Quentin Tarantino before.', u'All of the main events in this film take place in less than one day.', u'According to an October 12, 2015, ""Variety"" magazine interview with Quentin Tarantino, the 70mm roadshow cut of the film is 182 minutes long, making it his longest individual film (although the two parts of ""Kill Bill"" are 248 minutes combined).

Six replicas were built for the shoot, and were supposed to be substituted for the real instrument for the smashing shot, but due to a miscommunication, Kurt Russell was not informed, and destroyed the original guitar before anyone could stop him.

He then falls back into the basement and is left by Warren and Mannix to be eaten to death by rats taking shelter from the blizzard."", u'It is never actually proven, at any point during this film, to support Chris Mannix\'s claim that he was truly the ""new Sheriff of Red Rock."" While most fans agree that he was telling the truth, some speculate that he could have very well been lying. Quentin Tarantino has stated in an interview that he\'s allowed the audience to make up their own personal opinions about Mannix\'s authenticity.', u""In an interview with fellow filmmaker Christopher Nolan, Quentin Tarantino revealed that to come to the eventual neck-in-a-noose ending we see in the film, he wrote himself a private draft of the screenplay from Daisy's point of view, so as to acquaint himself enough with the character, thus justifying her dangling demise."", u""Somewhat atypical of a Quentin Tarantino film, there isn't any on-screen killing until 1 hour and 35 minutes into the movie. In the roadshow (70mm) screenings of the movie, the intermission took place immediately after this moment."", u'According to Quentin Tarantino, this film is inspired by the Western television shows Bonanza (1959), The Virginian (1962), and The High Chaparral (1967): ""Twice per season, those shows would have an episode where a bunch of outlaws would take the lead characters hostage. I love it in a Western, where you would pass halfway through the show to find out if they were good or bad guys, and they all had a past that was revealed. Just a bunch of nefarious guys in a room, all telling backstories that may or may not be true. Trap those guys together in a room with a blizzard outside, give them guns, and see what happens!""', u'In the original script, the fate of Major Marquis Warren was written almost entirely different. Jody, hiding underneath the floorboards, was supposed to keep shooting the Major over and over again, until he falls to the floor immobilized. Then a freed Daisy was to finish him off, by crawling across the floor, grabbing a nearby gun, and finally shooting him three times between the eyes.', u""At the end of the movie, when Daisy Domergue is hanged by Warren and Mannix, a pair of snowshoes is visible hanging on the wall in the background behind her, resembling a pair of angel's wings."", u""Despite the film's title and marketing, there are actually nine characters that share the cabin during the blizzard. Absent from the list of eight characters in the film's marketing is O.B., the wagon driver. There are ten, if you count Channing Tatum's character Jody, who is hiding under the floorboards. Tatum's character wasn't in any of the marketing trailers, because Tarantino, Tatum, and the whole cast wanted to keep it a secret."", u""At one point in the film, Tim Roth's character is shot in the stomach and bleeding out in a confined space with people around him questioning his loyalty, very similar to his character's arc from Reservoir Dogs (1992)."", u'In the original screenplay, the presence of rats in the basement, was a common occurrence in the haberdashery. Throughout the screenplay, the sound of rats fighting each other, occurs several times, and was often a topic of conversation. Also, Jody Domergue was not immediately shot dead after he came out of the basement. In the screenplay, he was shot but not killed, and the rats would eventually eat him alive. The rats were completely discarded, and were not in either of the movie versions.', u'Every one of the main eight characters (Warren, Ruth, Domergue, Mannix, Bob, Mobray, Gage, and General Smithers) is shot.', u""In the original script, the ending was written much differently than what was shown on screen. After Joe Gage reveals himself, as the man who poisoned the coffee, Mannix holds Gage at the table at gunpoint, and threatens to shoot him if he doesn't drink the rest of the coffee; Gage refuses. Warren calls out Bob, Oswaldo, and Joe Gage and suggest that they are all in cahoots with Daisy. Bob and Oswaldo draw out their guns; Mannix shoots Bob dead, and Warren shoots Oswaldo in the abdomen; he falls to the floor screaming in pain. This is the cue for Jody to act from underneath the floorboards; he shoots up at Warren's crotch. As Mannix is caught off-guard and distracted for a few seconds, Joe Gage draws his gun and shoots at both Warren and Mannix, hitting them both in the back. Warren and Mannix return fire and kill Joe Gage. Jody comes up from the basement and shoots Warren a second time; Warren falls to the floor immobilized. Jody and Mannix engage in a brutal gunfight, striking one another with several bullets until Jody falls back in the basement dead. Meanwhile, Daisy manages to free herself from John Ruth's handcuffs; she crawls across the floor, snatches one of Warren's pistols and shoots Warren three times in the head, finally killing him. She almost gets to Mannix with the pistol, when Mannix suddenly grabs John Ruth's Winchester gun and shoots her dead. Oswaldo stops moving and dies. Mannix, shocked and fatally wounded, drops the gun, limps over to Sweet Dave's chair, and waits to die alone as the roaring of the winter blizzard continues on from outside."", u'Body Count: Sixteen. However, it is brought to an even twenty, if Chester Charles Smithers, and the three bodies that Major Marquis Warren have with him, when hitching a ride with John ""The Hangman"" Ruth\'s stagecoach, are included.', u""Channing Tatum's casting as Jody Domergue, could be viewed as an homage by Quentin Tarantino to Sergio Leone's Once Upon a Time in the West (1968), where Leone cast Henry Fonda as the primary antagonist. At that time, Fonda had been known for playing heroic characters, and he accepted the role after Leone described Fonda's character gunning down a child, and how the audience would be shocked by the scene. This film marks the first time Tatum, known for playing romantic or heroic roles, played a cold-blooded killer... unless you count Public Enemies (2009)"", u'When Jody fires his gun up at Warren, he shouts, ""Say adi\xf3s to your huevos!"" which is Spanish for ""Say goodbye to your eggs!"" literally, or in slang, ""Say goodbye to your balls!"" This is also a reference to the scene in Inglourious Basterds (2009), where Sergeant Stiglitz says, ""Say auf Wiedersehen to your Nazi balls"", before shooting a Nazi officer in the groin.', u'In the earlier drafts of the script, the character of ""Charly"" was written to be a young orphan boy, whose parents were supposedly slaves, and were possibly murdered, thus making his demise at the hands of the ruthless Domergue gang much more depressing and tragic. His death scene was also originally supposed to be more brutal and violent. Quentin Tarantino allegedly scrapped the idea, and made Charly an adult character instead.', u""According to the earliest draft of the script, the scene where Major Warren interrogates Bob, Oswaldo, and Joe Gage about working with Daisy, and poisoning the coffee, was originally supposed to be more brutal and disturbing than what was shown on film. Instead of simply threatening to pour the rest of the poisoned coffee down Daisy's throat, Warren was written to violently beat her, hold her at gunpoint, and then prepares to shoot her in the head, until Joe Gage finally intervenes. This scene also had more dialogue."", u""There are many theories regarding the true authenticity of Major Marquis Warren's claims to General Sandy Smithers about the torture, assault, and death of his son. Many fans do agree that it is true that Warren did, in fact, kill his son, but actually did so in self-defense (since, after all, he had a bounty on his head from the entire South) and didn't torture him in the way he said he did. Warren may have very well embellished the story to anger Smithers enough, so he would try to pick up the gun and shoot him. Some fans speculate that Warren may have never even been responsible for the death of Smither's son at all, but simply made the entire story up to anger and enrage the General. Quentin Tarantino has obviously left viewers to make their own interpretations."", u'In one of the earlier drafts of the script, the character of Oswaldo Mobray, was written to appear entirely innocent until towards the climax. During the first major shoot-out between Jody and Mannix, an unarmed Oswaldo is shot in the chest by a panicking, trigger-happy Mannix, thus making the audience first speculate that he was merely an innocent bystander, with no connections to Daisy.', u'In the final scene, Warren and Daisy believe everyone to be dead. It\'s revealed that Chris is still alive, when he says, ""I ain\'t dead yet, you black bastard."" This is most definitely an homage to, and modified version of, the famous line ""I ain\'t dead yet, you bushwhacker"" uttered by Le Boeuf in True Grit (1969). Both lines reveal a character to be alive, who was previously thought dead, who ""saves the day"".', u'At the end of the movie, when Major Marquis Warren is tying off the noose to the bedpost, he ties what is known as a ""clove hitch."" This is a perfect application of this knot. It is often used to tie off tent stakes, or a boat to a pier.', u""DIRECTOR_TRADEMARK(Quentin Tarantino): [long monologue before a sudden violent eruption]: Major Marquis Warren's extensive account of him killing Chester Charles Smithers before he kills Smithers' father."", u'Although there was a cat in the cabin during the flashback massacre, it was not revealed what happened to the cat, but he obviously disappeared.', u""When Daisy and John Ruth enter Minnie's Habadashery for the first time, while they're nailing the door shut in the background, General Smithers looks directly at the camera several times. A subtle wink to repeat viewers that things are not what they seem inside Minnie's."", u'According to the first draft of the script, the character of Jody Domergue was originally written to be an older man with a huskier build, dark hair, and gritty features; a major contrast from the more slender-framed, youthful-looking, blue-eyed, and light-haired Channing Tatum.', u""This film has similarities to Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs (1992). In the latter, a group of men believe that there is a rat in the group. However in this film, there's more than one person scheming."", u'Quentin Tarantino: [characters with a high off-screen body count] General Sandy Smithers and John Ruth are notorious for having executed and killed many people, but neither of the two kills anyone on-screen.', u'The plot is very similar to Rawhide (1951), in which outlaws take over a stagecoach way station.

Quentin Tarantino previously used this line in Kill Bill: Vol. 2 (2004).', u'In the finished draft of the script, the character of Billy Crash was written to be much more brutal and sadistic. A scene of him raping and tormenting Broomhilda in his cabin was cut from the final film. His original death from Django was also much different. Instead of shooting Crash to death at the end, Django takes a large knife and throws it at his chest as he leaves his cabin after his assault on Broomhilda.', u""In the final draft of the script, Stephen was written to be a more brutal character; in the barn scene after Django was captured at Candie's mansion, he was supposed to torture Django by burning off his nipples with a hot poker.

This particular verse refers to God giving all the beasts of the earth into man\'s hand: in the slave culture, black people were considered beasts, not fellow men.', u'Despite Quentin Tarantino writing the role of Django specifically for Will Smith, he untimely decided to pass on the film due to him seeing the character as not being the lead. He told Entertainment Weekly, ""Django wasn\'t the lead, so it was like, I need to be the lead. The other character was the lead! I was like, \'No, Quentin, please, I need to kill the bad guy!\'... I thought it was brilliant. Just not for me.""', u'The final showdown with Django and the hillbilly trackers was written to be entirely different. Mr. Stonesipher, the head of the trackers, was originally to be a stronger, and more threatening villain to Django. There was a scene written in the final draft of the script with Django killing the trackers with an axe. He then faces Mr. Stonesipher, and the two engage in hand-to-hand combat, with Stonesipher nearly defeating Django, but eventually losing.', u'Samuel L.

An extra smaller explosion was added in post production while Jamie Foxx is walking away from the buildings burning remains to cover the segment of Micalizzi\'s song ""Sleepy type guy"" that was uttered to describe the main character of the song. This segment was an accurate description for the character of ""Trinity"" from the 1970 spaghetti western They Call Me Trinity (1970) which this song was written for. This phrase was used due to the character\'s introduction of sleeping and being towed across the desert in a makeshift bed tied behind his horse. However this quote did not match the character of Django, who is never seen to rest throughout Django Unchained (2012). Hence the cover up of this segment of the song, that would have caused some confusion.', u""Quentin Tarantino: [victim's viewpoint] Lil' Raj Brittle's viewpoint is shown before Django kills him."", u'Early in the film Christoph Waltz kills a town sheriff, and is about to be arrested by the local U.S. Marshal, until he pulls out an arrest warrant for the man he has just killed.

One example of this can be found in the English subtitles of characters speaking in a foreign language. Occasionally, the foreign word is inserted into the subtitle.

Instead of the word ""Yes"" appearing in the subtitle, the word ""Oui"" appears, despite the fact that the rest of the French dialogue is translated to English.', u'At his audition in Berlin, Michael Fassbender inquired about playing Colonel Hans Landa.

Murnau, including The Last Laugh (1922), and Faust (1926). In 1927, Jannings moved to Hollywood to star in American movies. In 1928, he became the very first winner of the Academy Award for Best Actor (and the first person to ever receive an Academy Award) for his work in The Way of All Flesh (1927), and The Last Command (1928). But his Hollywood career ended when talkies came in, as Jannings\' thick German accent made him difficult to understand. Jannings returned to Germany, where he co-starred with Marlene Dietrich in The Blue Angel (1930). During the Third Reich era, Jannings starred in numerous films intended to promote Nazism, including Der Herrscher (1937), Ohm Kr\xfcger (1941), and Bismarck\'s Dismissal (1942). Minister of Propoaganda Joseph Goebbels named Jannings as ""Artist of the State."" (In ""Inglourious Basterds,"" Goebbels has Jannings show Zoller the ring given for this award, which Goebbels calls ""the highest artistic honor that I give."")

(English Title: ""The Inglorious Bastards"". The Italian title literally translates as ""That Cursed Armored Train"".). Castellari returned the favor by calling his new movie Caribbean Basterds (2010).', u'There was a real unit known as ""Masters\' Bastards"" in World War II. Apart from the obvious rhyming, they earned the name due in part to their fearsome reputation against the Japanese, much like the fictional \'Basterds\' in Europe.', u'The large Nazi eagle displayed in the theater lobby is based on a bronze eagle that was in the Reichs Chancellery in Berlin, by Kurt Schmid-Ehmen. The original Berlin eagle is now in the U.S. Air Force Museum in Dayton, Ohio.', u'The character of Kliest is only present as a telephone voice, spoken by the German actor Christian Br\xfcckner. Similarly, the character of the OSS Commander is only heard as a voice on the radio, played by Harvey Keitel. Christian Br\xfcckner provided the German dubbing voice for Harvey Keitel in Pulp Fiction (1994).', u'Despite being described as the one who ""speaks the least Italian,"" of the three Basterds to enter the movie theater impersonating Italian film makers, it is Private First Class Ulmer who has the most believable Italian accent.', u""The name of Til Schweiger's character, Sergeant Hugo Stiglitz, is an homage to Mexican B-movie actor Hugo Stiglitz."", u'One of the movie posters shows a bloody German helmet dangling from an equally bloody baseball bat.

In this film, he plays the leader of a group that scalps German soldiers and mentions a past involvement in bootlegging.', u'Cloris Leachman originally appeared in the film as Mrs. Himmelstein, an elderly Jewish woman living in Boston. Although filmed, the scenes featuring Mrs. Himmelstein drinking tea with Donny Donowitz (and signing his trademark baseball bat afterward) were cut from the final film.

However, Harvey denied this rumor, stating that Tarantino was reorganizing some scenes since he didn't have enough time to completely finish editing the film before sending it to Cannes, since he was given only six weeks to edit, whereas other directors are given normally six months to a year.

According to an interview Tarantino conducted with Ron Bennington, Donny is Lee\'s father.', u""Christoph Waltz's first week on set was also his first scene in the film."", u'Mike Myers (as General Ed Fenech), a fan of Quentin Tarantino, had inquired about being in the film since Myers\' parents had been in the British Armed Forces. In terms of the character\'s dialect, Myers felt that it was a version of Received Pronunciation meeting the officer class, but mostly an attitude of ""I\'m fed up with this war and if this dude can end it, great, because my country is in ruins.""', u""The role of Francesca Mondino was written especially for Julie Dreyfus, who played a similar character in Quentin Tarantino's previous movie, Kill Bill: Vol. 1 (2003)."", u'Tom Tykwer translated the parts of the script that were to be in German.', u'The paperback book Shoshanna is reading in the caf\xe9 before Zoller comes in is apparently a French edition of Leslie Charteris\' ""The Saint in New York"" (first published in 1934). This novel is remarkable in the Saint canon for being extremely grim and violent: the debonair crime-fighter shows a cold and ruthless side as he executes a number of gangland killers in revenge for a murder - something like the mission which Lieutenant Raine explains at the start of the film.', u'During his recruiting monologue near the beginning of the movie, Lieutenant Aldo Raine states that he\'s a descendant of ""the mountain man Jim Bridger,"" who really did have Native American wives. Consequently, his nickname is ""Aldo the Apache."" In reality, none of Bridger\'s three Indian wives were Apache (they were, in order, Flathead, Ute, and Shoshone).', u'This is the second film that Brad Pitt and Diane Kruger have appeared in together.

The title has the swastika removed and the steel helmet has a bullet hole instead of the Nazi symbol. The German site\'s download section was revised to exclude wallpaper downloads that openly feature the swastika. Though the advertisement posters and wallpapers may not show Nazi iconography, this does not apply to ""works of art"" according to German law, so the film itself is not censored in Germany.', u'None of the weapons used by the Basterds are American, befitting their status as a clandestine group of military assassins in occupied enemy territory. B.J.

In February, 1945, three O.S.S. agents - Frederick Mayer (a German-born American spy), Hans Wijnberg (a Dutch-born agent who, like Mayer, was Jewish), and Franz Weber (a former Austrian Wehrmacht officer) - were parachuted into Austria. For several months, Mayer gathered intelligence on the Germans\' ""Alpine Fortress,"" by posing as a Nazi officer and as a French electrician. While staying with Weber\'s family in Innsbruck, Wijnberg and Weber radioed the intelligence back to OSS operatives in Bari, Italy. When Mayer\'s cover was blown by a black marketer, he was captured and tortured by the Gestapo, but refused to give up the other two agents. However, General Franz Hofer, commander of the Nazi forces in western Austria, realized the war was lost and was looking for a way to surrender his forces to the Allies, instead of to the Red Army. He had Mayer brought to his home, and offered to send a message for him to the O.S.S. offices in Bern, Switzerland, through a German agent. Mayer helped negotiate the surrender of Germany\'s Austria forces, which took place in Innsbruck on May 3, 1945. Afterwards, Mayer and Wijnberg returned to America.

However, French, German civilian (von Hammersmark) and American and Brit (except when acting as Germans) characters refer to the SS characters by the Heer rank equivalents of Colonel/ Oberst, Major, Captain/ Hauptmann, Senior Lieutenant/ Oberleutnant.Regardless of the title spoken, the subtitles always use Heer ranks in English.', u'Well known German actor Moritz Bleibtreu was originally cast as a part for the bar scene, but had to cancel, because of time scheduling problems.', u'Diane Kruger and Brad Pitt were both in Troy (2004).', u'Til Schweiger and Brad Pitt both acted alongside Shia LaBeouf in Fury (2015) and Charlie Countryman (2013).', u'In 2008, Til Schweiger (Sergeant Hugo Stiglitz) appeared alongside Johannes Heester (better known as the favorite actor of Adolph Hitler) in the film 1 1/2 Knights: In Search of the Ravishing Princess Herzelinde (2008).', u'In the scene where Shoshanna films her part in Nation\'s Pride, Marcel films her at an angle upwards towards the top of a stairway.

Quentin Tarantino was unimpressed with choking scenes in other movies, in that actors are rarely in any considerable danger while shooting them, and convinced Kruger to be strangled for real in order to get the scene just right. Fearing that actor Christoph Waltz would choke her too much or too little, Tarantino decided to literally take matters into his own hands and did the scene himself. In an interview, Tarantino said, ""What I said to her was, I\'m gonna just strangle you, alright? Full on, I\'m gonna cut off your air, for just a little bit of time. We\'re gonna see the reaction in your face and I\'m gonna yell cut."" Kruger decided this was reasonable and let Tarantino sit on top of her and choke her to the point of unconsciousness.

During tests, the flame temperatures reached 400 degrees Celsius, and during the take, the set burned out of control and the temperature of the ceiling above them reached 1,200 degrees Celsius (2,000 degrees Fahrenheit.) Quentin Tarantino was seated on a crane operating the camera in a fireproof suit, and none of them wanted to back down and ruin the shot.

The script hints that Raine survived a lynching, a common punishment in the 1920s and 1930s, but otherwise, it explicitly states that the scar will never be explained."", u'Quentin Tarantino had all of the actors playing the Basterds go through a day of ""scalping training"" in preparation for the movie, and told them that the three best practice scalpers would be rewarded with close-ups of them doing just that in the film. One of these moments comes in the very last scene, when Private First Class Utivich scalps Landa\'s driver after Aldo shoots him.', u'Despite his reputation and being leader of the Basterds, Aldo Raine is only seen killing one person on-screen (At the end when he shoots the radio operator).', u'The giant swastika falling down in the final scene is real. It was a mistake that happened on the set.', u'In earlier drafts of the screenplay, Shosanna was a much more active member of the French resistance, sniping at soldiers from rooftops, and even compiling a death list of high ranking Nazi officials to cross off. But when Quentin Tarantino did his ""Kill Bill"" movies, he worked those plot details into that story, and decided it was redundant, so instead, he decided to make Shosanna a more realistic character, and have her keep a low profile.', u""Chapter Three is the only chapter throughout the movie where someone doesn't die, and the only chapter where English is not spoken."", u""The shooting script includes a scene where Raine and his men intimidate the veterinarian into treating Bridget Von Hammersmark's bullet wound by shooting two of the dogs inside their cages.

However, in the film, Hirschberg only speaks one line, and he disappears before the closing scenes with his fate being left unresolved. In interviews, Samm Levine confirms that Hirschberg survives to the story's end, and written-but-not-filmed closing scenes had him, and other unspecified Basterds, meeting up with Lieutenant Raine and Private First Class Utivich after they settled things with Colonel Landa."", u'The scene with Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz ) placing the high-heeled shoe on Bridget von Hammersmark\'s (Diane Kruger ) foot is a twisted reference to the fairy tale ""Cinderella"". In the story, the prince identifies Cinderella by making her try on the glass slipper she lost at the ball. Here, Landa identifies von Hammersmark as the double-agent by making her try on the heel she lost in the bar-fight.', u""The standoff between Aldo and Sergeant Wilhelm during the LaLouisiane scene is similar to a scene in Quentin Tarantino's other movie Kill Bill: Vol. 2 (2004) in which The Bride just finds out she is pregnant and is attacked by a hit woman. The two have a standoff in which she makes a deal with the hit woman to let her go as she is pregnant. Sergeant Wilhelm makes a deal with Aldo to let him go as he had become a father that night. The difference in the two scenarios is that The Bride honors the deal and the hitwoman escapes, while Aldo honors the deal but Bridget von Hammersmark shoots and kills Sergeant Wilhelm."", u'Quentin Tarantino continues his tradition of ripping on waiters in this film, by killing the French barmaid in the LaLouisiane tavern shoot-out. (Only two waiters are on screen in the film, the barmaid being the only one featured exclusively.)', u'Despite the similarity between the small role of Harvey Keitel in this film, and his role in Pulp Fiction (1994), Eli Roth confirmed that his character is not ""The Wolf"" in this film. He jokingly added that Samuel L.

In many cases separate footage was composited in post-production to look as if it were all shot the same day. For example: Marv (Mickey Rourke) takes Wendy (Jaime King) to Nancy's (Jessica Alba) house. Alba had not been cast yet when Rourke and King shot the scene; her footage was added in later. The same is true of the scenes between Marv, Cardinal Roark (Rutger Hauer), and Kevin (Elijah Wood), as Hauer and Wood were cast after Rourke had shot his scenes."", u'Directors Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller planned each shot in the movie by using the panels from the original book as storyboard.', u'Robert Rodriguez, who credits Frank Miller\'s visual style in the comic as being as relevant as his own in the film, insisted that Miller receive a ""co-director"" credit with him. The Directors\' Guild of America would not allow it. As a result, Rodriguez resigned from the DGA, saying, ""It was easier for me to quietly resign before shooting because otherwise I\'d be forced to make compromises I was unwilling to make or set a precedent that might hurt the guild later on."" Unfortunately, by resigning from the DGA, Rodriguez was also forced to relinquish his director\'s seat on the film John Carter (2012) (at the time ""A Princess of Mars"" after the book on which it was based) for Paramount.

While the other movies (Immortal (2004), Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow (2004), and Casshern (2004) - two of which were shot on film) were shot first, this movie\'s use of High-Definition digital cameras (like ""Sky Captain"") in addition to the ""backlot"" method makes Sin City one of the world\'s first ""fully-digital"" live action motion pictures.', u'When Jackie Boy and his ""troops"" enter Shellie\'s apartment, one of them is wearing a t-shirt with a peace sign embedded with a star and flag (the symbol also appears as one of Becky\'s (Alexis Bledel) earrings).

According to Robert Rodriguez, Nick Stahl (who plays Yellow Bastard) was known on set as ""The Blue Bastard"". Yellow Bastard had to be painted blue because yellow, like green, reacts with the green screen. This causes the color to spill into the background, making them impossible to separate.', u'The strategy used by Dwight to reclaim Old Town by luring the gangsters into a narrow alleyway is based on the strategy used by Spartan King Leonidas to trap the Persian army in the Battle of Thermopylae. The film 300 (2006) was based on a book by Frank Miller about this battle. In addition, the line spoken in Dwight\'s internal monologue, ""No escape, no surrender, no mercy"", is spoken by the narrator in ""300.""', u""The scene that Quentin Tarantino directed is the drive to the pits scene in which Dwight (Clive Owen) talks with a very dead Jackie Boy (Benicio Del Toro).

This is very similar to a scene from Die Hard, which stars Willis, in which the main character is trapped under a table by a henchman shooting towards him and the henchman telling him not to allow anyone to live the next time he encounters a henchman, to which Willis kills the henchman while laying down under the table and commenting ""Thanks for the advice.""']","[u'USA::28 March 2005 (Westwood, California)\n (premiere)', u'Canada::1 April 2005', u'USA::1 April 2005', u'Trinidad and Tobago::20 April 2005', u'New Zealand::12 May 2005', u'France::18 May 2005 (Cannes Film Festival)', u'Latvia::20 May 2005', u'Israel::26 May 2005', u'Thailand::26 May 2005', u'Estonia::27 May 2005', u'Taiwan::27 May 2005', u'Finland::28 May 2005 (Helsinki) (limited)', u'Belgium::1 June 2005', u'Switzerland::1 June 2005 (French speaking region)', u'France::1 June 2005', u'Italy::1 June 2005', u'Philippines::1 June 2005', u'Hong Kong::2 June 2005', u'Hungary::2 June 2005', u'Netherlands::2 June 2005', u'Russia::2 June 2005', u'Bulgaria::3 June 2005', u'Switzerland::3 June 2005 (Italian speaking region)', u'Denmark::3 June 2005', u'UK::3 June 2005', u'Ireland::3 June 2005', u'Kazakhstan::4 June 2005', u'Portugal::9 June 2005', u'Poland::10 June 2005', u'Finland::18 June 2005 (Midnight Sun Film Festival)', u'Croatia::23 June 2005', u'South Korea::30 June 2005', u'Sweden::1 July 2005', u'Iceland::8 July 2005', u'Lebanon::8 July 2005', u'Norway::8 July 2005', u'Czech Republic::9 July 2005 (Karlovy Vary Film Festival)', u'Australia::14 July 2005', u'Singapore::14 July 2005', u'Turkey::15 July 2005', u'Czech Republic::21 July 2005', u'Brazil::22 July 2005 (Rio de Janeiro)\n (premiere)', u'Finland::22 July 2005', u'Greece::22 July 2005', u'Mexico::22 July 2005', u'Slovakia::28 July 2005', u'Brazil::29 July 2005', u'Germany::30 July 2005 (M\xfcnchen Fantasy Filmfest)', u'Argentina::4 August 2005', u'Peru::4 August 2005', u'Austria::11 August 2005', u'Germany::11 August 2005', u'Spain::12 August 2005', u'Panama::12 August 2005', u'Switzerland::18 August 2005 (German speaking region)', u'Romania::9 September 2005', u'Republic of Macedonia::23 September 2005', u'Japan::1 October 2005', u'South Africa::7 October 2005', u'Egypt::30 November 2005 (Cairo International Film Festival)', u""USA::13 December 2005 (director's cut)"", u'Kazakhstan::28 June 2010 (Astana International Action Film Festival)']",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

In the final film, however, Beatrix Kiddo leaves Elle Driver alive."", u'It is a common fan theory that Samuel L. Jackson\'s character of Rufus, the piano playing drifter, is actually Jules Winfield, from Pulp Fiction (1994). At the end of Pulp Fiction, Jules says he wants to ""Become a drifter, and walk the earth."" In Kill Bill Vol. 2, Rufus at one point says ""I was a drifter..."" while telling his story in the church. However, there is no proof to this theory, because when Rufus says ""I was a drifter,"" he also says ""I was a Coaster, and I was a Temptation. If they came through Texas, I played with them,"" inferring that he played back-up for the bands The Drifters, The Coasters, and The Temptations."" Whether or not Rufus is actually Jules Winfield, telling tall tales, only Tarantino knows for sure.', u'Throughout both parts, Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) and Budd (Michael Madsen) are the only fellow assassins that Beatrix Kiddo does not cite as having ""unfinished business"" with her. She kills neither.', u""The climax of the film was originally written as a sword-fight on the beach, under the moonlight, between Beatrix (clad in her wedding dress) and Bill.

Her name is actually spoken or revealed on more than one occasion. When someone calls her Beatrix and it\'s bleeped, it is simply muffled and is still audible, and if you\'re good at reading lips, you may be able to figure it out. Also, Bill refers to The Bride as ""Kiddo"" in the flashback scenes. While this is both his pet name for her, and a common term of endearment, it is also her last name.', u'During the scene, in which Bill shoots the bride with truth serum, and then interrogates her, he calls her a ""natural born killer"" and also a ""renegade killer bee,"" which references projects of the Wu-Tang Clan, a member of which (RZA) wrote much of the original music for the two films.', u'In the original script, the fight between Beatrix Kiddo and Elle Driver was supposed to resemble her fight with O-Ren Ishii. Quentin Tarantino revealed in an interview with Entertainment Weekly that he changed it the day after catching a showing of Jackass: The Movie (2002) at the Alamo Drafthouse in Austin, Texas.', u'During the end credits, the names of actors and actresses playing characters on The Bride\'s ""Death List Five"" list are crossed off, that is, those characters who die on-screen. In order, as per the ""Death List Five"", it is Lucy Liu (O-Ren Ishii), Vivica A. Fox (Vernita Green), and Michael Madsen (Budd). However, a question mark appears over Daryl Hannah (Elle), since it is technically unknown as to her condition, though, being now completely blind, heavily bleeding from her (second) destroyed eye, and being in the middle of the desert, she has very little, or no, hope to survive. David Carradine (Bill), who dies on-screen, has his name appear before the aforementioned cast members, yet his name is not crossed off.', u""In an interview, Quentin Tarantino stated that there will be a Kill Bill: Vol 3, but it wouldn't happen for a decade, and he also discussed the possibility of a spin-off centering around Vernita Green's daughter Nikki, who seeks vengeance upon The Bride. The plot of Kill Bill: Vol 3 could possibly be about The Bride, who is forced to return to her former violent life, when Nikki Green kidnaps her daughter BB, in order to lure The Bride into a deadly trap, and The Bride learns Nikki is not acting alone, and is working with Elle Driver, now a blind swordswoman."", u'Esteban Vihaio (Michael Parks) explains to Beatrix, that Bill is passionate about blonde women, after seeing Lana Turner in The Postman Always Rings Twice (1946), that he saw with Vihaio when he was six years old.

This is why the trailers for this film (and similarly for every film released in the U.S. thereafter) feature The Bride\'s clothes covered in blackish-brown stains where the blood would be.

While, at least three notable references originate from Chan's 1976 film, Shaolin Wooden Men (1976): Pai Mai's introduction scene references the stairway and water training scene; Pai Mai himself though in white in Kill Bill is the blind orange master monk (who in Kill Bill blinds Elle); and, finally, the five point finger exploding hand technique comes from the end battle scene of Shaolin Wooden Men where the villain uses a special punch technique on the protagonists but is only able to deliver 4 of the 5 blows (with the protagonist holding his heart, as Bill does, right before dying).""]","[u'USA::29 September 2003 (Hollywood, California)\n (premiere)', u'Germany::1 October 2003 (Berlin)\n (premiere)', u'UK::2 October 2003 (London)\n (premiere)', u'USA::7 October 2003 (New York City, New York)\n (premiere)', u'Canada::10 October 2003', u'Czech Republic::10 October 2003', u'UK::10 October 2003 (London)', u'Slovakia::10 October 2003', u'USA::10 October 2003', u'Ireland::13 October 2003 (Cork International Film Festival)', u'Austria::16 October 2003', u'Australia::16 October 2003', u'Switzerland::16 October 2003 (German speaking region)', u'Germany::16 October 2003', u'Hong Kong::16 October 2003', u'Hungary::16 October 2003', u'New Zealand::16 October 2003', u'UK::17 October 2003', u'Ireland::17 October 2003', u'Iceland::17 October 2003', u'Poland::17 October 2003', u'Singapore::17 October 2003\n (premiere)', u'Norway::18 October 2003 (Bergen International Film Festival)', u'Japan::19 October 2003 (Tokyo)\n (premiere)', u'Singapore::23 October 2003', u'Denmark::24 October 2003', u'Finland::24 October 2003', u'Italy::24 October 2003', u'Norway::24 October 2003', u'Portugal::24 October 2003', u'Taiwan::24 October 2003', u'Japan::25 October 2003', u'Belgium::29 October 2003', u'Israel::30 October 2003', u'Spain::November 2003 (Sitges Film Festival)', u'Serbia::1 November 2003', u'France::4 November 2003 (Paris)\n (premiere)', u'Malta::5 November 2003', u'Colombia::14 November 2003', u'Sweden::14 November 2003 (Stockholm International Film Festival)', u'Venezuela::19 November 2003', u'Netherlands::20 November 2003', u'Greece::21 November 2003', u'South Korea::21 November 2003', u'Switzerland::26 November 2003 (French speaking region)', u'France::26 November 2003', u'Argentina::27 November 2003', u'Mexico::28 November 2003', u'Uruguay::28 November 2003', u'Sweden::3 December 2003', u'Russia::4 December 2003', u'Chile::5 December 2003', u'Panama::5 December 2003', u'Estonia::26 December 2003', u'Bahrain::31 December 2003', u'Egypt::31 December 2003', u'Turkey::2 January 2004', u'Philippines::14 January 2004', u'Kuwait::20 January 2004', u'Romania::30 January 2004', u'Spain::5 March 2004', u'Brazil::23 April 2004', u'France::28 April 2004 (re-release)', u'Bulgaria::1 October 2004', u'Croatia::11 December 2004', u'Indonesia::22 March 2005 (TV premiere)', u'Switzerland::8 August 2009 (Locarno Film Festival)', u'Sweden::7 November 2014 (Stockholm International Film Festival)', u'Chile::25 March 2015 (FEMCINE, Festival Cine de Mujeres)']",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Not until season eleven, did the show reveal that Weaver\'s condition was congenital hip dysplasia. But in 2006, not long before Innes left the show, the showrunners decided to have Weaver undergo surgery that would eliminate the limp and the need for the crutch. This was because Laura Innes had started to experience some real-life medical problems from her decade of playing Weaver with a limp. Innes told a reporter, ""My real back was getting screwed up.

Calderon ended up with a small role, as Paul.', u'In an interview with James Lipton on Inside the Actors Studio (1994), John Travolta went into details of the many obstacles of tackling his role as Vincent Vega, the most challenging being that of how he was going to show the essence of his character as that of a heroin addict. Never using the drug himself, Quentin Tarantino had Travolta research his character\'s addiction by speaking to a recovering heroin addict that he (Quentin) knew personally. Travolta asked Tarantino\'s friend to tell him how could he know what it felt like to be on heroin (without actually using it of course). Tarantino\'s friend explained ""If you want to get the \'bottom envelope\' feeling of that, get plastered on Tequila, and lie down in a hot pool. Then you will have barely touched the feeling of what it might be like to be on heroin."" John Travolta then explained that he was ecstatic to tell his wife that he was ""told"" in order to research aspects of his upcoming roles\' character, he had to get plastered on Tequila and lie in a hot pool. He stated she happily joined him at the hotel hot tub which had shots of Tequila lined from end to end on the railings to assist him in his ""research"".', u'This film was selected for preservation in the Library of Congress National Film Registry.', u'The passage from the Bible that Jules has memorized was mostly made up by Quentin Tarantino and Samuel L. Jackson. The only part that\'s similar to what the Bible says is the part where he says, ""And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger. And you will know My name is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee."" However, the parts about the righteous man and the shepherd are not real. It\'s likely that Tarantino actually included it as a reference to the Sonny Chiba film Karate Kiba (1976) as the quote is almost word for word from the opening scene. Tarantino has also said that he is big fan of the actor and is therefore likely to have seen the movie.', u'Quentin Tarantino wrote ""The Wolf"" character specifically for Harvey Keitel.', u'The parts of ""Honey Bunny"" and ""Pumpkin"" were written specifically for Amanda Plummer and Tim Roth.', u""Jules flipping the table over in the beginning was improvised by Samuel L. Jackson, and Frank Whaley's reaction was genuine, but they continued with the scene, and it was done in one take."", u""The role of Vincent Vega was originally (and exclusively) written with Michael Madsen firmly in mind. Quentin Tarantino had been working on his script for seven months and, even though Madsen knew of Quentin's plans and had expressed his desire to play the part, Madsen had already signed up for the role of Virgil Earp in Wyatt Earp (1994), and was unable to commit to the film. He later regretted the decision."", u'Speculation abounds as to the nature of the mysterious glowing contents of the case (which Tarantino said was simply a MacGuffin plot device): Could it be Elvis\'s gold suit, seen worn by Val Kilmer (as Elvis) in True Romance (1993)?The most persistent theory is that it is Marcellus Wallace\'s soul. The story goes that when the Devil takes a person\'s soul, it is removed through the back of the head. When we see the back of Marcellus\'s head he has a Band-Aid covering the precise spot indicated by tradition for soul removal. Perhaps Marcellus sold his soul to the devil which would also explain why the combination to open the briefcase is 666.Quentin Tarantino has said that the band-aid on the back of Marsellus Wallace\'s neck had nothing to do with an allusion to the Devil stealing Marsellus\'s soul... but that the actor Ving Rhames had a scar on the back of his neck he wanted to cover up.According to Roger Avary, who co-wrote the script with Quentin Tarantino, the original plan was to have the briefcase contain diamonds (urban legend has it that they were the diamonds from Resevoir Dogs). This seemed neither exciting nor original, so Avary and Tarantino decided to have the briefcase\'s contents never appear on screen; this way each film-goer could mentally ""fill in the blank"" with whatever struck his or her imagination as best fitting the description ""so beautiful"". The orange light bulb (projecting shimmering light onto the actors\' faces) was a last-minute decision and added a completely unintended fantastic element. In a radio interview with Howard Stern in late 2003, Quentin Tarantino was asked by a caller the contents of the briefcase, and he answered, ""It\'s whatever the viewer wants it to be.""', u'Chandler Lindauer had to sit through the Captain Koons speech delivered by Christopher Walken. Because of his young age, he had no clue what Walken was saying, including the use of adult language.', u'When Vincent calls Lance on his cell phone, Lance is eating a bowl of Fruit Brute, a cereal from the older monster cereal family. Fruit Brute (which, along with Yummy Mummy, Frankenberry, Boo Berry, and Count Chocula, make up the monster cereals) was later discontinued, along with ""Yummy Mummy."" Quentin Tarantino has held onto a box and drops it into scenes from time to time. It appeared in Reservoir Dogs (1992), too.', u'Many people believe that the band-aid on Ving Rhames\' neck was an intentional choice by the filmmakers. In reality, it came from an accident Rhames had while shaving his head. When Quentin Tarantino noticed this, it inspired him to open the ""Vincent Vega and Marsellus Wallace"" sequence with a close-up of the band-aid instead. Ultimately Tarantino liked showing the band-aid rather than Rhames\' face because it accentuated the character\'s mercurial nature and was more visually exciting than a series of single shots of Rhames and Bruce Willis.', u""The dance that Vince (John Travolta) and Mia (Uma Thurman) perform at Jack Rabbit Slims was copied, movement by movement, from the dance performed early in Fellini's 1963 classic 8\xbd (1963) by Gloria Morin (Barbara Steele) and Mario Mezzabotta (Mario Pisu)."", u'The screenplay says that Zed and Maynard are brothers.', u'The role of Butch was originally supposed to be an up and coming boxer.

She bets Vincent that he is an ""Elvis"", and he confirms it. Tarantino says he removed the scene because of the film clich\xe9 of having one character film another with a handheld camera. It is also worth noting that Jules calls Pumpkin ""Ringo,"" as a reference to Ringo Starr, thus making him a Beatles person.', u'Vincent Vega is the only character who is present in every segment of the film: ""Vincent Vega and Marsellus Wallace\'s Wife"", ""The Gold Watch"", ""The Bonnie Situation"" and ""The Diner"".', u'The white 1980 Honda Civic which Butch is driving when he knocks down Marsellus Wallace is the same car as Jackie Brown later drove in the film Jackie Brown (1997) (1997).', u'Quentin Tarantino had originally intended ""My Sharona"" (by The Knack) to be played during the Gimp torture sequence, but the rights had already been licensed to another film, Reality Bites (1994).

Knowing that this would make the characters unlikeable, Travolta took his idea to Quentin Tarantino and he agreed to it, figuring that a single-bullet kill would be funnier.

Also, it was Mr. Pink who had the first lines about ""Like a Virgin."" This was when Quentin Tarantino still intended to play Mr. Pink himself.', u'When Mr. Pink has his speech about not tipping, he mentions that he once worked for minimum wage.

Earlier in the film, when Chris Penn starts talking about ""The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia"", Mr. Pink can be seen about to take a sip from his cup before realizing it\'s empty. He then looks for the waitress.', u'Mr. Pink\'s numerous references to being ""professional"" are a reference to movie director Howard Hawks, a favorite of Quentin Tarantino\'s.', u'In the first scene of the Mr. Blonde chapter, when Vic Vega is meeting with Joe and Nice Guy Eddie, he states that his parole officer is Seymour Scagnetti. This character may be related to the character Jack Scagnetti, the detective in Natural Born Killers (1994), which was also scripted by Quentin Tarantino.', u'In the French version, the line ""If you fucking beat this prick long enough, he\'ll tell you he started the goddamn Chicago fire"" was translated into ""he\'ll tell you he blew the bridge over the River Kwai"".', u'Was voted the second greatest directorial debut of all time behind Citizen Kane (1941).', u'During a screening at Sitges Film Festival, fifteen people walked out, including Wes Craven and special makeup effects artist Rick Baker. Baker later told Quentin Tarantino to take the walkout as a ""compliment"" and explained that he found the violence unnerving because of its heightened sense of realism. Tarantino commented about it at the time: ""It happens at every single screening. For some people the violence, or the rudeness of the language, is a mountain they can\'t climb. That\'s OK. It\'s not their cup of tea. But I am affecting them. I wanted that scene to be disturbing.""', u""While driving in the car, someone mentions Pam Grier.

According to Duchovny, Quentin Tarantino told him, ""I like what you do, I just don\'t know if I want you to do it in my movie.""', u'Of his decision to not show the heist itself, Quentin Tarantino has said that the reason was initially budgetary, but that he had always liked the idea of not showing it, and stuck with that idea in order to make the details of the heist ambiguous. He has said that the technique allows for the realization that the film is ""about other things""; a similar plot outline that appears in the stage play Glengarry Glen Ross (and its film adaptation) in which the mentioned robbery is never shown on camera. Tarantino has compared this to the work of a novelist, and has said that he wanted the film to be about something that is not seen, and that he wanted it to ""play with a real-time clock as opposed to a movie clock ticking"".', u'During the bathroom scene where Mr. White and Mr. Pink are discussing who is alive or dead, and specifically Mr. Blonde, there is a hint that Mr. Blonde is alive. Much like the white and pink shirts and the orange rag, the bathroom contains one other item hinting at a character. Behind Mr. White when he is doing his hair there is a yellow sink, suggesting Mr. Blonde is alive.', u'Jon Cryer was offered the role of Mr. Pink but he turned it down.

Hare reports that Keitel\'s character Mr. White and Madsen\'s Mr. Blonde illustrate the differences between the mental health diagnoses of sociopathy and psychopathy. Mr. White is a sociopath, a professional criminal who nonetheless has some loyalty and standards of conduct; he takes no pleasure in violence but regards the use of force as an occasional necessity in his vocation. In contrast, Mr. Blonde enjoys torturing the captured police officer; Mr. White explicitly describes Mr. Blonde as a ""psychopath"" and condemns his reckless shooting of civilians.', u""Both this film and Pulp Fiction (1994) have prologues featuring criminals at breakfast.

That role went to Bruce Willis, with whom Madsen later worked on Sin City (2005). Quentin Tarantino also worked with Willis two years later in Pulp Fiction (1994). Steve Buscemi also appears in Pulp Fiction, as a waiter who resembles Buddy Holly. He also worked with Willis on Armageddon (1998).', u'Seymour Cassel and Steve Buscemi went to the audition together.

This might be a nod to Quentin Tarantino\'s work with Lawrence Tierney in this film.', u'Oddly enough, in all the film\'s advertising, including posters and the theatrical trailer, Tim Roth is billed second while Michael Madsen receives the honorary ""and"" billing at the end of the roll call. However in the film itself, Madsen and Roth switch billings, as Madsen is now second, behind Harvey Keitel, and Roth with the ""and"" credit at the end.', u'Although Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth and Steve Buscemi all went on to appear in Quentin Tarantino\'s even more ambitious follow-up Pulp Fiction (1994), none of them shared a scene together.

The hilariously synthesized voice of \'Paul\', who narrates the text, says of Keitel selling shoes, ""But he didn\'t like the work. The mundanity and the monotony of it rapidly drove him wild"". In Reservoir Dogs (1992), Keitel, (as Mr. White), wears black shoes to match his suit. It\'s ironic that Keitel was a court sternograher, as this is part of law enforcement, given that he has a tendency to play criminals in his films quite often.', u'This is the second film where Michael Madsen tortures a man who is tied to a chair with a razorblade.

This is why anyone who smokes is smoking a pack of ""Red Apples"", a brand Tarantino made up. The exception in this movie is when Mr. White offers Mr. Pink a Chesterfield cigarette. (Additionally, any cereal in his films (Fruit Brute, Kabooom!, etc.) are all brands that died out in the 1970s and no longer exist.)', u'Quentin Tarantino: [long take] (at around 57 mins) While torturing the cop, we follow Mr. Blonde continuously from the warehouse to his car outside, back into the warehouse again.', u""Quentin Tarantino: [trunk] Before the audience sees the contents of Mr. Blonde's trunk, the camera looks up at Mr. White, Mr. Blonde, and Mr. Pink from inside the trunk."", u'The opening scene in the coffee shop contains subtle foreshadowing about the identity of the ""rat"". When Joe demands to know which crook didn\'t contribute to the tip, Mr. Orange is the one who snitches on Mr. Pink.', u'According to Quentin Tarantino, Mr. Pink does in fact survive. You can verify this by increasing the volume of the background sounds: When Mr. Pink runs out of the building with the diamonds, police officers can be heard shouting at him to put his hands on the ground. Gunshots can be heard, then Mr. Pink shouts that he has been shot. You can then hear the officers talking to each other as Pink is arrested.', u""Chris Penn's blood squibs accidentally went off too early in the big stand-off scene, forcing him to fall to the floor. There is not, as is commonly believed, a mystery round being fired off-screen."", u""The actress who plays the lady Mr. Orange shoots was Tim Roth's dialect coach. Roth insisted that she take the role, as she was very hard on him."", u'Although he supposedly killed more people than any of the other characters did, Mr. Blonde is never seen killing anyone on-screen.', u'In the scene where Nice Guy Eddie talks on his cell phone about the botched robbery, an orange balloon can be seen floating past the car. Some believe that this was intentional, as to foreshadow Mr. Orange as the rat. However, Quentin Tarantino claims that it was accidental.', u""According to cast member Edward Bunker, there was a scene that would have shown exactly what happened to his character, Mr. Blue but the scene was cut due to the limited budget. He also said actor Lawrence Tierney could never remember his lines, so Tierney's scenes took a while to shoot."", u'The promotional posters for ""Reservoir Dogs"" say ""Five strangers team up for the perfect crime..."". The criminals in the movie - Mr. Pink, Mr. White, Mr. Orange, Mr. Blonde, Mr. Brown and Mr. Blue - are in fact six strangers. It is possible it says 5 instead of 6 as Mr. Orange, being an undercover cop, would already know who the others are.', u'In the scene where Mr. Brown dies. Mr. White and Mr. Orange walk away from the car and as they are walking away you can see several crew members in the background behind a truck.', u'At the end of the scene where Mr. Orange is talking to the other undercover cop in Johnnies restaurant, they are talking about the comic character ""The Thing"" immediately after he says that it cuts to him in his apartment answering a phone. As he reaches to pick up the phone, he knocks over an action figure of Iron Man, and the action figure of the Thing is visible at the edge of the table.', u'The total death count in this film (onscreen and off) is at least 17. Four clerks in the jewelry store, five of the six crooks (Mr. White, Mr. Orange, Mr. Blonde, Mr. Blue, and Mr. Brown), Joe Cabot and his son Nice Guy Eddie, the two cops Mr. White shot, the cop in the trunk (Marvin Nash), the cop Mr. Pink shot, the woman Mr. Orange shot, and the ""black girl"" Mr. Blonde shoots in the bank. The number of police officers Mr. Blonde had to shoot to escape the jewelry store is not mentioned. It can be assumed that Mr. Pink is not shot after he flees the warehouse; although you hear gunshots, he can be heard very faintly yelling something to the effect of ""give up"" shortly thereafter.', u""When asked about Mr. Blue, Joe says that he is 'Dead as Dillinger.' Lawrence Tierney played the title character in Dillinger (1945)."", u'Many people have asked Quentin Tarantino why Mr. Orange confessed to being a cop to Mr. White at the end of the movie. They argued that he only had to keep quiet for 60 more seconds and he would be in the clear. He mentions this in the DVD commentary for the film. His response to these individuals is that they did not truly understand the movie, if they are asking this question. Tarantino says that in all the Asian countries that this movie was released in, this question was never once asked. He says that in Japan they have a word for this called ""jingi"". Without an English equivalent, it basically means that this was something that Mr. Orange HAD to do as a man. Something that he owed Mr. White. Furthermore, he could only do it in those 60 seconds, when Mr. White would have the opportunity to do whatever he deemed necessary.', u'When Mr. Pink is running from the cops, you can see a blue van with a window in the background, after Mr. Brown dies, Mr. White and Mr. Orange are walking away through an alley, the same blue van can be seen parked in the alley.', u'Supposedly Mr. Blonde and the character Vincent Vega from Pulp Fiction (1994) are brothers In a deleted scene of Pulp Fiction, Vincent Vega tells Mia Wallace that the singer, Suzanne Vega is his cousin and that makes Suzanne Vega Mr. Blondes cousin as well.', u'During the scene when Joe Cabot has given the men their false, colour-coded names, then Mr. Pink objects with, ""Oh why am I Mr. Pink?"" ""Because you\'re a faggot, alright?"" quips Tierney, causing Mr. Brown to laugh, watch Mr. Orange aka undercover cop Freddy Newendyke. In the ensuing argument between Cabot and Pink, Newendyke looks quite appprehensive, probably due to how angry Cabot gets with Pink. This foreshadows how angry Cabot gets with Newendyke at the end, when it\'s out in the open about him being the rat.', u'In a way Joe Cabot was speaking from experience when Mr. Pink said, ""Mr. Blue is dead?"" ""As dead as Dillinger"", Cabot replied. Lawrence Tierney played John Dillinger in Dillinger (1945). He also starred in a remake, Dillinger (1991).', u'Tim Roth gets gut shot and is cared for by Harvey Keitel. In Taxi Driver (1976), Sport, also played by Keitel, gets gut shot by Robert De Niro.', u'In the scene just before Joe Cabot gives the Reservoir Dogs their names, he says, ""All I want you guys to talk about if you have to, is what you\'re gonna do. That should do it"". While Joe is still speaking, the camera zooms in on Mr Orange, indicating in advance that he\'s the rat.', u""When Mr Orange has joined Nice Guy Eddie, Mr White and Mr Pink in the car, and Mr Orange, who in reality is an undercover cop called Freddy Newendyke and his fellow cops are following Eddie's car, there is an indication - no pun intended as cars are involved in this scene - that Mr Orange will rat on them, as in any instance where he isn't saying anything, he has a sly look on his face. It can only end badly for Mr Orange, as he soon gets in way over his head."", u'When a panicked Mr. Pink first arrives at the rendezvous point, he tells Mr. White that they were all set up and that there must be a rat within the group.
