However, of those who applied to be on the show there were not enough credible contestants who did not graduate from college. As a result, the teams were instead divided into males and females. The popularity of the show caused a very large number of people to apply to be contestants and the producers were then able to choose a full team with only those with high school educations that was more or less evenly matched with those who graduated from college.

There were discussions about moving the release into July or August 1993, especially when Universal deliberately chose to open Jurassic Park (1993) on June 11th, but it was decided that doing so would turn off potential moviegoers.

However, the f-word does actually appear in the movie, spoken by Lieutenant Dekker during one of his rapid-fire rants at Slater. Due to the nature of the scene it is hard to discern, but it is definitely there.', u'The film contains several intentional continuity errors.', u""John McTiernan said the film began as a wonderful Cinderella story, with a nine year old boy and a pretty good script. But the film didn't end as it began, referring to the film's troubled production and the fact that it opened in theaters a week after Jurassic Park (1993). After the film's failure, McTiernan retreated to his house in Wyoming, and took a break from his career."", u'The original screenplay was developed by Adam Leff and Zak Penn with Arnold Schwarzenegger in mind for the lead, and was titled ""Extremely Violent"". After Columbia purchased the script, the studio independently approached Arnold about the film. The star\'s decision came down to either the now-titled ""Last Action Hero"" or a Penny Marshall-directed Columbia comedy called ""Sweet Tooth"", with LAH winning out. The script was later re-written by Shane Black and David Arnott to rev up the action sequences, and William Goldman did a one million dollar polish when Arnold made it clear he would not begin filming until Goldman added depth for the film\'s characters.', u'Jack Slater, when trying to pose as Arnold Schwarzenegger in the real world, keeps getting the name wrong, and calling himself ""Arnold Braunschweiger."" The first part of Arnold\'s real name, ""Schwarz,"" means ""black"" in German, while the first part of his wrong name, ""Braun,"" means ""brown"" in German. Also, a ""Braunschweiger"" is a type of liverwurst made in Braunschweig (or Brunswick), Germany. In the German dub, he calls himself ""Arnold Beckenbauer"" (""Pool-Builder""), which creates additional comedy, since it is also the name of one of Germany\'s most famous soccer players.', u'During the shooting of the movie, Arnold Schwarzenegger gave an interview on the set to Dagmar Koller, a famous Austrian musical-star, for an Austrian television show. After the interview, Schwarzenegger invited her to appear in the movie. She can be seen in the police headquarters as Danny talks to her.', u'The police station is the lobby of an administration building on the Sony Pictures lot. It was also used as the lobby of the television station in The Running Man (1987), which also starred Arnold Schwarzenegger', u'Body Count: eighty-three.', u'After Benedict murders the car mechanic and wants to confess, someone in the background is carrying a pair of recently stolen shoes.', u'The film ran behind schedule, so much so that there was just one test screening that ran for two hours and twenty minutes with a lot of inaudible dialogue, boring the audience. The studio refused to delay the opening, so as not to send the message the film was in trouble, a decision Arnold Schwarzenegger agreed with.', u""Before the Hamlet sequence, wherein the Laurence Olivier version Hamlet (1948) is played on a projector, the teacher who introduces the film is Joan Plowright, Olivier's third wife and widow. Noting her students' apparent ignorance of Olivier's storied career, she tells them they may remember him as Zeus in Clash of the Titans (1981), one of Olivier's final roles."", u'Some trailers show a few deleted and alternate scenes, such as an extended Hamlet action scene where Arnold Schwarzenegger is in some water shooting at someone, Danny being blown away into the movie after dynamite pops out of screen, and an alternate take and angle for Slater\'s ""I hate when that happens"" line after he gets out of the tar pit. A couple other deleted scenes are from the original 140 minutes long rough cut include dialogue scene between Danny and Jack in which Danny says how his father died from cancer and a scene where a group of kids see Jack while he is walking across the street in the rain with Danny looking for Benedict and they think he is Schwarzenegger, so they ask him for his autograph which he signs.', u""In 1993, after attending the world premiere, Robin Quivers from the Howard Stern Show said it was the best movie she'd ever seen."", u""The filming involved a 3:00 pm to 3:00 am, 7-day, shutdown of six-block Times Square area in New York City for the production. Originally, a giant 75-foot balloon of Arnold Schwarzenegger held three few sticks of dynamite in the balloon's hand but, following the then-recent 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center, Richard Brick, Commissioner of the New York City Mayor's Office of Film, Theatre and Broadcasting and Gary Martin, President of Production at Columbia Pictures agreed to change the prop to a badge."", u'When Danny and Jack are looking in the video store for the action section to find a ""Schwarzenegger"" film. Danny is surprised and confused to see that Terminator 2 (1991)\'s poster features Sylvester Stallone and that apparently Schwarzenegger films do not exist. However, as Jack walks towards Danny to compliment Stallone\'s work, on the shelf alongside a number of other known Hollywood films of the time, a VHS tape of one of Arnold Schwarzenegger\'s earlier films Raw Deal (1986) is clearly visible, with Arnold featuring prominently on the cover.', u'Due to delays with the film Hook (1991), this was the first movie released in SDDS (Sony Dynamic Digital Sound). With five front channels and two rears, it was also the first film to include a 7.1 channel SDDS mix, rather than the more common 5.1 SDDS.', u""While Danny is in the movie, he says John Practice (F.

Later in the film, when Slater and Danny's mom are talking, the Overture to The Marriage of Figaro can be heard, composed by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart."", u""Benedict's pistol is a Dan Wesson .357 revolver. Most noted for its interchangeable barrels on the same frame, from two inches to ten inches. Slater carries a Desert Eagle .50 caliber Action Express."", u'The fact that Jack Slater was out to avenge the death of his second cousin Frank in ""Jack Slater IV"" was an intentionally ridiculous element. The idea was that having gone through so many epic, personal conflicts with super-villains during the first three films, Jack Slater was left to battle the mob due to the death of a very minor character. This would also allow the Danny Madigan character to start listing the flaws of the Jack Slater films, as well as how they were running out of good ideas.', u'The first time Arnold Schwarzenegger took a producing credit on a film.', u'In the film, the characters are able to enter and leave the movie world via a magic ticket which is credited to famous stage illusionist and escapologist Harry Houdini. However, in real-life, Houdini was firmly opposed to the idea of supernatural powers, and spent his time debunking fake spiritualists and phony mediums.', u'The name of the boss gangster, Tony Vivaldi, is a spoof of the famous classical composer Antonio Vivaldi. Jokes about classical music are a recurring theme in this movie.', u'In one scene, Jack says to Danny, regarding his ex-wife, ""Do you think I would marry someone so stupid that doesn\'t know the real voice from a taped one?"" In Arnold Schwarzenegger\'s next film, True Lies (1994), he uses a taped voice to fool his wife.', u""Sir Ian McKellen plays Death, a character out of Ingmar Bergman's film The Seventh Seal (1957). In that film, Death was played by Swedish actor Bengt Ekerot."", u'Tori Spelling had a cameo as herself but it was eventually left on the cutting room floor.', u'The film makes several oblique references to the Governor of Los Angeles. These are eerily prescient statements to make with Arnold Schwarzenegger later becoming the Governor of California.', u'Charles Dance replaced Timothy Dalton as Benedict. Had this not happened, this would have been the second of two movies with Dalton and Frank McRae, even though they would not have had any screentime together. The first was Licence to Kill (1989).', u'Tony Curtis was cast in a major cameo but was replaced.', u'Jean-Claude Van Damme features in the premiere scene.

Robert Prosky was also in that film, plus Cinematographer Donald McAlpine had filmed Predator (1987), also directed by John McTiernan, and which also starred Schwarzenegger. They reunited with this film.', u'There are similarities to Die Hard (1988), like Jack Slater falling from the building and elevator, like Hans Gruber in Die Hard (1988), which was also directed by John McTiernan.

The guy\'s hanging there by his neck and at the end of the movie he comes back"", after the car crash scene in New York involving Benedict and the Tough Asian Man, Danny referenced Die Hard (1988) previously directed by John McTiernan. In addition, Professor Toru Tanaka\'s bad guy in this film was killed by Arnold Schwarzenegger\'s good guy, just like in The Running Man (1987). Tanaka yet again came to a sticky end with Schwarzenegger.', u'When Jack kills The Ripper, The Ripper says, ""I\'ll be back!"", to which Jack replies, ""the hell you will!""

muscle measurements as he had 12 years previously while shooting Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003).', u'J.K. Simmons was stated to have improvised many of his lines. His description of a rocket to the T-800 (""Blows a door clean off. You know, for people who can\'t do that themselves."") even earns a stare of surprise from Arnold Schwarzenegger.', u'The body of young Arnold Schwarzenegger in the movie (also seen in the film\'s first trailer) is provided by actor and bodybuilder Brett Azar. Azar won the role following an open casting call looking for a person who can match the closest to Schwarzenegger\'s physique in the first film. Azar never thought of the idea of being in this film until he was persuaded by his manager Mike Lyons to audition. According to Azar, aside from being judged having the closest physique (the first round of auditions involves body and muscle measurement), it was his audition video of him reenacting the Terminator\'s arrival at the Griffith Observatory and his perfect lip-syncing of Schwarzenegger\'s line, ""Your clothes, give them to me. Now."" at the three punks resulted in him winning the role. His face was replaced with Schwarzenegger in post-production. Schwarzenegger was Azar\'s bodybuilding idol and Arnold gifted him cigars and several bodybuilding magazines after the first day of shooting.', u'This is the first film that Arnold Schwarzenegger is not credited as ""Terminator"" in the ending credits. Rather, he is named ""Guardian"".', u'Tom Hardy was the first choice for John Connor.', u'The original director of The Terminator (1984) James Cameron asked and got to officially endorse this film.

This shows his natural gray hair.', u""Costume designer Susan Matheson encountered trouble looking for brand new Nike Vandal shoes that Kyle Reese wears in the 1984 sequence. Her search online and other various avenues mostly had second-hand and worn Vandals for sale. For months, she approached Nike with the request of manufacturing that specific model of shoes but Nike wanted her to design an ID with an Air-Force base. Matheson refused because being a person with knowledge of sneakers, she did not want to feel guilty of cheating the audience, especially eagle-eye fans of the first film who can spot the difference between those two bases. It was only after intervention by Paramount that Nike agreed to shutdown production and manufactured 25 pairs of Vandals solely for this film, in what is called as Matheson's greatest personal moment in this film."", u""This is Paramount studio's first film in The Terminator series. James Cameron had first approached them to do The Terminator (1984) and they were very interested. However, the only stipulation was that Cameron did not direct the film, as they felt he would be over-ambitious with the budgets they could provide. Since this was Cameron's pet project at the time and he wanted to direct the film, he respectfully turned down their offer."", u""This is the first film in the series to not feature animatronic Terminators created by special effects artist (and dear friend of Arnold Schwarzenegger) Stan Winston, due to his death in 2008.

This has lead to people referring to him as the ""Rusty Griswold"" of the Terminator series as five different actors have portrayed that role in the many films.', u""During the 1984 period of the film, the Guardian (Arnold Schwarzenegger) loses the skin on his right arm. When Sarah later asks him why he can't travel with them to 2017, he states he needs time for his skin to regrow. Although Terminator 2 (1991) already established that the human tissue on a Terminator can actually heal, this is the first movie to confirm that the skin can actually regenerate completely."", u'In the second trailer, where the Terminator meets Kyle Reese and says ""Nice to meet you!"" as he makes a big funny smile, Sarah states that she had been teaching the Terminator to blend in. The scene was written as a nod to a scene that was cut from Terminator 2 (1991), where John teaches The Terminator to smile so that he can be more human and blend in; the Terminator imitates a man talking on a phone, but the smile is imperfect and crooked and John insists that The Terminator should try practicing in a mirror. This scene can be found when watching the Blu-Ray Skynet Edition of Terminator 2: Judgment Day.', u'This is the first film in the series to actually show characters being sent back in time, and the machine that does it.', u'James Cameron said this film was the natural follow up to Terminator 2 (1991).

However, they are not related to Harlan Ellison whose name is credited in The Terminator (1984)."", u""In The Terminator (1984), it was established that Terminators do not just wear living human tissue to blend in. They wear the living human tissue, so they can go through the Time Displacement Field. Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) surmised that living tissue generates a field necessary for time traveling, as 'nothing dead will go'. In this film, it is added that if a Terminator would go through without living human tissue, or if the metal underneath is exposed, it would quickly heat up the metal akin to a microwave, and blow up along with the Time Displacement Field. With the living human tissue, The Time Displacement Field cannot penetrate the Terminator's endoskeleton."", u""Screenwriter Laeta Kalogridis said that the main inspiration of the film was the second-half of Back to the Future Part II (1989) where Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) ended up visiting an alternate 1985 after the older Biff Tannen's (Thomas F. Wilson) visit to 1955. They also used the best moments from the first two films as a base for their story. Kalogridis and Patrick Lussier originally turned down the offer to write this film three times because they did not like the storyline for the third and fourth installments without affecting the first two films."", u'In one scene, Kyle Reese calls the T-800 (Arnold Schwarzenegger) a ""skin job"". This is a nod to Blade Runner (1982), where Rick Deckard\'s (Harrison Ford\'s) boss, Bryant (M. Emmet Walsh), refers to the Nexus 6 cyborgs as skin jobs.

Come on!"" in the third, and Kyle Reese says it again in the fourth installment.', u""Arnold Schwarzenegger's first movie for Paramount Pictures."", u""Emilia Clarke took special weapons training to play Sarah Connor.

However, this could also refer to one of the versions of Microsoft Windows operating system.', u'Arnold Schwarzenegger signed up after reading the script and thought the script was well-written.', u'The first film in the series to be shot digitally, as well as the first to be shot with anamorphic lenses.', u'It was thought Robert Patrick who played the T-1000 in Terminator 2 (1991) makes a cameo as a man at the hospital reception area in the hospital fight between Terminator Pops and John Connor and is seen talking on a mobile phone. However, Patrick confirmed that ""I am not in the new movie"".', u'Bringing back Arnold Schwarzenegger as the Terminator for the reboot and for the current timeline was heavily influenced by Star Trek (2009): Spock Prime (Leonard Nimoy) enters an alternate timeline and meets his younger self (Zachary Quinto) and a younger Captain James T.

Boen played Dr. Peter Silberman in The Terminator (1984), Terminator 2 (1991) and Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003). It can, however, be argued that Schwarzenegger himself did not physically appear in Terminator Salvation, as his presence there was created through digital special effects. In that case, Terminator Genisys is the first.', u""This is the third film in which Arnold Schwarzenegger's character comes face to face with a duplicate of himself.

In order to concentrate on producing art-house based films on her Annapurna label, the rights were then transferred in early 2014 to her brother David. Previous rights holders Victor Kubicek and Derek Anderson were forced to relinquish the rights due to Halycon's debt issues, which was a result of an investigation by the FBI of their company over an alleged hedge fund fraud discovered during financing of Terminator Salvation (2009).

However, due to the limitations in special effects, the idea for the shape-shifter was not used until Terminator 2 (1991). For T2, Cameron briefly considered the idea of two T-800s in Arnold Schwarzenegger's likeness battling each other, one being the 'good' Terminator, the other one evil; this was eventually changed to one T-800 and a T-1000. In Terminator Genisys, both a cyborg (the T-800) and a liquid android (T-1000) are sent back to the altered timeline of 1984, and there are two T-800s in Arnold's likeness battling each other (even though the evil one is technically not played by Arnold but a body double)."", u'The scene where Sarah and Kyle arrive in 2017 barenaked in the middle of a freeway was a nod to Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles (2008) Pilot (#1.1), where Sarah, John, and Cameron arrive in 2007 in the middle of a freeway barenaked.', u'Throughout the film, John Connor bears scars on the left side of his face.

He didn't know which one, so he took them all out. He shoots Caroline when she tries to apprehend him, and then leaves with the money.

Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger had been discussed between the two men for many years, as far back as the mid-1980s. Different scripts had been pitched or written, but Schwarzenegger said his and Stallone's schedules were not able to match up. Schwarzenegger's exit as governor and his cameo appearance in Stallone's The Expendables (2010) prompted the two of them to revisit the idea of working together in both this movie and The Expendables 2 (2012)."", u'During filming on Bourbon Street in New Orleans, a military convention caused streams of uniformed soldiers and Marines to accidentally stumble onto the set. When the crew began to clear the set for the shoot, Sylvester Stallone made a point to stop and pose for pictures with multiple men and women in uniform.', u'The passage that Rottmayer quotes in German is the Parable of the Madman from ""The Gay Science"" by Friedrich Nietzsche, making this film one of less than a handful of films in which Arnold Schwarzenegger is heard speaking in his native language.', u'(At around 63 mins) Abigail is seen at Breslin\'s desk. On this desk are a few puzzle-like models, one of which appears to depict the structure of the infamous ""super-chip"" from Cyberdyne Systems as shown in the Terminator movies, which Arnold Schwarzenegger was in.', u'The German dubbing studio decided to recast the voice of Arnold Schwarzenegger with Ralph Schicha (who used a slight Austrian accent which adds a little extra fun for German audiences (since Danneberg normally dubs Schwarzenegger in Standard German)). The reason for this was that Thomas Danneberg, who normally dubs Schwarzenegger, is also the German dubbing voice of Sylvester Stallone. It was feared that the same voice for two actors might confuse audiences. However, some fans did not like the decision and pleaded for a new dubbing which was ultimately denied by the German licensee Concorde.', u""Miles Chapman's original script had called for the electronic keypad to be on the inside of the solitary cell at the Bendwater prison in Colorado. While storyboarding the film's opening sequence, the filmmakers realized that this was a mistake and the keypad was relocated to the outside of the cell."", u""Hobbes working on butterflies is a reference to the film Papillon (1973) in which a convict repeatedly tries to escape Devil's Island.

This is Jeremiah 15:6 of the King James Bible.', u'This was the third prison-themed movie for Sylvester Stallone. The previous two were Victory (1981) and Lock Up (1989).', u'When Faran Tahir\'s character (Javed) says ""God is Great"" Jim Caviezel character (Hobbes) replies with ""Eh, Whatever"".

Fortress (1992) was considered to be a futuristic remake of the prison flick Lock Up (1989) starring Sylvester Stallone.', u""In Stallone's previous film, Bullet To The Head, his partner comments that there was not enough evidence to court Marshall him for selling C4 on the black market, as is on Stallone's police file. In Escape Plan, his characters' alias in the prison is there for manufacturing bombs used in acts of terrorism."", u'While filming Arnold Schwarzenegger\'s scenes in the helicopter, director Mikael H\xe5fstr\xf6m asked writer Miles Chapman to add a line for Rottmayer after the explosion on the ship. Chapman realized that earlier in the film Warden Hobbes had said ""Have a lovely day, Mr. Rottmayer."" Chapman then added the line ""Have a lovely day, asshole"" for Rottmayer. Chapman said he has received requests from fans to come up with a t-shirt with the line ""Have a lovely day, asshole"" on it.', u""Sylvester Stallone's last day on set was spent filming the scene in which his character Ray Breslin surfaces in the ocean and signals to the helicopter. Stallone had pulled his right bicep muscle the previous day and was unable to use his right arm. This is why he waves to the helicopter and starts to climb the rope ladder with his left arm."", u'The cargo ship converted to a prison in this movie is Rican, IMO number 7621932.

De Souza stated the Commando 2 script for Arnold Schwarzenegger was a lot like this film, (and not Die Hard (1988)) even though it was set in a building with security and bad guys, etc. Coincidentally, Arnold and Sly were considered to play John McClane in Die Hard (1988), but they turned it down and it went to their pal, Planet Hollywood co-founder and Expendables (2010) co-star Bruce Willis, who was considered for Stallone's role in this film."", u'Just like in First Blood (1982), there is a scene where Stallone and his guard are going to the cell. In First Blood (1982), they first have to take stairs to reach it. But in both movies the door is at their left side, and the keypad is also at the left, but in First Blood (1982), it is mounted much higher.

(a popular internet meme) in the screenplay. Norris\'s wife Gena O\'Kelly suggested him the one with the cobra. (""Chuck Norris was bitten by a cobra, and after five days of excruciating pain... the cobra died."")', u'Sylvester Stallone explained that his casting was looking particularly for actors who had not experienced recent hits: ""I like using people that had a moment and then maybe have fallen on some hard times and give them another shot. I like those kinds of guys. Someone did it for me and I like to see if I can do it for them.""', u'Chuck Norris agreed to come out of retirement from acting at the age of 71 in order to appear in this film.', u'The film reveals that Gunnar Jensen (Dolph Lundgren) has an advance degree of chemical engineering. This is a reference to Lundgren himself, who earned a degree in chemistry from Washington State University in 1976, a degree in chemical engineering from the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm in the early 1980s, then a Master\'s Degree in Chemical Engineering from the University of Sydney in Sydney in 1982. The character abandoned his career a scientist to work as bouncer in order to impress a girl. In real life, Lundgren turned it down to work as bodyguard for his then girlfriend Grace Jones. Further, while stuck in the mine Gunnar refers to himself as a ""Fulbright Scholar"" which Lundgren also achieved in real life.', u'Gunner Jensen refers to Chuck Norris\' character Booker as the ""Lone Wolf"". This is a reference to the Chuck Norris movie Lone Wolf McQuade (1983).', u'John Travolta and Nicolas Cage were considered to work with Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone in this film. Ironically 15 years previously, Travolta and Cage took the roles of Sean Archer and Castor Troy in Face/Off (1997) which was made and written for Stallone and Schwarzenegger.', u'A stuntman died and another was left in a critical condition while filming an action scene for the movie in Bulgaria, that included an explosion on a rubber boat.', u'Tennis player Novak Djokovic filmed a cameo for the airport shootout for free. However his scene, which involved him beating down terrorists with his racket, was cut.', u'Liam Hemsworth was originally cast in The Expendables (2010) but when the script was re-written, his role was cut out.

The name of Chuck Norris was most often associated with this story, that he was having problems with the extreme violence and basically refusing to take part in the movie unless it would be toned down.', u""In an interview with BBC Radio, Sylvester Stallone confirmed that he named Jean-Claude Van Damme's character 'Vilain' to make it similar to the name of 19th Century French poet Paul Verlaine. This was to set up an extremely obscure in-joke where the final showdown between Van Damme and Stallone, could be seen as a fight between Vilain/Verlaine and Rambo/Rimbaud.

Also the fourth movie starring Van Damme and Lundgren after Universal Soldier (1992), Universal Soldier: Regeneration (2009) and Universal Soldier: Day of Reckoning (2012). And the only collaboration with the two action stars that is not a Universal Soldier film.', u'At the start of the film, Sylvester Stallone drives a 4x4 with a heavy metal plow on the rear. When he spins the vehicle and drives with the plow facing front, his 4x4 bears more than a passing resemblance to a vehicle from Judge Dredd, another Sylvester Stallone film.', u'Just like the movie Rambo, which also stars sly Stallone - there is an Australian sniper with the Barret 50 cal. Sniper rifle.', u""The song Expendables sing in the closing scene is composed of several unrelated verses from the 1912 poem 'Congo' by Vachel Lindsay."", u""Scott Adkins, who played Jean-Claude Van Damme's right hand man, played the main character in the movie Hard Target 2 (2016). It is the direct-to-video sequel of the film Hard Target (1993) where Van-Damme played the main character."", u'Near the end of the movie, Barney Ross says ""That thing belongs in a museum."" This was a famous line from Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989). Coincidentially, Harrison Ford, who played Indiana Jones, appeared as CIA Agent Drummer in Expendables 3 (2014), after Bruce Willis refused to return as Mr. Church. Harrison Ford, like Arnold and Sly, was offered to play John McClane in Die Hard but turned it down and the role then went to Bruce Willis.', u""The working storyline had Mickey Rourke from The Expendables (2010) returning as Tool and being killed off as the motivation for the team's subsequent actions. This was changed to Liam Hemsworth's character when Rourke abruptly left the production to pursue another project."", u'In the final scene, Arnold Schwarzenegger is wearing a vintage Hawaiian style Planet Hollywood Jam shirt under his jacket.

His ""perk package"" included a lump sum of $1.5 million for private jets, a fully equipped gym trailer, three-bedroom deluxe suites on location, round-the-clock limousines, and personal bodyguards. He also insisted on, and got, 20% of the gross receipts made by the venture from every market in the world-including movie theaters, videos, DVDs, television licensing, in-flight entertainment, game licensing, and so forth-once the movie had reached its cash break-even point. Such ""contingent compensation"" is not unusual in movie contracts, but, in most cases, Hollywood accounting famously uses smoke and mirrors to make sure to define ""break-even"" in such a way that a movie never reaches it.

John and Kate had attended the same school, and the day before John encountered the T-1000 and the T-800 at the Galleria, when John and Kate made out in Mike Kripke's basement, John may have told Kate that he was going to the Galleria the next day."", u""It took six months for the VFX pioneers to develop the method to simulate the sequence in which T-X's liquid exterior is magnetized to the point of peeling off, revealing her alloy endoskeleton.

A short section of it was built in reality, for the scenes where John, Kate and the T-X are running alongside it. For separate shots, the set dressers would slightly re-arrange it, so it would not look completely obvious that they were running past the same section over and over (as production designer Jeff Mann put it, to avoid the 'Flintstone effect'). According to director Jonathan Mostow on the commentary track, as much of the footage was used as possible, just cutting away before the point where the actors literally ran off the set."", u'In each Terminator film the villainous character\'s death is greeted with the word ""Terminated"" in some way: - In The Terminator (1984) Sarah Connor says ""You\'re terminated fucker"" as she crushes the Terminator in the hydraulic press - In Terminator 2 (1991) John Connor asks ""Is it dead?"" (of the melted T1000) to which the Terminator replies ""Terminated"" - In Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003) the Terminator says ""You are Terminated!"" as it destroys the TX.', u""When the Terminator is pounding on the Jeep, while fighting the T-X's corruption in his system, the Jeep was specially rigged to straighten itself out again afterward until the scene was filmed.

Shortly after, a soundtrack excerpt from the Die Hard theme plays in the background.', u'The words ""A Franco Columbu film"" appear on the screen at the beginning of Jack Slater IV. Columbu is a bodybuilder friend of star Arnold Schwarzenegger\'s, who has appeared in the following films with him: Pumping Iron (1977), Conan the Barbarian (1982), The Terminator (1984), The Running Man (1987), and Beretta\'s Island (1993).', u'Art Carney\'s (Jack Slater\'s second-favorite cousin Frank) final film appearance. Frank\'s last words were ""I\'m outta here"". Prophetically, those were in fact the last words he spoke on-screen.', u""The explosion of Jack Slater's ex-wife's house was used from The Last Boy Scout (1991), also written by Shane Black."", u'At one point, Danny produces a piece of paper with a word (presumably the f-word or some variation) written on it and asks Slater to say it; Slater refuses, and Danny cites this as yet more evidence that they are in a film, as the f-word was not allowed in PG-13 films at the time the movie was made. However, the f-word does actually appear in the movie, spoken by Lieutenant Dekker during one of his rapid-fire rants at Slater. Due to the nature of the scene it is hard to discern, but it is definitely there.', u'The film contains several intentional continuity errors.', u""John McTiernan said the film began as a wonderful Cinderella story, with a nine year old boy and a pretty good script. But the film didn't end as it began, referring to the film's troubled production and the fact that it opened in theaters a week after Jurassic Park (1993). After the film's failure, McTiernan retreated to his house in Wyoming, and took a break from his career."", u'The original screenplay was developed by Adam Leff and Zak Penn with Arnold Schwarzenegger in mind for the lead, and was titled ""Extremely Violent"". After Columbia purchased the script, the studio independently approached Arnold about the film. The star\'s decision came down to either the now-titled ""Last Action Hero"" or a Penny Marshall-directed Columbia comedy called ""Sweet Tooth"", with LAH winning out. The script was later re-written by Shane Black and David Arnott to rev up the action sequences, and William Goldman did a one million dollar polish when Arnold made it clear he would not begin filming until Goldman added depth for the film\'s characters.', u'Jack Slater, when trying to pose as Arnold Schwarzenegger in the real world, keeps getting the name wrong, and calling himself ""Arnold Braunschweiger."" The first part of Arnold\'s real name, ""Schwarz,"" means ""black"" in German, while the first part of his wrong name, ""Braun,"" means ""brown"" in German. Also, a ""Braunschweiger"" is a type of liverwurst made in Braunschweig (or Brunswick), Germany. In the German dub, he calls himself ""Arnold Beckenbauer"" (""Pool-Builder""), which creates additional comedy, since it is also the name of one of Germany\'s most famous soccer players.', u'During the shooting of the movie, Arnold Schwarzenegger gave an interview on the set to Dagmar Koller, a famous Austrian musical-star, for an Austrian television show. After the interview, Schwarzenegger invited her to appear in the movie. She can be seen in the police headquarters as Danny talks to her.', u'The police station is the lobby of an administration building on the Sony Pictures lot. It was also used as the lobby of the television station in The Running Man (1987), which also starred Arnold Schwarzenegger', u'Body Count: eighty-three.', u'After Benedict murders the car mechanic and wants to confess, someone in the background is carrying a pair of recently stolen shoes.', u'The film ran behind schedule, so much so that there was just one test screening that ran for two hours and twenty minutes with a lot of inaudible dialogue, boring the audience. The studio refused to delay the opening, so as not to send the message the film was in trouble, a decision Arnold Schwarzenegger agreed with.', u""Before the Hamlet sequence, wherein the Laurence Olivier version Hamlet (1948) is played on a projector, the teacher who introduces the film is Joan Plowright, Olivier's third wife and widow. Noting her students' apparent ignorance of Olivier's storied career, she tells them they may remember him as Zeus in Clash of the Titans (1981), one of Olivier's final roles."", u'Some trailers show a few deleted and alternate scenes, such as an extended Hamlet action scene where Arnold Schwarzenegger is in some water shooting at someone, Danny being blown away into the movie after dynamite pops out of screen, and an alternate take and angle for Slater\'s ""I hate when that happens"" line after he gets out of the tar pit. A couple other deleted scenes are from the original 140 minutes long rough cut include dialogue scene between Danny and Jack in which Danny says how his father died from cancer and a scene where a group of kids see Jack while he is walking across the street in the rain with Danny looking for Benedict and they think he is Schwarzenegger, so they ask him for his autograph which he signs.', u""In 1993, after attending the world premiere, Robin Quivers from the Howard Stern Show said it was the best movie she'd ever seen."", u""The filming involved a 3:00 pm to 3:00 am, 7-day, shutdown of six-block Times Square area in New York City for the production. Originally, a giant 75-foot balloon of Arnold Schwarzenegger held three few sticks of dynamite in the balloon's hand but, following the then-recent 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center, Richard Brick, Commissioner of the New York City Mayor's Office of Film, Theatre and Broadcasting and Gary Martin, President of Production at Columbia Pictures agreed to change the prop to a badge."", u'When Danny and Jack are looking in the video store for the action section to find a ""Schwarzenegger"" film. Danny is surprised and confused to see that Terminator 2 (1991)\'s poster features Sylvester Stallone and that apparently Schwarzenegger films do not exist. However, as Jack walks towards Danny to compliment Stallone\'s work, on the shelf alongside a number of other known Hollywood films of the time, a VHS tape of one of Arnold Schwarzenegger\'s earlier films Raw Deal (1986) is clearly visible, with Arnold featuring prominently on the cover.', u'Due to delays with the film Hook (1991), this was the first movie released in SDDS (Sony Dynamic Digital Sound). With five front channels and two rears, it was also the first film to include a 7.1 channel SDDS mix, rather than the more common 5.1 SDDS.', u""While Danny is in the movie, he says John Practice (F. Murray Abraham) killed Mozart, a reference to the movie Amadeus (1984), where Abraham played Antonio Salieri. Later in the film, when Slater and Danny's mom are talking, the Overture to The Marriage of Figaro can be heard, composed by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart."", u""Benedict's pistol is a Dan Wesson .357 revolver. Most noted for its interchangeable barrels on the same frame, from two inches to ten inches. Slater carries a Desert Eagle .50 caliber Action Express."", u'The fact that Jack Slater was out to avenge the death of his second cousin Frank in ""Jack Slater IV"" was an intentionally ridiculous element. The idea was that having gone through so many epic, personal conflicts with super-villains during the first three films, Jack Slater was left to battle the mob due to the death of a very minor character. This would also allow the Danny Madigan character to start listing the flaws of the Jack Slater films, as well as how they were running out of good ideas.', u'The first time Arnold Schwarzenegger took a producing credit on a film.', u'In the film, the characters are able to enter and leave the movie world via a magic ticket which is credited to famous stage illusionist and escapologist Harry Houdini. However, in real-life, Houdini was firmly opposed to the idea of supernatural powers, and spent his time debunking fake spiritualists and phony mediums.', u'The name of the boss gangster, Tony Vivaldi, is a spoof of the famous classical composer Antonio Vivaldi. Jokes about classical music are a recurring theme in this movie.', u'In one scene, Jack says to Danny, regarding his ex-wife, ""Do you think I would marry someone so stupid that doesn\'t know the real voice from a taped one?"" In Arnold Schwarzenegger\'s next film, True Lies (1994), he uses a taped voice to fool his wife.', u""Sir Ian McKellen plays Death, a character out of Ingmar Bergman's film The Seventh Seal (1957). In that film, Death was played by Swedish actor Bengt Ekerot."", u'Tori Spelling had a cameo as herself but it was eventually left on the cutting room floor.', u'The film makes several oblique references to the Governor of Los Angeles. These are eerily prescient statements to make with Arnold Schwarzenegger later becoming the Governor of California.', u'Charles Dance replaced Timothy Dalton as Benedict. Had this not happened, this would have been the second of two movies with Dalton and Frank McRae, even though they would not have had any screentime together. The first was Licence to Kill (1989).', u'Tony Curtis was cast in a major cameo but was replaced.', u'Jean-Claude Van Damme features in the premiere scene. He would later star opposite Arnold Schwarzenegger in The Expendables 2 (2012).', u""Danny's New York City apartment is unit number 3D, an indication that he lives in the real world, as opposed to the 2-D world of Jack's movies."", u'Final on-screen appearance of Professor Toru Tanaka.', u'In Blockbuster, there is a cardboard cutout for Terminator 2 (1991). The actor shown instead of Arnold Schwarzenegger is Sylvester Stallone.', u'Little Richard has a cameo as himself in this film. In Predator (1987), another John McTiernan movie starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, his ""Long Tall Sally"" was featured prominently, both on the radio and sung by one of the characters.', u'The scenes that are playing on the television in Blockbuster, are from the movie Thunderheart (1992).', u'This movie features two actors who played the character of Antonio Salieri: F.

When Jack Slater pulls into the parking lot at Police Headquarters (actually a Sony Pictures office building), the Los Angeles Coat of Arms out front, has the American eagle (with a federal shield with four stars in the Chief in escutcheon) instead of the Mexican eagle in the third quarter, and a black rhinoceros (instead of the red Bear) in the California state flag in the second quarter.', u'When Jack Slater punches the Lieutenant Governor and says: ""When the Governor gets here, call me."" Arnold Schwarzenegger went on to be the Governor of California.', u""(At around thirty-nine minutes) In the video store, Jack Slater's hand is resting almost right next to a DVD case for The Road Warrior (1981), which was the inspiration for The Terminator (1984), with Arnold Schwarzenegger in the title role. This is also during the conversation with Danny Madigan about how it was supposed to be Arnold in Terminator 2 (1991), but instead had Sylvester Stallone."", u'John McTiernan and Composer Michael Kamen also collaborated on Die Hard (1988) and Die Hard with a Vengeance (1995).', u'The Region 2 PAL United Kingdom DVD includes German, Italian, French, and Spanish audio tracks as well as the original English.

These films were Revenge (1990) and China Moon (1994) respectively.', u'Arnold Schwarzenegger\'s name is mentioned in the song ""Jump Around"" by House of Pain in Mrs. Doubtfire (1993). Robert Prosky was also in that film, plus Cinematographer Donald McAlpine had filmed Predator (1987), also directed by John McTiernan, and which also starred Schwarzenegger. They reunited with this film.', u'There are similarities to Die Hard (1988), like Jack Slater falling from the building and elevator, like Hans Gruber in Die Hard (1988), which was also directed by John McTiernan. Arnold Schwarzenegger was considered for the part of John McClane, before Bruce Willis got the part. Arnold and Bruce later worked on The Expendables (2010) and The Expendables 2 (2012).', u'When Danny Madigan says to Jack Slater, ""They always look dead. Like in Die Hard. The guy\'s hanging there by his neck and at the end of the movie he comes back"", after the car crash scene in New York involving Benedict and the Tough Asian Man, Danny referenced Die Hard (1988) previously directed by John McTiernan. In addition, Professor Toru Tanaka\'s bad guy in this film was killed by Arnold Schwarzenegger\'s good guy, just like in The Running Man (1987). Tanaka yet again came to a sticky end with Schwarzenegger.', u'When Jack kills The Ripper, The Ripper says, ""I\'ll be back!"", to which Jack replies, ""the hell you will!""

He is clearly much younger in the desert, for instance, than in other scenes. His voice began to break, and had to be pitched to one level in post-production.', u'Until The Bourne Ultimatum (2007), this was the only sequel to win an Academy Award when the previous installment(s) received no nomination.', u'A female passer-by actually wandered onto the biker bar set thinking it was real, despite walking past all the location trucks, cameras and lights. Seeing Arnold Schwarzenegger standing in the bar dressed only in boxer shorts, she wondered aloud what was going on, only for Schwarzenegger to reply that it was male stripper night. Whether coincidence or not, in Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003), the Terminator (played again by Schwarzenegger) actually steps into bar during a male stripper night.', u""For the Los Angeles River sequence, Arnold Schwarzenegger was in pain because, since he couldn't wear a glove while cocking the gun, his fingers would get stuck in the mechanism. He tore the skin from his fingers and hand many times before he mastered it; and he achieved this while trying to act and control a Harley at the same time as James Cameron told him where to look. He couldn't dart his eyes either because it would have ruined the shot. Shooting the gates also took weeks of practice because he had to also act cool while doing it."", u'In the audio commentary, James Cameron says that not only was the biker bar scene filmed across the street from where LAPD officers beat up Rodney King, but that they were filming the night of the beating.', u'Special Effects guru Stan Winston and his crew studied hours of nuclear test footage, in order to make Sarah Connor\'s ""nuclear nightmare"" scene look as realistic as possible. A miniature Los Angeles was made to simulate the scene. Some of the materials used in the miniature that mimicked all the destroyed masonry were Matzos crackers and Shredded Wheat. After each take, it would take on average two days to set the model up to shoot again. In late 1991, members of several U.S. federal nuclear testing labs unofficially declared it ""the most accurate depiction of a nuclear blast ever created for a fictional motion picture"". The special effects team members have also stated that no other scene that they ever worked on has elicited such strong emotions in viewers.', u'Robert Patrick trained in a rigorous running regime in order to be able to appear to run at high speeds without showing fatigue on film.', u'According to James Cameron, Linda Hamilton suffered permanent hearing loss in one ear during the elevator shootout because she had not replaced her ear plugs after removing them between takes.', u'Linda Hamilton learned to pick locks for the scene in the mental hospital where she does precisely that with a paperclip.', u'Linda Hamilton\'s twin sister, Leslie Hamilton Gearren was used as a double in scenes involving two ""Sarah Connors"" (for example, when the T-1000 was imitating her), and in a scene not in the theatrical release (but on the DVD) as a mirror image of Linda.', u'The Terminators seen at the beginning of the movie were fully workable animatronic models.', u'Given Arnold Schwarzenegger\'s fifteen million dollar salary, and his total of seven hundred words of dialogue, he was paid 21,429 dollars per word. ""Hasta la vista, baby"" cost 85,716 dollars.', u'This is the only Terminator film to win or be nominated for an Oscar. It won four, and was nominated for two others.', u'Carolco studio executives were nervous and concerned when the original budget of 75 million dollars ballooned up to 88 million dollars, with more to come. In order to keep the budget manageable, they proposed to eliminate a few scenes, particularly the opening biker bar scene where the Terminator was introduced.

According to the Arnold Schwarzenegger book \'The Life and Times\', Cameron contacted Schwarzenegger, who was to go visit his friend Bruce Willis for Christmas, to come back for shooting that crucial scene.

However, he knew that half of the film's rights were owned by Hemdale (producer of The Terminator (1984)) - ultimately went bankrupt - and the lack of funding prevented him from working. While working on Total recall - unohda tai kuole (1990), with Mario Kassar and Andrew G.

Cameron wanted to end the film with the alternate Coda Ending (the older Sarah in future) as a bookend, but Kassar wanted to end the film in an another way (as a measure for possible sequels).

She refuses, so they smack her in the gut with their batons and force the pills down her throat, then kick her while she\'s on the floor doubled over in pain.Another hospital scene was cut that took place after John Connor robs the ATM and heads for the mall. Sarah Connor was to have a dream where Reese appears and warns her that THEIR son is in danger. She has to save him, etc. They kiss and hug, but Reese disappears and walks out. Sarah chases him outside, to find herself in the same spot as the nuclear nightmare scene later in the movie. She sees the large white flash, and then she wakes up. This is the only scene that Michael Biehn was in, and appeared in some promotional trailers. Cameron cut the scene because he thought that audiences who had not seen the first movie would be confused by the appearance of Kyle.A scene showing the T-1000 at the scene of the crashed truck in the canal, where he steals a police car.After the T-1000 kills John\'s foster parents, he ventures outside and kills the dog to check it\'s nametag, which is stamped with the name ""Max"". The T-1000 does this because the Terminator hung up as soon as the T-1000 confirms the wrong name by calling the dog ""Wolfie"" and now knows John will not trust his \'parents\' and so gives up waiting for John to return home.After killing the dog, the T-1000 goes to John\'s room to try to find any clues as to where John might be. He stalks around the room waving his arms and ""feeling"" things on the shelves, on the walls, etc. He eventually stops in front of a poster, realizes there is something behind it, rips it down and finds a box of mementos (pictures, and the like). This must be where the T-1000 figures out about Sarah\'s current whereabouts, and the desert compound that Sarah, John, and the Terminator head to after the hospital. Director James Cameron decided to cut it because the T-1000\'s sampling abilities were already sufficiently conveyed in earlier scenes, so this scene became redundant (and because it made the T-1000 look too much like it had x-ray vision). This scene was NOT included in the SE.At the abandoned gas station, a scene involved Sarah and John talking with the Terminator about learning. He tells them that his CPU was switched to read-only before being sent out. Skynet doesn\'t want them to learn too much while on their own. John asks if it can be reset. You then see the Terminator\'s face in a ""mirror"" talking Sarah through the procedure. A puppet was used for the foreground Sarah to work on and Linda Hamilton\'s twin sister Leslie Hamilton Gearren was in the mirror mimicking Linda\'s hand movements. After the CPU is removed, the Terminator shuts-down and Sarah places it on a table. She picks up a hammer and tries to smash it to render him inoperative. John stops her and says they need him. He starts to show authority for the first time and asks her how he is supposed to be a great military leader if even his own mother won\'t listen to him. She reluctantly reinserts the chip back into the Terminator\'s head.A scene at a truck stop before John, Sarah and Terminator arrive at the Salceda farm. John points out to the Terminator that he shouldn\'t be so serious all the time. He encourages him to smile once in a while. The Terminator tries to perform a smile, but the result is less than convincing, so John encourages him to practice in front of a mirror.Directly after Terminator tells Sarah about Miles Dyson, there is a scene where Dyson is seen in his private residence, where his wife tells him he is much too focused on finishing his microchip, and Miles explains how his design will revolutionize artificial intelligence.Some more dialogue between John and the Terminator as they assemble weapons in the desert. John tells about his unusual childhood, and ask Terminator if he experiences emotions.Before Sarah takes aim at Dyson, she is seen approaching the house and setting up weapons.A scene in Cyberdyne, where Dyson destroys the model of his revolutionary microchip.In the steel mill, the T-1000 experiences some negative effects from being frozen earlier. It has difficulties maintaining his form when it touches other materials, like steel bars and the floor. This leads to another deleted shot, where John sees the two Sarahs and recognizes the fake one because its feet seem fused to the metal floor.A scene in a Skynet-free future, with Sarah Connor as an older woman giving a monologue about how Judgment Day no longer occurred, and John becoming a senator. This scene was NOT included in the SE, because James Cameron felt it just didn\'t fit the dark, gloomy atmosphere of the rest of the movie.', u'Arnold Schwarzenegger said during the making of this film that he would never play another evil character again, but he later played the villain Mr. Freeze in Batman & Robin (1997).', u""The name of Arnold Schwarzenegger's Terminator is the Terminator Series 800 (shiny metal endoskeleton) model 101 (Arnold's actual skin on that skeleton)."", u'Because of the amount of make-up Arnold Schwarzenegger had to wear for the climax, he was blinded in one eye and had no depth perception.', u""The special effects crew had to incorporate Robert Patrick's football-injury limp in their animation of the T-1000.

For all of the mayhem and violence in this movie, sixteen (at the most) characters actually die, and only one of these by gunfire. Of the people who get killed, there are three soldiers, the armored truck driver and his gunner, the cop on patrol, Lewis the guard, a mall employee, Todd and Janelle Voight, the cop on the motorcycle (copied by T-1000 and therefore implied to have been terminated off-screen), Dr. Miles Bennett Dyson, and the tanker truck driver. The trucker pulled from his truck by T-1000 as he is in pursuit of John makes a bad fall, but probably survived. It\'s not exactly certain if the police helicopter pilot dies (he falls from a high place but may have suffered only some broken bones). The pickup truck driver is probably not in danger of dying as he does not jump off of the bridge, but only jumps over the center divider in the middle of the bridge. A subplot was scripted where the T-1000 tracks down Enrique Salceda and kills him, but it was not filmed and not alluded to in the finished movie (Sarah even suggest that he go into hiding himself). The T-1000 is directly or indirectly responsible for most of the deaths. The Terminator only injures people. According to a biographical documentary, Arnold Schwarzenegger only agreed to do the sequel if his role was more family-friendly, hence the ""no killing"" rule written for his character. However, on the DVD audio commentary, James Cameron states that he had to convince Schwarzenegger that his character could no longer kill people.', u""Because of Edward Furlong's small stature during filming, his stunt double, who was older and larger, used a bigger version of the dirt bike for filming the chase scene."", u""When John takes off on his motorbike from the mall chased by the T-1000, he is riding a Honda XR 80 or 100, which has a 4-cycle engine.

Cameron did not write or direct the following sequels and was only credited as the creator of the characters.', u'Scenes in the screenplay but not filmed: - Extended Future War sequence where the resistance wins and enters a SkyNet lab where they find the time-portal and a storage facilities of Terminators. Reese talks to John before he volunteers to be sent through time; it is implied that Reese learns that he is in fact John\'s father. After Reese is sent, John enters a storage cabinet full of Terminators (different types even). One of the 101-models is missing (being the Terminator from the first movie). John hints that he needs to send another one himself. After that, the rest of the movie is effectively one long flashback of John. - Sarah\'s ECT where Sarah is fitted for electro-convulsive therapy and voltage is pumped into her. She relives several moments from her life, most prominently the T-800 chasing her through the factory in the previous film. - Alternate nuclear nightmare scene. Sarah dreams that the Terminator takes her out of the asylum towards the fence, where she sees nuclear silos opening, firing their missiles. One nuclear bomb goes off, ripping off both her flesh and the Terminator\'s. Then she wakes up. - Salceda\'s death sequence. Sal\'s dog starts barking, Sal goes out tries to shoot the T-1000 and fails. T-1000 uses the pointed finger/sword trick to Sal\'s shoulder blades saying ""I know this hurts. Where is John Connor"". Sal curses him and his hands search around the ground near some crates that hold grenades. He blows himself up and hopefully the T-1000 with one. No luck. T-1000 head falls off but like the little piece in the asylum escape sequence, it oozes back into his boots. Yolanda sees this and hugs the baby as T-1000 steps closer. T-1000 picks up the baby and gets the info from her as where John and others had gone. - Gant Ranch. This section was a longer version of Sal\'s and refers to Travis Gant, ""crazy ex-Green Beret"" that John mentions his mother seeing before she was caught. Longer and has romantic notions between the two. After Sarah, John and the Terminator left, T-1000 kills Gant as he did like with John\'s ""Mom"". Disguised as Gant\'s lover, he easily stepped up to him and tortured him for answers before killing him. Dyson\'s Vision Sequence. Dyson, the creator of the new processor had a dream sequence before he died and dropped the device on the trigger. In it he saw a picture of his family before a nuclear inferno turned it to ash.

However, that doesn\'t happen in the movie.', u'Michael Ironside and Mickey Jones were also cast members in the tv series ""V"".', u""Although the film was given the 18 certificate in England and the MA15+ rating in Australia for it's graphic violence. The film was given the M rating in New Zealand. M means Suitable for Mature Audience 16 years and over which means anyone above the age of 16 can watch the movie. However, the graphic sequences of violence, blood and gore that occurs throughout the film was too strong for the M rating."", u'Although Johnnycab is clearly a robot, he apparently has feelings, as when his taxicab pulls up and Douglas Quaid gets out, Johnnycab says, ""The fare is 18 credits, please"". Quaid cheekily replies, ""Sue me, dickhead!"" Johnnycab cab feels insulted as he tries to run Quaid down in his cab, but it crashes and explodes, so Quaid dives for cover. Johnnycab then says, ""We hope you enjoyed the ride!""', u'Thumberlina (Debbie Lee Carrington) has only 1 line in the movie. When Melina takes Quaid to her room at The Last Resort, she says ""No problem. If you need any help with this one, give me a holler.""', u'As director Paul Verhoeven is careful to explain on the DVD commentary, when Dr. Edgemar (Roy Brocksmith) visits Quaid, he outlines the entire third act of the movie. He says that if Quaid kills him: ""the walls of reality will come crashing down"" (moments after Quaid shoots Edgemar, the walls of the apartment literally crash down); he says that Quaid will believe himself the savior of the resistance only to discover that he is in fact Cohaagen\'s ""bosom buddy"" (which is exactly what happens); and he says that he will have visions of an ""alien civilization"" (which Quaid experiences during the mind meld with Kuato). Verhoeven points out that if a viewer believes the whole film is a dream, then Edgemar\'s prediction that Quaid will end up being lobotomized is fulfilled in the fade to white which ends the movie.', u'The final scene fading into white is intentionally done by Paul Verhoeven to leave some question marks regarding whether everything was a dream and Quaid got lobotomized in the end.', u'On three separate occasions, if you pay close attention, various characters give the ending of the movie away: 1) When Bob McClane pitches the Secret Agent Ego Trip to Quaid, he tells him that by the time his trip is over he\'ll ""get the girl, kill the bad guys, and save the entire planet!"" 2) When Dr. Lull tosses Ernie a computer chip, he looks at it and says ""That\'s a new one! \'Blue Sky on Mars\'."" And finally 3) When Quaid threatens to shoot Dr. Edgemar in the Hilton suite, Edgemar describes the events that will happen almost verbatim throughout the rest of the movie.', u'When filming the fight scene between Lori and Melina, director Paul Verhoeven asked Second Unit Director Vic Armstrong to choreograph the fight not as a ""cat fight"" but more like a martial arts fight, to give the feel of two ""warriors"" fighting each other and not simply two women. Verhoeven remarks in the DVD commentary that this is probably the first time in a feature film where we see two women fighting each other normally, as opposed to a cat fight.', u""Director Paul Verhoeven wanted to make the ending of the movie completely ambiguous so as the audiences would still not know even at the end of the movie if it was all a dream or if it did really happen. According to Verhoeven himself, he believed the ending was in fact a dream, but at the same time, he also said that the casting of Arnold Schwarzenegger as the lead role was also leaning towards reality, as most audiences who go to see a Schwarzenegger movie would be in favor of a 'reality' ending as opposed to a 'dream' ending."", u'It took 15 puppeteers to control Kuato, whose name is from the Spanish word ""cuate"" (""twin""). In Imagining \'Total Recall\' (2001), director Paul Verhoeven said that special makeup effects designer Rob Bottin had made the Kuato puppet look so real that he was approached by two people on the street asking if he (Marshall Bell) was a ""real freak"" or possibly a semi-born Siamese twin.', u'When Quaid fights with Harry and his men after visiting Rekall, the sounds of bones being broken are actually celery being twisted and snapped.', u'The design for the alien reactor that melts the ice and gives Mars air at the end of the movie was based on a nuclear reactor. According to Paul Verhoeven, he wanted to ""be inside a nuclear reactor"" (with poles going into water), but wanted to make it to a much grander scale, with the poles being as big as skyscrapers. Both he and William Sandell found a book that had pictures of skyscrapers that were built around the turn of the 20th century, which had potential for the reactor design, but initially neither of them were convinced that idea would work, so they dejectedly threw the book on the ground. It landed in such a way that the skyscraper pictures were upside down, and both Verhoeven and Sandell looked and realized that upside down, the skyscrapers had the right look for the alien reactor.', u""Arnold Schwarzenegger suffered several hand-related injuries during the shoot. When filming the scene where Quaid smashes a train window, a tiny explosive in the glass was supposed to shatter it a fraction of a second before Schwarzenegger struck it, but it didn't go off and Schwarzenegger hit the glass for real, badly cutting himself. When filming the fight scene inside Quaid's Hilton suite (immediately after Quaid shoots Dr. Edgemar), Schwarzenegger broke a finger on his right hand and had to get a cast fitted. As a result, most of his scenes shot afterward kept his injured hand off-screen."", u'Regardless of whether people believe the movie as a whole is a dream or reality, according to Paul Verhoeven, the first 20 minutes or so of the movie (from the beginning up until the point where Quaid first undergoes the implantation of his Rekall vacation implant) is all reality.', u'The scene where the air to the Mars colony is cut off was initially shot with the Martians violently gasping for oxygen. However, this gave the scene an unintentionally comical feeling. It was director of photography Jost Vacano who suggested to have the actors lying down quietly while fighting to survive, in order to give the scene a much more dramatic tone. He remembered how effective this had been when he shot a similar scene in Das Boot (1981) in the same way.', u'After Quaid shoots Lori, he says ""Consider that a divorce."" According to Dan O\'Bannon, in the original script Quaid says ""Consider THIS a divorce"" and then shoots Lori. This was ultimately changed to what appears on film because O\'Bannon and others thought it was ""a bit too cold-blooded"".', u'Body count: 77', u'Right before Quaid falls asleep he gives instructions to the Rekall technicians as to the characteristics of his dream girl. The picture of Melina appears on the screen from the already existing archives of Rekall.', u'Over 40 drafts of the script had already been written when Paul Verhoeven agreed to read the screenplay. Some of them depicted Quaid as a mild-mannered accountant (instead of a construction worker). Most scripts had a similar first half (Quaid visits Rekall and starts having altered memories), but they all varied widely in the ending. One of them even had Quaid discover that he was really an alien in human disguise (a twist that may have been inspired by another Philip K. Dick short story, ""Impostor"" later filmed as Impostor (2001)). Verhoeven finally brought in Gary Goldman for additional work on the script. According to Verhoeven, although there were many changes made to each of the scripts, the final draft was very similar to the first draft by Ronald Shusett.', u'Marshall Bell had a full-body make-up for the Kuato scenes. The head of Kuato was fully animatronic.', u""During filming, Sharon Stone complained to director Paul Verhoeven that she wasn't sure whether her character really was married to Doug."", u'When Quaid is being shown the monitor in the implant room, some of the drawings scrolling by are concept drawings of the reactor on Mars.', u""Benny the cab driver says he wishes he had three hands while fondling the triple-breasted prostitute. In fact, he does. He has a normal hand, a mutant hand which is revealed to gain Quaid's trust, and a robotic snap-on hand to hide his mutant hand."", u'According to Ronald Shusett, back when the movie was originally being produced by Dino De Laurentiis, De Laurentiis had planned to shoot the ending completely differently from the original script, because he felt the concept of Mars getting air was just ""too difficult to visualize"". This didn\'t sit well with Shusett, and the two had many arguments over it, even escalating to the point that Shusett had threatened to cancel the movie altogether, stating that he\'d rather not see the movie get made if it\'s the way he intended it to be made. Di Laurentiis eventually saw the error in his judgment when he suggested to director Richard Rush about altering the ending, to which Rush replied that he was ""full of shit"" and convinced him not to cut or alter the ending. Di Laurentiis even approached Shusett, apologizing for giving him such a hard time and saying ""Ron, you so stubborn I kiss you in the mouth! You save me!"" Di Laurentiis never did get to produce the movie, because his production company went bankrupt shortly afterwards and the project ended up being sold to Mario Kassar\'s Carolco Pictures (at the request of Arnold Schwarzenegger).', u'Dr. Edgemar is the narrator of the Recall ad on the screens while Quaid rides the subway.', u'Quaid\'s metal briefcase contains the following items: a worker\'s ID for the Pyramid Mines on Mars under the name ""Steve Leonetti"", a driver\'s license under the name ""James D. Brubaker"", several other miscellaneous ID cards, a large sum of pink Martian dollar bills, an unusual medical device (later used to extract the bug from inside Quaid\'s head), a portable wrist-worn hologram generator, a laptop-like video communication device, various clothes (possibly the fat lady outfit), and a piece of paper with the name ""HOFFMAN"" written on it, who\'s purpose is never revealed (possibly Quaid\'s passenger ticket to Mars?).', u'CASTLE THUNDER: Can be heard mixed with other sound effects during the scenes where the alien reactor is melting the ice, and the mountain explodes.', u""According to Bob McClane and the display screen, Quaid's Mars Vacation Package includes the following: Private cabin on the Mars-bound shuttle, Two weeks accommodations at a deluxe suite at the Mars Hilton, three meals a day at a 5-star restaurant, romantic encounters, personal tour guide to Mt. Olympus, Pyramid Mountain, the Grand Canals, and Venusville. Counting the Secret Agent Ego Trip addition, Quaid's vacation costs a total of 1199 credits (899 for the standard vacation and 300 for the Ego Trip addition), which would later be refunded after Quaid's schizoid embolism incident."", u""When Dr. Edgemar meets Quaid, there is a shot where both men stand in the center of the room and only Quaid's reflection is seen in the mirror on the right whereas, as said, they both stand at the same spot. This can be regarded as foreshadowing the fact that the Dr. Edgemar is not on Quaid's side, that he's a traitor."", u'There are a few references to the fate of Benny the cab driver. Twice Benny is nearly killed by the giant drill machines. When he is exposed as a traitor, Benny tries to kill Quaid with a drill machine. Quaid then kills him by stabbing him with a portable drill.', u'Puppets of Arnold Schwarzenegger, Rachel Ticotin and Ronny Cox were made and used for the scenes where Quaid, Rachel and Cohaggen are dying of explosive decompression.', u'Like The Fly II (1989), when the film premiered on the ITV network in 1992 it was broadcast uncut and uncensored. All the graphic scenes of gore and violence in the film were left intact. In both films, characters both die from accidents involving an elevator. In The Fly II, the character Hargis gets his head crushed by an elevator. In Total Recall, Richter loses both his arms and falls to his death in a fight with Quaid.', u'In the scene which Quaid is about to be implanted with the Mars vacation memory implant. Ernie, Dr. Lull\'s assistant says ""That\'s a new one. Blue sky on mars."" A foreshadowing of the film\'s ending which Mars sky turns from red to blue when the reactor releases oxygen onto the planet and this hints that everything that happened in the film could very well be a dream.', u'In the ending scene, if you watch closely when Arnold Schwarzenegger is kissing Rachel Ticotin. In the background behind Arnold Schwarzengger on the right, a Coca-Cola can which was painted in gray can be seen. The Coca-Cola can was put in the model of the Mars colony by Ian Hunter to see if it would pass.', u'In the scene where Quaid is in the implant chair at Rekall and is about to be given the memory implant of the vacation on Mars. Dr. Lull gives Ernie a microchip which Ernie says ""That\'s a new one. Blue sky on Mars"". This is a foreshadowing of the film\'s climax which the sky on Mars turns from red to blue when Quaid activates the reactor and the planet is terrorformed allowing the colonists to breathe on the planet. This hints that everything happens on Mars and on Earth could be a dream.', u""The film's graphic violent scenes were trimmed down so the film could secure an R rating. Among the scenes that were trimmed down were: Benny's death. The innocent bystander being used a shield. Helm's death when Thumbelina stabs and kills him with a bowie knife. Scientists being killed by Quaid when he breaks free from the implant machine and Richter's arms being severed."", u""It was rumored that in the original X rated cut of the film, Benny's death was more graphic and explicit and that Benny's guts were seen falling out his stomach when Quaid kills him with the industrial power drill."", u'Arnold Schwarzenegger wore stunt pads to protect his genitals when they filmed the fight scene between Quaid and Lori which Lori (Sharon Stone) elbows and kicks Quaid (Schwarzenegger) in the genitals.', u""One of Harry's goons is played by stuntman Allan Graf, who had a small part in action thriller Red Heat (1988), also starring Arnold Schwarzenegger."", u'When Quaid goes in the Martian train, he has a little conversation with a man about the pyramid mountain. This man was played by Mickey Jones, who played Chris Farber in V (1984) as buddy of Ham Tyler, played by Michael Ironside.

His compatriot in the movie, a character named ""Stevie"" and played by Dweezil Zappa, is an obvious homage to Stevie Nicks of Fleetwood Mac.', u""Arnold Schwarzenegger thought Paul Michael Glaser was a terrible choice to direct, what with Glaser coming from a TV background, and having no film experience as a director at all. He thought Glaser shot this film like a TV show, losing all of the script's deeper themes; Schwarzenegger suspected that because Glaser was a last-minute replacement, he didn't have time to research this future he was depicting, unlike James Cameron had with The Terminator (1984); also in television, they hire you and the very next week you shoot, so he didn't place all of the blame at Glaser's feet."", u'This film is based VERY loosely on the novel of the same name by Stephen King (writing as Richard Bachman). Specific differences include: The novel takes place in the year 2025. This film takes place in 2019, according to the DVD cover, two years after the collapse of world economy in 2017 advertised following the film title sequence. While this film takes place in California, the novel takes place on the northeastern coast of the United States, tracing Richards from Co-Op City, NY, to Boston, MA; from Boston to Manchester, NH; and from Manchester to Portland and Derry, ME (the former being Stephen King\'s hometown, the latter being the fictional primary setting for King\'s novels ""It"". ""Dreamcatcher"", ""Insomnia"" and ""Bag of Bones""); then from Derry back to New York. Richards enters the game willingly, as opposed to being forced to, in order to acquire money for his ailing infant daughter. He is deemed an enemy of the state and receives $100 for every hour he stays alive over a period of 30 days, an additional $100 for every law enforcement officer or ""Hunter"" (not ""Stalker"") he kills, and one billion in ""New Dollars"" (worth far more than original American dollars). As opposed to being confined to the site of an earthquake in California in the film, Richards can travel anywhere in the world to evade the Hunters, but must videotape two messages per day and courier them to the Games Network or forfeit his money. Richards, a Caucasian male, shows signs of racism early on in the novel, but is taken in by the Throckmortons, an African-American family in Boston, and after he is told of the situation the government forces them to live in, decides to help them. Laughlin is a Caucasian, and enters the tournament willingly, as does Richards. Laughlin eventually meets his end in Topeka, KS, where police burn the shed he hides in. Dan Killian (called Damon Killian in the film) is an African-American. Killian is also the producer of ""The Running Man,"" not the host. Unlike in the film, the only Hunter mentioned by name in the novel is Evan McCone, the chief Hunter, who is eventually shot dead by Richards. While in Boston, Richards escapes his pursuers by setting fire to a YMCA he is hiding in and narrowly escapes through a sewer pipe. The resulting fire kills five police officers. The ending is far more dire in the novel than in the film. In Derry, Richards carjacks a woman named Amelia Williams and makes his way to Derry\'s airport, hijacking a plane, where he also takes McCone hostage. As in the film, Richards is given the chance to become leader Hunter (much to McCone\'s chagrin) by Killian, though unlike in the film he accepts. He is later given the terrible news that both his wife and daughter had been killed even before he had even first appeared on ""The Running Man,"" giving him time to ponder the offer more. Feeling he has nothing left to lose, Richards overpowers the flight crew and kills McCone, but is mortally wounded in the process. Setting Williams free via a parachute, Richards makes a suicide run on the Games Building in New York, killing Killian and everybody inside.', u'Erland van Lidth (""Dynamo"") was a classically trained Helden baritone opera singer, so in his introduction when Dynamo is singing an aria from ""The Marriage of Figaro"", it actually is van Lidth singing.', u'""The Running Man"" suit that the contestants wear bears an Adidas logo at the hip and right arm.', u""Prior to Paul Michael Glaser being hired as director, executive producer Rob Cohen had hired four other directors in his attempts to make the movie. The first was George P. Cosmatos, who had impressed Cohen with his work on Rambo: First Blood Part II (1985). However, when Cosmatos announced that he wanted to relocate the entire film to a shopping mall, Cohen let him go, feeling that Cosmatos was taking the script in an unacceptable direction. Cohen next offered the project to German director Carl Schenkel, having been impressed with Pelon tunnit (1984), but Schenkel turned him down as he didn't feel comfortable taking on such a large project. Next, Cohen hired Ferdinand Fairfax, based upon his work on Savage Islands (1983). Like Cosmatos, however, Fairfax began to take the screenplay in a direction which Cohen disliked, so once again, he let him go. Cohen then turned to Andrew Davis, having enjoyed Davis' movie Code of Silence (1985). Davis actually got the project off the ground and into production, but only eight days into the shoot, he was already $8 million over budget and four days behind schedule. As such Cohen let Davis go, and ultimately hired Glaser, whom he had worked with on the first season of Miami Vice (1984)."", u'Arnold Schwarzenegger (trademark): ""I\'ll be back!""', u'In Killian\'s office there is a poster for a fake TV show called ""Hate Boat.""

In Wayne's World (1992), Garth Algar (Dana Carvey) hacks a satellite so he can transmit a live broadcast of the Wayne's World TV show into the TV of Frankie Sharp's limo. In this film, Mick (Mick Fleetwood) and the resistance hack the network satellite so they can transmit the unedited footage of the Bakersfield massacre on The Running Man, which the unedited footage proves Ben Richards (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is innocent and that he did not mass murder the 1500 unarmed civilians."", u'During the takeover of the network, Mick makes a reference to Spock from Star Trek (1966), to which the reply is ""Who\'s Spock?"". The filmmakers obviously thought that ""Star Trek"" would be decommissioned by 2017 when the film is set, so the younger characters in the film wouldn\'t know what it was. In real life, Leonard Nimoy portrayed the character until his final appearance in Star Trek: Into Darkness (2013), which was released two years prior to his death in 2015 where he shared a scene with a younger version of himself. As of 2016 (with the franchise now 50 years old), the Star Trek franchise is still around with the 2009 Kelvin timeline films and a TV series planned for a Spring 2017 release on CBS with Rod Roddenberry (Gene Roddenberry\'s son) as executive producer.', u'It\'s unclear how Amber was able to smuggle the video of the raw unedited footage of the Bakersfield massacre in her spandex suit after she gets caught looking through the various media information folders. However, when Richards asks her how she smuggled it and she replies ""none of your business"" with a sly smile.', u'Foreshadowing of what\'s going to happen to the stalkers: when the agent (\'Ken Lerner\') decides to ""help"" Ben Richards (Arnold Schwarzenegger), when he\'s ready to sign his contract - to agree to partake in The Running Man - by saying, ""Here, here here. Use my back, victim"". So once Richards has signed, he stabs the pen through the contract so hard that it sticks into the agent\'s back and he shrieks in pain. ""Don\'t forget to send me a copy"", quips Richards and the agent shrieks in pain even louder then disappears. During the game show Richards kills Subzero (Prof. Toru Tanaka) by strangling him with barbed wire, overpowers Buzzsaw (Gus Rethwisch) by shoving his chainsaw up into his crotch, ultimately killing him and takes down Fireball (\'Jim Brown\') by pulling his gas line out, causing fuel to leak everywhere, knocks Fireball back, tosses a lit flare at him and he dies in the resulting explosion. Richards also kills Damon Killian (\'Richard Dawson\') after surviving the game, by sending him down the tunnel in a sled, there\'s no net to catch it this time, so Killian crashes into a billboard with him on it advertising coke and - like Fireball before him - dies in the resulting explosion. Dynamo (\'Erland Van Lidth\') chases Richards in his car, but follows him up a steep slope, overturns and gets trapped. Richards was going to kill him but doesn\'t, as he wouldn\'t kill a helpless human being. Later at ICS Amber Mendez (Maria Conchita Alonzo) manages to kill Dynamo during his rape attempt, by grabbing her gun on the floor, shooting at water sprinklers in the ceiling and ultimately electrocuting Dynamo.', u'When the film aired on the TV3 network in New Zealand in the early 1990s, scenes were edited for graphic violence and bad language: Digo\'s head exploding in the prison breakout sequence was removed. Killian telling Tony to tell the Justice Department to ""go F themselves"" when he arrives at the ICS building. Ben saying ""F you!"" to Killian is removed in the scene which Killian meets Ben. The graphic close-up shot of Sub-Zero being killed by Ben with the barb wire is removed.

All of the night scenes were filmed during freezing cold temperatures, which was especially hard on Arnold Schwarzenegger during the latter half of the film, when the mud he had to wear (actually pottery clay) became cold and wet. He was warned it would take his body temperature down a few degrees, and he shivered non-stop, even when they tried to heat him with lamps (it just made the clay dry out). He tried drinking jagertee, a schnapps mixture, to warm him, but that just got him drunk.', u'After Dutch impales a bad guy against a wooden post with his machete, he utters the immortal one-liner ""Stick around!"" This was apparently improvised by Arnold Schwarzenegger.', u'The original concept for this film originated as a joke. Someone said that the only person Rocky Balboa of the Rocky franchise had yet to fight, was E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982).', u'Jean-Claude Van Damme was originally cast to play the Predator the idea being that the physical action star would use his martial arts to make the Predator an agile, ninja-Raquel Hunter,but he was dropped for being too short, at 5\'9"", Arnold Schwarzenegger and his team are bodybuilders who are between 6\'2"" and 6\'5"". Additionally it was reported that Jean-Claude Van Damme constantly complained about the monster suit being too hot, causing him to pass out. He also had allegedly voiced his reservations on numerous occasions regarding the fact he would not be appearing on camera without the suit. Additionally the original design for the Predator was felt to be too cumbersome and difficult to manage in the jungle and, even with a more imposing actor was felt to not provoke enough fear. Van Damme was removed from the film and replaced by Kevin Peter Hall.', u'According to an interview with Director John McTiernan, the ""hole in the jungle"" appearance of the Predator, was played by Jean-Claude Van Damme in a ""bluescreen"" (actually red) suit. Van Damme quit after two days, unhappy with being cast as an uncredited special effect, but can be seen as the Predator in If It Bleeds We Can Kill It: The Making of \'Predator\' (2001). The alien was scrapped, redesigned, and was eventually played by Kevin Peter Hall who was 7\'2"" tall.', u'The Predator was first designed by a special effects company the studio picked to save money. Stan Winston later created the Predator for 1.5 million dollars. This other studio charged half that amount. Because of that, their Predator looked like someone in a lizard suit, with the head of a duck, according to Arnold Schwarzenegger. When Winston was brought in to redesign the Predator, the final fight scene had to be re-shot. The new Predator was 8-1/2 feet tall, but the re-cast Kevin Peter Hall was 7\'2"". The costume was heavy and off-balance, and Hall couldn\'t see with the mask on. Because of that, during the fight scene with Dutch, he actually did hit Schwarzenegger once.', u""John McTiernan didn't like Puerto Vallarta, because the brown leaves made it look less like a jungle."", u""Part of the shoot was forty-eight hours before Arnold Schwarzenegger's wedding rehearsal dinner. Jesse Ventura teased him about his nuptials, often ruining takes; John McTiernan was not amused. Schwarzenegger missed the final preparation, and Maria Shriver was not happy about that, because his mind was more on the film, instead of their wedding."", u""The Predator's blood - a goopy substance with the color of Mountain Dew - was made on-set using a mixture of the liquid from inside glow sticks, and KY Jelly."", u""The weapon that Blain (Jesse Ventura) is using is a minigun. This is a weapon most commonly mounted on the side of a helicopter (or an aircraft carrier) and many, many modifications had to be made to make it usable in the film. It was powered via an electrical cable hidden down the front of Blain's trousers. The firing rate was slowed down to approximately one-third the normal rate of fire, both to reduce consumption of blanks, and to make the spinning of the barrels visible on film. It is rumored that Ventura had to wear a bulletproof vest, because of the forceful ejection of spent cartridges, but this is false. Unmodified miniguns eject out of the bottom, with the cases essentially falling out, due to gravity. Close examination of the film, especially the scene in which Mac fires the minigun at the fleeing predator, along with the other commandos, show that the ejection of the minigun was not changed."", u'Peter Cullen was reluctant to take the job of voicing the Predator, as he injured his throat playing the title character of King Kong (1976), but eventually accepted, after seeing a picture of the unmasked creature.', u'Arnold Schwarzenegger recommended Jesse Ventura for Blain, after interviewing him for the role. He thought he looked the part, was big enough, had a deep voice, and was manly.', u'The famous clicking and gurgling sound, the Predator makes throughout the movie, was thought up by Peter Cullen. After the producers approached him to give the Predator ""a voice"", he was taken aback, because he had no idea what something like that was suppose to sound like, not to mention that the producers were reluctant to show what the character was finally going to look like, they relented, and Cullen, who thought the Predator creature resembled a ""horseshoe crab"", remembered as a kid, how if you turned one over, they would ""gurgle"", and that became the Predator\'s ""sound"".', u'Arnold Schwarzenegger lost over twenty-five pounds before filming began, in order to better fit the role of a special warfare operative, who would be lean, as well as muscular.', u'Shane Black hated the glasses he was given to wear as Hawkins. He wanted to wear authentic military-issue ballistic glasses, worn by actual troops in the field, but John McTiernan wanted him to look as geeky as possible.', u'The Sound Editors called the Predator\'s shoulder gun, the ""Parrot Gun"", because when it moved independent of the Predator while aiming, it reminded them of ""Peter Sellers with a rubber parrot on his shoulder.""', u'The mandibles of the Predator were the idea of James Cameron.', u'An attempt was made to get shots of the Predator swinging from tree to tree using a monkey in a red special effects suit. However, the monkey kept removing the suit, and the idea was abandoned.', u'Due to health and safety regulations, Arnold Schwarzenegger was not allowed to light his cigar inside the helicopter near the beginning of the film. As a result the glow was added optically in post-production.', u""In an interview, Carl Weathers said the actors would secretly wake up, as early as 3:00 a.m., to work out before the day's shooting. Weathers also stated that he would act as if his physique was naturally given to him, and would work out only after the other actors were nowhere to be seen."", u""Because this was the first Predator movie, only the thermal vision and infrared vision was shown from the Predator's point of view (Predator 2 (1990) introduced many other vision modes for the Predator), but with good attention to details, you can get hints that the Predator has different vision modes, even in this movie; The Predator can obviously see, and avoid the trip wires that are hidden everywhere in the forest (which would actually not be visible if the Predator only used thermal vision). The Predator can also see if the soldiers are carrying any kind of weapons, or knives, and if they are unarmed, indicating the Predator has a different vision mode, which makes him able to detect solid metal."", u""Hawkins was originally supposed to wear a distinctive red beret, most likely inspired by the U.S. Army's maroon airborne berets, worn by American paratroopers. Shane Black refused to wear it, as he thought it would look ridiculous in the jungle. He later regretted the decision, as he felt it would have made his character stand out."", u""Most of the cast and crew suffered from traveller's diarrhea, since the Mexican hotel, in which they were living, was having problems with water purification. The only ones who didn't get sick, were Arnold Schwarzenegger and John McTiernan."", u'Carl Weathers joked in an interview, that Arnold Schwarzenegger got him addicted to cigar smoking during filming. Arnold, famous for smoking cigars, offered Weathers to smoke one, who initially declined, because he was a non-smoker from his pro-football player days, but eventually gave in. Once he tried it, Arnold gave him an entire box full of cigars. Weathers ended this part of the interview by looking to the camera and cheerfully declaring ""Shame on you Arnold! Shame on you!""', u""The studio's insurance company would not agree to insure the production, unless a bodyguard was hired for Sonny Landham (Billy) for the sole purpose of protecting people from Sonny. The bodyguard followed Sonny around everywhere, to ensure that Sonny didn't get into a fight, since he was well known to be a very violent, and short tempered, actor."", u'The ""B"" camera was given a reel of incorrect film stock, which is why some shots look a lot grainier than others.', u""The studio would not allow John McTiernan to shoot this film in anamorphic widescreen, due to the complexities of the optical effects. As a sly sort of retaliation, he added an anamorphic version of the film's opening 20th Century Fox logo, which looks noticeably stretched on-screen."", u'Shane Black spent his free time on the set writing the screenplay for The Last Boy Scout (1991).', u'The original plot had Dutch Schaefer (Arnold Schwarzenegger) pitted against the Predator alone.

In addition, Sonny Landham (Republican) ran an unsuccessful campaign for Governor of Kentucky in 2003. Landham and Ventura also sought to enter the Senate in 2008 in their states as, respectively, a Libertarian and an Independent. Both dropped out.', u'Kevin Peter Hall stated in an interview, that his experience on the film, ""wasn\'t a movie, it was a survival story for all of us."" For example, in the scene where the Predator chases Dutch, the water was foul, stagnant, and full of leeches.', u'This film had the second biggest opening weekend of 1987; Beverly Hills Cop II (1987) had the first.', u'The map General Phillips uses to brief Dutch, is a map of Brazil. The area that the map shows, is a region known as ""cerrado biome"", in core areas with small and medium trees, wooded savanna, and gramineous-woody savanna. Given that, the big tropical forests with deep ravines and huge trees are geographically incorrect, once that featured region on the map is called Chapada das Mangabeiras, in the plateaus in the center of Brazil. This point is rendered moot, however, by the fact that the countries, in which the film takes place, are never identified in the course of the movie.', u'All the actors are wearing Vietnam-era surplus canvas load-bearing gear, not the more modern (post-1967) nylon gear.', u'One of the elements in the sound of the ""snap"" to Predator-vision is a whip crack.', u'The original ""Hunter"" model was a large creature with a long neck, a head shaped like a dog, and one big eye in the middle.

It was only when Stan Winston moved in, that the complete design of the ""Predator"" changed, along with the title.', u'Although they were never mentioned in the final film, the full names of the main characters in the original script Were Major Alan ""Dutch"" Schaefer, Staff Sergeant George Dillon, Sergeant Mac Eliot, Sergeant Blain Cooper, Sergeant Billy Sole, Corporal Poncho Ramirez, and Corporal Rick Hawkins.', u'John McTiernan was keen to make the comrade banter between the soldiers as real as possible. To help this along, the cast trained together on-location with weapons, fitness and a military training regiment, that started at 6 a.m. every day, and included the use of communication with the silent, military hand signals that we see so much in the movie. He stated that ""even though many of the cast had military backgrounds"", he ""wanted them all to get a chance to know each other, develop as a group, and endure something rough, and conquer it together.""', u'Third film in which Arnold Schwarzenegger wears a Seiko model H558-5009 diver\'s watch.

Schwarzenegger's weight loss was a professional choice. McTiernan lost the weight, because he avoided the food in Mexico, due to health concerns unlike McTiernan most of the cast and crew sufferes from travelers diarrhea since the Mexican hotel in which they were living was having problems with the water purification. In an interview, Carl Weathers said the actors would secretly wake up as early as 3 a.m. to work out before the day shooting, Weather's also stated that he would act as if his physique was naturally given to him, and would work out only after the other actors were nowhere to be seen."", u'Arnold Schwarzenegger never worked again with Joel Silver after this film.', u'Film debut of Jesse Ventura.', u'The film originally featured a Native American soldier as the lead.

They got the idea from this movie and Predator 2 (1990). The first time that people see the Predator in his cloak, he is reaching for the foot of one of Arnold\'s guys that just got wasted. The idea behind the camouflage, was not to appear invisible, but to replicate what is on the opposite side. In the Department of Defense\'s test footage, when you look at the person wearing the camo (fiber-optic sheet), he or she simply appeared to look like a heat wave.', u'Arnold Schwarzenegger ""wanted to do a film like The Magnificent Seven (1960), where a team of guys work together.""', u'Shane Black came up with the coarse jokes that he tells in the film.', u'The screenwriters\' intent was to ""strip away elements of the modern, organized world.

As a result, it was redesigned to be far more simple and plain. The original rejected mask prop was later reused for a hunter in Predator 2 (1990) and would go on to inspire the masks worn by Celtic in Alien vs. Predator (2004) and Scarface in the video game Predator:Concrete Jungle (2005).

The animatronic face on the hero head was controlled by a set of 9 servomotors that enabled motion of the brow area and mandibles, as well as ""a cheek squint"", an additional external servomotor was added later, hidden in the creatures backpack, to move the lower mandibles, which previously did not open as widely as intended. Kevin Peter Hall was able to puppeteer the creature\'s mouth with his own jaw, and wore contact lenses to finish the effect.', u'The invisibility cloaking effect was achieved by having someone wearing a bright red suit (because it was the farthest opposite of the green of the jungle and the blue of the sky) the size of the Predator.

When the two takes were combined optically, the jungle from the second take filled in the empty area.

In the book it is a shape-shifter, able to mimic any form it chooses just the slightest physical contact, and even capable of dissipating entirely, vanishing and becoming part of the blowing breeze. And its basic form it is a tall humanoid creature with crimson scaly skin and three fingered hands. It's only weapons are a telescoping spear that it throws (incidentally similar to the combistick from Predator 2) and a static spider web-like trap capable of shredding anything caught in it (similar to the net fired by the Netgun in Predator 2) instead of a cloak, the predator uses its shape-shifting ability and chameleon-like skin to hide the Predator is also able to possess any animal its chooses (but not humans, one of the reasons it is so interested in them.) It's blood is translucent and amber in color instead of green, although it still glows at night.

He spent hours at the shooting range and practicing with different weapons without blinking or looking at them when reloading or cocking. He also had to be ambidextrous. He practiced different moves up to 50 times. He wound up garnering a compliment in ""Soldier of Fortune"" magazine for his realistic handling of the guns on camera (whereas the magazine usually lampoons movies for their inaccurate depictions of weapons use).', u""The beginning of production was postponed for nine months, due to Arnold Schwarzenegger's commitment to Conan the Destroyer (1984). During this time, James Cameron wanted to be working but didn't have the time to do a whole other film so he took on a writing assignment; this turned out to be Aliens (1986)."", u""Near the beginning of the movie, when Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) receives a message on her answering machine breaking her date, the voice on the machine is James Cameron's. Years later, Hamilton and Cameron got married and subsequently divorced."", u'One afternoon during a break in filming, Arnold Schwarzenegger went into a restaurant in downtown L.A. to get some lunch and realized all too late that he was still in Terminator makeup - with a missing eye, exposed jawbone and burned flesh.', u'O.J.

In 1990 (before Simpson\'s first trial) Dark Horse Comics printed issues using his likeness.', u""The initial draft for the movie was sold to James Cameron's wife, Gale Anne Hurd, for the price of only $1.00."", u'While shooting this film, James Cameron often resorted to what he called ""Guerilla Film Making"" as a way of getting around acquiring permits needed to film certain scenes. This involved the production crew and actors quickly arriving at a specified location, shooting the scene and leaving before the police arrived. As a result, some of the people seen in a few shots are actual everyday citizens completely unaware they\'re in a movie. This was also used for reshoots with Cameron even calling and waking Arnold Schwarzenegger once at 3am to meet him at a location already in full costume to quickly reshoot a scene. This explains why most of the film occurs at night. Cameron also used this tactic to film the very last scene where Sarah drives off into the desert. This almost backfired, however, when the police came sniffing around.', u'Arnold Schwarzenegger tried to avoid Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn as much as possible since the Terminator was trying to kill them, not form connections.', u""Arnold Schwarzenegger's famous debut line, 'I'll be back,' was originally scripted as 'I'll come back.'"", u""James Cameron's original idea was that Skynet would send two Terminators at once: one would be a cyborg, while the other would consist of liquid metal and would be able to shape-shift (the resistance would also have sent two humans, but one was to die during the time travel). Cameron realized early on that this latter effect could not be realized with the special effects at the time, so he abandoned it early on. When a completely computer-generated special effect proved to be a success in Cameron's The Abyss (1989), he revived the idea of the liquid Terminator for the sequel Terminator 2 (1991)."", u""In James Cameron's original treatment, Sarah Connor has an old figure skating injury that was fixed with a couple of surgical pins, and the Terminator cut the legs open of the first two Sarah Connors to find this identifying mark. In the novelization of the story, the pins were instead inserted into her leg after it was broken during her final fight against the Terminator. SkyNet knew Sarah had surgical pins in her leg, but not when or why she got them. The Terminator was therefore looking for a sign of an injury she had not yet sustained."", u'The future terminator who infiltrates the human camp in the dream sequence is played by Franco Columbu, who is a multiple Mr. Olympia title winner like Arnold Schwarzenegger and is a close friend of his.', u'Arnold Schwarzenegger originally wanted to play Kyle Reese.

In this film, Schwarzenegger has only 14 lines."", u""While filming the final shot, a police car arrived. And the scene was being shot without a permit.

The concept of ""Skynet"" could also have been borrowed from an Ellison short story called ""I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream."" The suit was settled out of court and newer prints of the film acknowledge Ellison. Cameron has claimed that this settlement was forced upon him by the producers. He felt that Ellison was an opportunist making invalid claims, and wanted the case to go on trial. However, the studio told him that he would be personally responsible for financial damages in the event he lost the trial. So he had no choice but to accept the settlement, a fact that he has always resented.', u'The relationship between James Cameron and executive producer/Hemdale head John Daly deteriorated during post-production. According to Cameron, Daly and Orion executive Mike Medavoy (who recommended Arnold Schwarzenegger to Cameron) wanted the film to end right after the tanker explosion, removing the climax at the robot factory and epilogue. Orion Pictures, which co-financed the movie, wanted to be known for its quality movies (like Amadeus (1984) and Platoon (1986)), and perceived The Terminator (1984) as little more than a low budget vehicle to make some quick money. Quoting from Cameron: ""Daly said, \'The film has to end right after the tanker explosion.\' I told him straight, \'F**k you! The film isn\'t over yet.\'"" Daly would ultimately back down, a decision that led to the sudden success of the film. However, Orion\'s advertising support for the film was minimal in Cameron\'s eyes. Three weeks after the film was released, Medavoy still ignored Cameron\'s request to beef up the film\'s ad-campaign: ""They told me, when you have a dirty-down action thriller, the film can last in the box-office for about three weeks plus or so. They are treating the film like dog-s**t!"" Hemdale ultimately raised money to fund more advertisements. Reportedly, Schwarzenegger still holds a grudge towards Orion Pictures due to their lack of support.', u""The Terminator is the only character to be listed in the American Film Institute's 100 Heroes and Villains as both a villain (for The Terminator (1984) and a hero (for Terminator 2 (1991)). Al Pacino and Arnold Schwarzenegger are the only two actors to be on the list as playing a villain and a hero, but Pacino played two different characters. 13 other actors and actresses appear twice or more but either all as heroes or all as villains."", u""According to a 2008 interview with Lance Henriksen, James Cameron had no agent and was living in his car when he wrote the script for the film. Cameron had actually fired his agent because he didn't like the story idea Cameron had conceived for The Terminator (1984)."", u""The laser sight on the .45 Longslide was specially built by Laser Products Corporation (now Sure-Fire).

After a talk with Biehn\'s agent, the producers called Biehn back for another audition and he got the part.', u""Mel Gibson turned down the role of the Terminator, simply feeling he wasn't right for the part. After seeing the film, he praised Arnold Schwarzenegger as a much better choice."", u""Paramount was one of the studios that wanted to produce this film, but they stipulated that James Cameron could not direct it. Since this was Cameron's pet project at the time and he wanted to direct the film, he turned down their offer.

The scene involved the Terminator observing an elderly woman getting into a car and as she saw the Terminator she panicked and put it into reverse hitting a trash can then correcting herself put it into drive and sped off. The Terminator then enters the car, puts it into reverse then into drive mimicking the woman's actions. This was cut from a later script."", u'The movie was released in the late 1980s in Poland under the title ""The Electronic Murderer"". The title was changed because there is a Polish word \'terminator\', meaning roughly \'an apprentice\', and so the title was changed to something more catchy and interesting to audience. By the time Terminator 2 (1991) was released, the original movie was widely available on pirate copies under its original title, and because of it in the early 90s in Poland the word \'terminator\' was widely recognized as the character played by Arnold Schwarzenegger instead of its original meaning, so all the sequels had their titles unaltered.', u'The crew made T-shirts saying, ""You can\'t scare me, I work for James Cameron.""', u""During the final chase, as Reese tosses pipe bombs at the Terminator, there is a single white frame spliced in just before some of the explosions, which is a trick employed by editor Mark Goldblatt. Director James Cameron would later use this trick to heighten the visual impact of gunshots in Aliens (1986). The pyrotechnic charges can be seen on the street, each with a pressure-sensitive strip for triggering the explosion when run over by either the Terminator's motorcycle or the heroes' truck."", u'In the film, the name of the night club where the Terminator first targets Sarah was named Tech Noir after a film genre which James Cameron coined himself in describing what category this film falls under after dismissing the notions that it was a mere horror or slasher film. Tech Noir films like Blade Runner (1982) and The Terminator (1984) combine the old style grittiness of noir films with the futuristic elements of a sci-fi thriller. Cameron himself had the club built specifically for the film and had to turn away local club goers who thought Tech Noir was a real night club. The building still exists but is now a jewelry store.', u'James Cameron cited The Road Warrior (1981) as one of his influences behind ""The Terminator"".', u'Arnold Schwarzenegger\'s iconic catchphrase almost became ""I will be back"" because he thought it sounded more machine-like without a contraction; he also felt ""I\'ll"" sounded too feminine. It was the one major disagreement between Schwarzenegger and James Cameron, and all Cameron had to say to that was ""I don\'t tell you how to act, so don\'t tell me how to write"".', u""The Terminator endoskeleton was very heavy and hard for Stan Winston's team to carry. They found out that building a prop robot out of metal is realistic, but not practical."", u'Jennifer Jason Leigh was considered for the role of Sarah Connor, but director James Cameron feared she was too young for the part. She was later recast as Ginger but she was replaced at the last minute with Bess Motta.', u""The scene where the Terminator breaks into a station wagon was the very last thing shot and it was added a few weeks before the film's release. The scene was filmed in 2 hours by James Cameron and Arnold Schwarzenegger alone. Due to insufficient funds, Cameron had to pay for the scene himself, but could not afford a police permit. As such, another set of Arnold's clothes was placed behind the wagon trunk and Cameron told him to change the moment the scene was deemed finished."", u""A hydraulic arm was used when the Terminator punches through the windshield in the alley scene. This was rehearsed several times and since Arnold Schwarzenegger's face was in the shot too, it all had to be choreographed perfectly, since replacing a windshield was too costly and time consuming."", u""The original treatment by James Cameron included the detail that the Terminator needed to eat periodically in order for his human flesh to survive. A scene is included where the Terminator eats a candy bar, wrapper and all. This detail was incorporated into the script for Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003), with the Terminator selecting Arnold Schwarzenegger's favorite Austrian chocolate wafer. When fans learned that a scene had been shot where the Terminator ate chocolate, the reaction was overwhelmingly negative and the scene was omitted."", u""The Terminator's motorcycle was later displayed in Arnold Schwarzenegger's restaurant Planet Hollywood."", u""Sylvester Stallone was considered for The Terminator. Coincidentally, a year after, James Cameron and Stallone wrote Rambo: First Blood Part II (1985) together. Also, there was a competition between Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger's success in action movies about who would win in a battle: Rambo or the Terminator. Stallone later worked with Arnold on the Expendables movies and Escape Plan (2013). In Last Action Hero (1993), a scene features a video store cardboard cut-out of Stallone as the Terminator."", u""There was minimal interference from the film's financial backer, Orion, partly due to the budget offered. However, they suggested two things. The first was a cyborg canine that accompanies Reese - an idea turned down by James Cameron; the second was strengthening the relationship between Kyle and Sarah, which Cameron decided to accept."", u'In the scene where The Terminator attacks Sarah in the police station, the cop states that there are ""Thirty police officers"" in the station. If you count the cops that The Terminator kills on screen and the burst fire that he shoots for off screen kills, it adds up to thirty.', u'The ""fog"" in the scene after Sarah and Reese leave the bridge where they spent the night is actually bug spray, due to the big ""fly scare"" in the filming location at that time. The crew was going to wait until the spray dissipated, but decided to use it as fog for the effect instead. This is revealed in a DVD easter egg, which can be found by pressing the right arrow in the languages section until the square on the right is lit up.', u'Though it is now considered a Sci-fi classic, this film was originally conceived and written as a horror movie. If you strip away the robots and time travel plot, it is very similar to a Slasher picture, and borrows many of the genre\'s tropes. The Terminator is the movie\'s ""Unstoppable Killer,"" who stalks an innocent woman, killing all of her loved ones until he is in turn killed off in a creative way. Sarah Connor is the movie\'s ""Final Girl,"" who is strong enough to outsmart the killer and the only one to make it out alive.     The end of the film also employs many of the Slasher genre\'s techniques and scare tactics. A final showdown in an isolated place where no one can help, crawling through tight, cramped, and dangerous spaces to escape, and the killer comes back for a ""final scare"" multiple times.     That being said, in following these Slasher movie tropes, that makes the Terminator one of the few ""Unstoppable Killers"" of the genre to use firearms as his main weapon, and makes Sarah Connor one of the few ""Final Girls"" of the genre to have sex in the picture and make it out alive.', u'Hand-held cameras were used for much of the action. This helped give ""an energy to the scene that you can\'t get any other way"", said cinematographer Adam Greenberg.', u'The only time in the ""Terminator"" franchise when The Terminator changes his hairstyle in the film. When The Terminator breaks into an apartment in the self-repair sequences, his hairstyle is different to the one he had earlier on in the film.    This is because he runs through a fire caused by a car explosion where his hair is burned. He also loses his eyebrows, and spends the rest of the movie without them.', u'Contrary to popular belief Lance Henriksen was never going to be The Terminator. He helped Writer/director James Cameron pitch the idea to the producers. Cameron did make early sketches showing The Terminator looking like Henriksen.

Director Richard Fleischer agreed with Schwarzenegger, but complied with Universal's wishes to make Conan the Destroyer (1984) more like a comic book. Although it out-grossed Conan the Barbarian (1982), it didn't do as well in the US, because it was more family-friendly, just as Schwarzenegger and Fleischer feared.

The story is that the Mattel Toy Company started to make some Conan action figures, but after viewing the film, the executives realized that they couldn\'t afford to be associated with a film with such graphic sex and violence. They gave their doll blonde hair, called him ""He-man"", and thus created He-Man and the Masters of the Universe (1983). However, since the first He-Man figures were released in 1981, the legend appears to be false. In 1984, however, now-defunct toy company Remco released an officially licensed series of Conan action figures. Ironically enough, once the He-Man action figures became immensely popular, numerous knockoffs were produced, including a repainted He-Man figure that had brown hair, making it look like Arnold Schwarzenegger.

He ""defines his own purpose and shapes his own destiny. Conan does not have a noble destiny; in contrast to much fantasy fiction, he is not of noble birth, he is not fulfilling any prophecy, he is not the ""chosen one"" of any gods or powers that be.

Her only previous role in an English-language film was the exploitation film Guyana: Cult of the Damned (1979)."", u'The painting of symbols on Conan\'s body and the swarm of ghosts during the barbarian\'s resurrection did not derive from Conan tales. They were inspired by the Japanese horror film Kwaidan (1964), a collection of ghost tales. The scenes are primarily based on the film\'s depiction of ""Hoichi the Earless"", a traditional tale abound a blind musician who is asked to entertain ghosts.', u""There were few optical effects used on the film, as John Milius felt that overly depending on depictions of the supernatural would ruin the film. Among the effects used were adding glint and sparkle to The Eye of the Serpent and Valeria's Valkyrie armor, and the depiction of ghosts. Most optical effects were created by Visual Concepts Engineering (VCE), while the ghost scene was a co-operation between the VCE and Industrial Light and Magic."", u'The DVD commentary promises a third movie a few times, but the third movie was shelved entirely.', u""The Cimmerians of the Hyborian Age, Conan's tribe, are named after a historic tribe of that name. They first appear in the historical record c. 714 BC. In that year they assisted Sargon II, King of Assyria (reigned 722 - 705 BC) in his victory against the kingdom of Urartu. In 705 BC, they fought against Sargon himself and killed him in battle. In 696-695 BC, they are recorded as migrating to Anatolia, invading and conquering Phrygia and destroying the capital Gordium. In 679 BC, they invaded Cilicia and Tabal but were defeated by Esarhaddon, King of Assyria (reigned 681-669 BC). In c. 654 BC, they invaded Lydia, killed its king Gyges and damaged the capital Sardis. In the 640s BC, they invaded Lydia again and sacked Sardis. They also raided the Greek cities of Ionia. They were eventually defeated by Alyattes, King of Lydia (reigned 619-560 BC), and they disappear from the historical record. It is thought possible that they migrated to Cappadocia. Several later tribes have been suggested as their descendants due to name similarities, though no evidence seems to confirm it."", u'Robert E. Howard conceived of Cimmeria, Conan\'s homeland, prior to creating the character himself. In February, 1932, Howard wrote the poem Cimmeria, about a ""land of Darkness and deep Night"", a gloomy place with dark woods, dusky silent streams and a leaden cloudy sky.', u'The Temple of Set was built on the mountains to the west of the city of Almeria. Built out of various woods, lacquers, and tons of concrete. Its stairway had 120 steps.', u""The scene with the vultures at the Tree of Woe made use of both real birds and a fake one. The real ones were placed in the branches of the tree, while the one Conan bites was mechanical. The dummy bird's feathers and wings were from a dead vulture, and its control mechanisms were routed inside the false tree."", u""The film's depiction of violence polarized fans and critics in the 1980s. Some felt that the film was too violent and included too many deaths. Others felt that some of the violent scenes were exciting but not all were well-executed.

Howard: ""The Hour of the Dragon"". All other Conan tales were either short stories or poems. Several pastiche writers chose to write novels instead of short stories. By 1982, Conan had appeared in several novels.', u'Valeria as depicted in the film has been described as an Amazon character, a female warrior whose battle prowess matches that of Conan, serves as his equal in behavior and status, and is bound to him by loyalty and love.', u'Sean Connery was considered for the role of Thulsa Doom.', u'The artist most associated with Conan is likely Frank Frazetta whose covers redefined the visual appearance of Conan and influenced many subsequent artists.', u'The brief scene with an older Conan sitting on the throne of Aquilonia was filmed in 1980, prior to most of the other filming. This footage was initially intended to be a trailer but John Milius decided to use it as the opening sequence of the film. Following concerns from the producers, the scene was moved to the end of the film.', u""The scene in which Valeria and Subotai fought off ghosts to save Conan and the final battle with Doom's forces were filmed in the salt marshes of Almerimar. To improve the scenes, certain alterations were performed in the local landscape, such as the construction of Stonehenge-like ruins. This attracted the protests of environmentalists."", u'The use of live animals in the film was controversial. The American Humane Association, the overseeing organization for humane treatment of animals on the sets of Hollywood films, noted that there were incidents such as a dog being kicked, a camel striked, and horses tripped. So animals were in fact harmed.', u'John Milius and Basil Poledouris worked together during the production to determine the themes and ""emotional tones"" for each scene. Milius\' original concept for the film and its music reportedly involved an opera with little or no dialog. Poledouris composed enough musical pieces to cover most of the film.', u""Max von Sydow did this movie for his son, who's a longtime Conan fan."", u'Arnold Schwarzenegger calls the movie ""God\'s gift to [his] career.""', u'While Conan and other barbarian characters were not the only creations of Robert E. Howard, he seemed to prefer them over more ""civilized"" characters. The writer propagated the view that human civilization is unnatural, inherently corrupt, and fragile. One of the Conan tales summarizes his views on the subject: ""Barbarism is the natural state of mankind. Civilization is unnatural. It is a whim of circumstance. And barbarism must always ultimately triumph.""', u'Race and racial traits of both barbarian and civilized tribes and kingdoms played a prominent part in the original Conan tales. They formed the basis of characterization as well. While often considered racist in attitude, Robert E. Howard at times included sympathetic black and Jewish characters in his work. Both were at the time considered undesirable minority groups in the United States.', u'Another of Robert E. Howard\'s personal beliefs that influenced the Conan stories was his placing of supreme value on individuality and individual liberty above the restrains of laws and customs. According to one of his writings on the subject: ""I\'d rather be a naked savage, shivering, starving, freezing, hunted by wild beasts and enemies, but free to go and come, with the range of the earth to roam, than the fattest, richest, most bedecked slave in a golden palace with the crustal fountains, silken divans, and ivory-bosomed dancing girls of Haroun al Raschid.""', u'Robert E. Howard\'s Conan tales are thought influenced by pre-existing philosophies and literary schools: Romanticism, Neo-romanticism, Aestheticism, and the Decadent movement. They influenced such story elements as a disdain for reason, tradition, and any form of tyranny, a love of beauty, color, and pageantry in the descriptions of anything from battlefields to decadent cities, themes of wanderlust, black magic, accursed jewels, and snake figures, and also Conan\'s personal philosophy: ""Let me live deep while I live; let me know the rich juices of red meat and stinging wine on my palate, the hot embrace of white arms, the mad exultation of battle when the blue blades flame and crimson, and I am content... I live, I burn with life, I love, I slay, and am content.""', u'While Conan is chiefly remembered for his strength and fighting skills, the character was not created as dumb muscle. Stories where Conan is cast in a leadership position tend to depict him as a talented commander, tactician, and strategist. His creator also depicted him as having reading and writing skills and a talent for learning languages during his many travels. According to one of his stories: ""In his roaming about the world the giant adventurer had picked up a wide smattering of knowledge, particularly including the speaking and reading of many alien tongues. Many a sheltered scholar would have been astonished at the Cimmerian\'s linguistic abilities.""', u'An important plot point in several of his stories is the contrast between Conan as a barbarian and rogue with the more civilized or sophisticated people of the tales. He tends to appear significantly more honest or honorable than them. For example in ""Rogues in the House"" (1934), Conan is contrasted with two corrupt politicians. One of them admits, ""This Cimmerian is the most honest man of the three of us, because he steals and murders openly."" In ""Shadows in the Moonlight"" (1934), Conan is surprised to learn that a female slave was sold by her own father as punishment for disobeying him. He admits that the Cimmerians are barbarians but ""We do not sell our children"".', u'According to John Milius, his primary influences for the depiction of the Serpent cult and its assassination plans were the Hashshashin (Assassins) and the Thuggee (Thugs).', u""The final battle against Thulsa Doom's men was inspired by Seven Samurai (1954)."", u'The first series character by Robert E. Howard was Kull the Conqueror, created in 1929. Howard wrote 12 short stories about Kull and one poem. However, he only managed to sell three of them to his publisher. Conan was conceived as a replacement character. The Kull story ""By This Axe I Rule!"" was re-worked into ""The Phoenix on the Sword"", the first appearance of Conan.', u'Robert E. Howard envisioned the Cimmerians (and Conan) as proto-Celts. The name Conan is also Celtic and appears in both history and legend. The Celt Conan Meriadoc supposedly founded Brittany in the late 4th or early 5th century. His tale appeared frequently in Medieval Sources and several later Dukes of Brittany bore his name.', u'The characterization of the civilized kingdoms of the Hyborian Age was influenced by creator Robert E. Howard\'s own views on progress and civilization. They are wealthy and developed, but frequently lawless and mostly corrupt. His personal view of history includes ""a repeating pattern of civilizations reaching their peak, becoming decadent, decaying and then being conquered by another people."" The setting of his work tends to be in either the period of decline of an entire civilization or in the ruins it left behind following its demise.', u'Those supporting a connection between the Conan franchise and the Masters of the Universe point to the similarities between Thulsa Doom and Skeletor. Thulsa Doom as described by creator Robert E. Howard has a skull-face and his depictions in art tend to have his head as only a human skull. Skeletor, archenemy of He-Man was depicted in the 1980s as ""a muscular blue humanoid with a purple hood over his yellowing bare-bone skull"". Both characters were also powerful sorcerers.', u""The script by Oliver Stone included the raid on the Cimmerian village. It was one of the few elements of that script which John Milius chose to keep, expand, and to provide follow up to. He followed the scene with with the barbarian's enslavement at the Wheel of Pain and training as a gladiator."", u""Martial arts training and sword training for Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sandahl Bergman, and Gerry Lopez was performed by expert Kiyoshi Yamazaki. He also assisted in the choreography of the sword fights. Yamazaki had a cameo in the film as one of Conan's instructors."", u""While expensive to create, the primary swords created for the film proved heavy, unbalanced, and unsuitable for actual combat. They were mostly used in close-up shots. For the fight scenes, they used lighter versions made of aluminum, fiberglass, and steel. The other weapons used in the film were not as elaborate; Valeria's talwar was ground out from an aluminum sheet."", u'The talwar sword used by Valeria, a curved sword or sabre, was not a typical choice for American films. It is a sword design from the Indian subcontinent and primarily associated with the Mughal Empire. The design is thought to have influenced the Pattern 1796 light cavalry sabre used by the British during the Napoleonic Wars.', u""In an attempt to minimise injuries, certain fight scenes and depictions of killing blows made use of trick swords. They were made out of fibreglass, had retractable blades and some of them sprayed blood from their tips. Accidents still happened in scenes involving them, however. In one scene an extra used a trick sword to slice open Sandahl Bergman's finger."", u'Thulsa Doom\'s onscreen transformation into a giant snake was one of the most elaborate special effects in the film. It involved ""fake body parts, live and dummy snakes, miniatures, and other camera tricks combined into a flowing sequence with lap dissolve. After James Earl Jones was filmed in position, he was replaced by a hollow framework with a rubber mask that was pushed from behind by a snake head-shaped puppet to give the illusion of Doom\'s facial bones changing. The head was then replaced with a 6 feet (1.8 m) mechanical snake; as it moved outwards, a crew member pressed a foot pedal to collapse the framework. For the final part of the sequence, a real snake was filmed on a miniature set.""', u'John Milius initially wanted to have Thulsa Doom\'s introductory scene use either parts of the cantata ""Carmina Burana"" (1937) by Carl Orff (1895-1982), or music patterned after it. He changed his mind when he learned that ""Carmina Burana"" had already been used for the music score of Excalibur (1981).', u'Basil Poledouris\' music theme for Thulsa Doom included energetic choral passages, sung in the Latin language. The lyrics were composed in English and where then roughly translated. The Latin words where chosen primarily for the way they sounded, and do not always make sense. The melody of the theme was based on ""Dies Irae"" (Day of Wrath), a Latin hymn of the 13th century whose authorship is disputed. The hymn is known both for being part of the Requiem Mass of the Roman Catholic Church and being frequently quoted by composers.', u'The film connections with opera are not limited to dialogue and and costumes. The opening sequence involves a sword forging scene, the hero witnesses his parents\' deaths, grows up as a slave, and slays a giant serpent-dragon. These are all in common with the story of the protagonist in the opera Siegfried (1876) by Richard Wagner, the third part of ""Der Ring des Nibelungen (The Ring of the Nibelung)"". The opera was in turn based on the character Sigurd/Siegfried in Norse mythology, the slayer of Fafnir the dragon.', u'The brief use of the writings of Friedrich Nietzsche (1844-1900) in the film has led certain scholars and reviewers to claim that the tale borrows from his concept of the ""\xdcbermensch"" (Superman, Superhuman), introduced in ""Thus Spoke Zarathustra"" (1883-1891).', u'Arnold Schwarzenegger kept the snake dagger as a memento. He still has it.', u'Stunt coordinator Terry Leonard broke his leg doing a fall. According to Arnold Schwarzenegger, Leonard was trying to impress Sandahl Bergman. Sure enough, they started dating afterward.', u'Arnold Schwarzenegger asked Sandahl Bergman to be careful jumping on him. ""I\'m very exposed here!"" he said.', u'The snake trainer\'s assistants were all beautiful girls, which made John Milius say, ""He was sort of like Thulsa Doom.""', u'Conan the Cimmerian is actually the second character by Robert E. Howard to use that name. Already in 1931, Howard used the name ""Conan"" for a Gael reaver in an unrelated story. The earlier Conan also swore by the name of Crom.', u'While Conan was a womanizing character with many lovers, his creator Robert E. Howard actually had little experience with romance. His only known girlfriend was fellow writer Novalyne Price Ellis. Their relationship was the basis of the film ""The Whole Wide World"" (1996).', u'Another influence on Robert E. Howard were the writings and theories of Helena Blavatsky and William Scott-Elliot on ""lost civilizations, ancient wisdom, races, magic and sunken continents and the lands of Lemuria, Atlantis and Hyperborea"" which are present in either the Kull or the Conan stories.', u'Stygia and its culture in the Hyborian Age are a fantasy counterpart to Ancient Egypt, with deities and names based on ancient Egypt. The chief deity Set himself is based on two deities of Egyptian mythology. The name is based on the god Set/Seth, chiefly associated with the desert, storms, disorder, violence and foreigners. He had an animal form but not associated with any particular animal, though late depictions portray him with a donkey head. The giant serpent form of Hyborian Set is instead based on Apep/Apophis, a serpent god representing Chaos and ""personification of all that was evil"". Though Seth and Apep were originally depicted as enemies in Egyptian legend they were later identified with each other, probably influencing their conflation by Howard. The Ancient Greeks identified the evil Seth with Typhon, an enemy of their gods. Similar counterparts of Set/Seth and archenemies of the gods appear in several ancient mythologies and there are theories that they legends could have common origins.', u""Aquilonia in the Conan tales is depicted as the most powerful of the Hyborian kingdoms, kingdoms created by the Hyborian tribes. It is also among the most powerful kingdoms in the entire series, alongside the eastern empires of Turan and Vendhya. According to Howard's essay on the Hyborian Age, the Aquilonians following the death of Conan would create their own expansionist empire. They would eventually be conquered themselves by the barbarian empire of the Picts."", u""While named after Thulsa Doom, the film character has many similarities with an actual Conan enemy: Thoth-Amon, a Stygian sorcerer and priest of Set. He first appeared alongside Conan in his first appearance. They never met in person in the Robert E. Howard stories, but Thoth-Amon's plots ended up involving Conan."", u'Thulsa Doom has no proper origin story in any of his incarnations in the media. Despite his association with the realms of Atlantis and Valusia in the Kull the Conqueror tales, he briefly claims to have experienced his first death before Atlantis first rose from the sea.', u'Among the missing elements in the Conan origin presented in the film is teenaged Conan\'s first battle: the Battle of Venarium. According to the printed works on Conan, Venarium was an Aquilonian frontier fort built in Cimmerian territory. It was an attempt by civilized Aquilonia to colonize Cimmeria. The Cimmerian clans united to attack it, with a 15-year-old Conan among them. In summary: ""Conan joined the howling, blood-mad horde that swept out of the northern hills, stormed over the stockade walls, and drove the Aquilonians back across their frontier.""', u'The city of Arenjun in Zamora, the ""City of Thieves"", and Conan\'s career as a professional thief are based on the short story ""The Tower of the Elephant"" (1933) by Robert E. Howard. This story features Conan\'s chronologically earliest adventure in a civilized kingdom. Arenjun has proved a popular setting for pastiche works and adaptations. The idea of Conan as a thief did not sell well in Howard\'s time, but has been revisited by many later writers. The other prominent city of Zamora, Shadizar, has also featured prominently in stories by other writers.', u'In his introduction of Conan, creator Robert E. Howard described him as ""black-haired, sullen-eyed, sword in hand, a thief, a reaver, a slayer, with gigantic melancholies and gigantic mirth"".', u""The many roles of Conan in the film (slave, pit fighter, thief, mercenary) are consistent with his depiction in any media. Robert E. Howard portrayed the character as a wandering adventure whose profession, level of wealth, and other circumstances largely depended on a story's specific location and its overall placement in Conan's personal timeline. Stories variously featured him as a thief, an outlaw, a mercenary, a pirate, a tribal chieftain, a general, and a king. Other writers have followed this example and portrayed him in these and any other line of work, according to their preferences. This allows the franchise to include elements spanning several genres, from war stories and pirate tales to political fiction and crime fiction."", u'The morality of Conan in any media tends to vary widely. Depending on the story, his motivation includes self-preservation, personal gain, revenge, and protectiveness towards specific people or entire groups. He regularly performs heroic deeds but his causes are not always noble or selfless. He can be seen as antihero who simply tends to face opponents more villainous in nature than himself.', u'Among the deviations of the film from the literary depiction of Conan was that this Conan was ""less powerful, less talkative, and less educated"".', u""CASTLE THUNDER: Heard during the scene when the spirits try to take Conan's body away."", u'Conan is a Cimmerian. In the essay ""The Hyborian Age"", which fleshed out Conan\'s world and established its history, Robert E. Howard established his Cimmerians as descendants of the Atlanteans and ancestors of the Gaels. He specified that the Gaels descended from ""pure-blooded Cimmerian clans"" and were themselves ancestors of the Irish people and the Highland Scots. This was partly based on Howard\'s own fascination with the historical Celts.', u'While Robert E. Howard remains the best known Conan writer, he only wrote Conan stories from 1932 to 1936. He then committed suicide, leaving behind several unfinished story drafts. Several of these were completed by other authors and all Conan material following the 1930s has been written by other writers. Among the better known ones are L. Sprague de Camp and Lin Carter.', u'Arnold Schwarzenegger was reportedly chosen for the role of Conan after the producers viewed a rough cut of his bodybuilding film Pumping Iron (1977).', u'When filming started, James Earl Jones had to co-ordinate his schedule with the film crew. At the time he was also starring in ""Lesson to Aloes"", a Broadway play.', u'James Earl Jones provided Arnold Schwarzenegger with pointers on how to deliver his lines.', u'The Princess was played by Val\xe9rie Quennessen, a French actress with relatively few previous roles. Her debut in American cinema was in the film Rankat kielikurssit (1979).', u'The scene with Conan on the throne of Aquilonia was filmed in the Shepperton Studios facility in Shepperton, Surrey, England. The facility has formed the primary filming locations of various famous films such as The Omen (1976), The Boys from Brazil (1978), Alien (1979), and The Elephant Man (1980).', u'The principal photography was supposed to take place in Yugoslavia. but the Yugoslavian film industry proved ill-equipped for large-scale film production. There were also concerns over the stability of the country following the death of President Josip Broz Tito (1892-1980). The producers elected to move the project to Spain, which was cheaper and where resources were more easily available. However, the relocation from Yugoslavia to Spain delayed filming for several months. Ironically, there was a coup in Spain while they were there.', u""The interior sets for the Tower of Serpents and Thulsa Doom's temple were located in a large warehouse, 20 miles (32 km) outside Madrid. Additional sets for the Tower of Serpents were constructed in an abandoned hangar of the Torrej\xf3n Air Base, a Spanish Air Force base in the vicinity of Madrid."", u'The Cimmerian village was built in a forest near the Valsa\xedn ski resort, south of Segovia. To simulate snow in the village, the crew used marble shavings scattered on the ground.', u'While several large sets were built for the film, their number had to be limited due to budget constrains. John Milius did not want to rely on optical effects and matte paintings (painted landscapes) to film the remaining scenes. The crew instead adopted miniature effect techniques (playing on perspective) to achieve the illusion of size and grandeur for several scenes. Scale models of structures were constructed by special effects and visual effects artist Emilio Ruiz del R\xedo and positioned in front of the cameras so that they appeared as full-sized structures on film.', u'Film designer Ron Cobb had to decide about how the Hyborian Age buildings and structures should look like, having no precedent on what to work on. He though that they should try ""to invent [their] own fantasy history"", and yet maintain a ""realistic, historical look"". He decided to avoid Greco-Roman imagery to avoid association with the Italian ""sword-and-sandal""/""Peplum film genre"" of the late 1950s and 1960s which had fallen out of fashion. He instead took inspiration from Dark Age Europe, the Vikings, and the Mongols.', u'Stunt co-ordinator Terry Leonard had recently worked on Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981). He helped Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sandahl Bergman, and Gerry Lopez perform their stunts and the fight scenes. According to Leonard, the trio performed the scenes without needing stuntmen as replacements.', u""Executives insisted for certain violent scenes to be removed prior to the film's release. Among them were close-up shots on the decapitated head of Conan's mother, Subotai's slaying of a monster at the top of the Tower of Serpents, and Conan chopping off a pickpocket's arm in a bazaar."", u'A few critics of the 1980s expected that any film based on pulp stories, comic books, or both to be inherently light-hearted or corny. They were both surprised and dismayed by the use of Nietzschean themes and ideology.', u'While the film was only a modest box office hit, it was still among the most commercially successful comic book and pulp adaptations of the 1980s.', u""Gilbert Taylor was the film's original cinematographer and was replaced after the dailies of the first interior footage that they shot looked too dark. Taylor had been working with very low light levels and being sure his exposures were all right, asked to send the negative to a UK lab to get developed. But when the dailies still came severely underexposed, they found out that there was a problem with the stop markings on the lenses, which weren't accurate and didn't reflect the actual transmission of light through the lens to the film stock. Since the first assistant cameraman of the show was Peter Taylor, Gilbert's son, the production fired him as they felt he should have checked the lenses prior to the shoot. When his son was fired, Taylor left the picture and was replaced by TV cameraman Duke Callaghan, who had shot Jeremiah Johnson (1972), scripted by John Milius. The final cut of the picture only feature a few scenes which were shot by Taylor, such as the opening scenes with the village being attacked, Conan trying to escape from the wolves (a scene which has been timed day-for-day for the Blu-ray, but looked like day-for-night in previous transfers) and the scene with Conan and the witch. When Callaghan took over the film, the crew performed precise lens test to hand mark the actual and real transmission stop on each lens, and thus the underexposure risk due to faulty markings was gone."", u'John Milius devised the tactics and booby traps. They built a miniature model set for a dry run before shooting.', u'The Conan series is considered a pioneering one of the ""sword and sorcery"" genre. Although the genre properly started in the 1930s, it was only named in 1961. The term was coined by writer Fritz Leiber.', u'Robert E. Howard, creator of Conan, was proud of his Irish heritage and deeply fascinated with the Celts. As a result Conan and several other protagonists by his pen were proto-Celts, Celts, or Irish themselves. This tends to be contrasted with the anti-Irish sentiment still prevalent in the 1930s.', u'The defining style of the original Conan stories was a combination of a ""hardboiled, dark and realistic"" tone with more fantastic elements. According to a description of the effect on the genre of fantasy: ""Howard did for fantasy fiction what Dashiell Hammett did for crime fiction.""', u'Insight into the thought processes of Robert E. Howard is provided by his correspondence with fellow writer H.P. Lovecraft. He is also considered influenced by Lovecraft and his writings, including the Cthulhu Mythos. According to an early reviewer of Howard, ""Howard used a good deal of the Lovecraft cosmogony and demonology"" and Conan ""had recourse to magic and the aid of Lovecraft\'s Elder Gods.""', u'The role of Thulsa Doom as a cult leader in the film seems influenced by real-life cult leaders who had a presence in the news. The most prominent of them were probably Charles Manson (1934-) of the Manson Family and Jim Jones (1931-1978) of the Peoples Temple. The perceived negative role of cults in society gave rise to an anti-cult movement that was prominent in the 1980s.', u'While Conan did not suffer slavery in the original Conan tales, he did experience it in pastiche works. In the short story ""Legions of the Dead"" (1978) by L. Sprague de Camp and Lin Carter, a teenaged Conan joins the Aesir in conflict with the Hyperboreans. He is captured by the enemy and enslaved.', u'The film contains scenes where Conan is chased by wolves, discovers of a crypt, and within it a sword and a mummy. These are all taken from the short story ""The Thing in the Crypt"" (1967) by L. Sprague de Camp and Lin Carter. Missing is the key scene from the short story, the mummy rising and fighting Conan.', u'Despite a long career in short stories, novels, and comic books, the circumstances of Conan\'s last years and death have yet to be recorded. The only major attempt at a finale to the series remains the novel ""Conan of the Isles"" (1968) by L. Sprague de Camp and Lin Carter. In the novel, Conan is in his 60s and abdicates the throne of Aquilonia to go on one final quest. He sails to the Western Ocean and has an adventure in Antillia, a chain of islands in the western part of the Western ocean (Hyborian Atlantic Ocean). He survives the tale and sails further west, into uncharted territories. Robert E. Howard wrote in his 1930s notes about Conan\'s life that Conan would have further adventures following the end of his reign, to Khitai (Hyborian China), Hyrkania and areas to less known areas beyond them. He also noted that Conan also visited ""a nameless continent in the western hemisphere, and roamed among the islands adjacent to it."", indicating that Conan visited the Americas during the Hyborian Age. However, he died before writing any tale recording these adventures. Events in Aquilonia following Conan\'s abdication, set during the reign of Conan II (Conan\'s son, formerly known as Prince Conn), are recorded in the frame story of the novel ""Conan at the Demon\'s Gate"" (1994) by Roland J. Green. However there is no new information about Conan himself. The thought of Conan as his death approaches are recorded in the narrative poem ""Death-Song of Conan the Cimmerian"" (1972) by Lin Carter, but the poem offers no indication of the time and location of the event.', u'In the film and its novelization, the raiders who enslave a child Conan are Vanir. The Vanir are creations of Robert E. Howard, living in Vanaheim, one of the far north realms of the Hyborian Age. The tribe and their neighbors (and rivals) the Aesir of Asgard are fantasy counterparts of Dark-Age and Viking Age Scandinavia. Their names derive from surviving records of Norse mythology. The Aesir and Vanir were two related (and rival) groups of gods. The Aesir were the principle pantheon and included prominent deities such as Odin, Frigg, Thor, Baldr/Balder, and Tyr. Vanir were a lesser pantheon including such gods as Njord, Frey/Freyr, and Freyja. Asgard was the realm of the Aesir in Norse mythology, while Vanaheim/Vanaheimr was the realm of the Vanir. The earliest prominent attestation for both of them were the works of writer and historian Snorri Sturluson (1179-1241), and there are theories that he coined the terms himself.', u'Hyrkania and Hyrkanian characters figure in the scenes depicting Conan\'s career as a pit fighter. In literature and comic books, Hyrkania appears as one of the eastern realms of the Hyborian Age. The most prominent Hyrkanian character is Red Sonja. The realm serves as a fantasy counterpart to both Mongolia and the ancient satrapy of Hyrcania, in the southern coast of the Caspian Sea. Hyrcania means ""Wolf-land"" in Old Persian. The area became proverbial for its fauna and references appear in several literary works by authors such as Virgil, Miguel de Cervantes and William Shakespeare.', u'The phrase ""Between the years when the oceans drank Atlantis and the gleaming cities, and the years of the rise of the Sons of Aryas"" derives directly from the introduction of the Phoenix ""The Phoenix on the Sword"" (1932), the first Conan story. The story set the Hyborian Age, which it introduced, between the sinking of Atlantis and the emergence of the Aryans (Indo-Europeans). The term Sons of Aryas can be considered an allusion to the then-contemporary concept that the Aryans formed an ""Aryan race"". The term derives from an ancient Indo-Iranian term for ""noble"" and was popularized in Europe by 18th and 19th century linguists. It was popularized in the United States by the best-selling book ""Race Life of the Aryan Peoples"" (1907) by Joseph Widney (1841-1938). which featured the Aryans as an empire-building race. His concept included every Indo-European speaking Empire from the ancient Hittite Empire to the so-called American Empire. The term has largely fallen out of fashion with scholars due to its associations with scientific racism and Nazism.', u'The description of Conan in literature and artistic renditions can vary widely. His blue eyes and black hair are frequently described by his creator and sequels and adaptations tend to maintain these elements. His hair is almost always described as long or forming a mane, but the ""square-cut mane"" described in the original tales has been inconsistently used. Howard once mentioned Conan having a hairy chest, but this is again inconsistently used. The clothing of the character in Howard\'s tales tended to change according to the setting, featured culture and weather conditions of a story. Later depictions tend to have Conan dressed in a loincloth or other minimal clothing, to fit the modern concept of a barbarian. A light chain shirt and a horned helmet are also popularly used for Conan depictions, particularly those set in his younger years. While Howard regularly described Conan as tall or even a giant, he never gave specifics about his height or weight in adult life. His only description of a 15-year-old Conan mentioned him as standing 6 feet tall (1.8 m) and weighing 180 pounds (82 kg), but with the indication that he was not fully grown. No human is ever described as stronger than Conan, though several are described as taller than him. He is described and depicted as muscular, but not so far as to limit his agility. His skin color is described as bronze, due to constant exposure to the sun. One of Howard\'s descriptions of a middle-aged King Conan mentions his scarred face, but facial or other scars are rarely used in his portrayals.', u'Subotai is not based on any Conan character. He is named after and loosely based on a historical figure: Subutai (c. 1175-1248), a general of the Mongol Empire. He was a close companion and primary military strategist of Genghis Khan.', u""Arnold Schwarzenegger's contract restricted him from starring in other sword and sorcery films."", u'The seductive witch was played by Cassandra Gava who was previously known for television roles. Her most notable one was a recurring role in Trapper John, M.D. (1979).', u'The snake cult\'s orgy includes the depiction of a ""half-naked slave girl chained to a pillar, with a snarling leopard at her feet"". Though not appearing in any Conan story, the scene is lifted from a Frank Frazetta painting about the Hyborian Age.', u""The film made use of human dummies and fake body parts to inflate crowd numbers, depict dead bodies, and mutilated body parts. The two prominent decapitation scenes of the film also used fake heads. In the scene where Thulsa Doom decapitates Conan's mother, the actress was protected by the sword by a Plexiglas shield. An artificial head was dropped into the camera's view and another, more elaborate one was used for the close-up shots. In the scene where Conan decapitates Thulsa Doom, Arnold Schwarzenegger hacked at a dummy and pulled a concealed chain to detach its head."", u""Despite his use and perceived overuse of the damsel in distress trope in the Conan stories, Robert E. Howard held feminist views. He was interested in the achievements and capabilities of women. This seems to have influenced his creation of a number of strong female characters, such as Conan's love interests Belit and Valeria."", u""Charles Bronson, Sylvester Stallone, and William Smith were considered for the lead role. Smith was cast as Conan's father."", u'Conan was created by writer Robert E. Howard in 1932. His stories were published in the magazine ""Weird Tales"" (1923-1954), which specialized in fantasy and horror stories.', u'Aquilonia seems to be based on both the Roman Empire and the Carolingian Empire, both among the superpowers of their respective time. It seems to be named after the ancient city of Aquilonia, among the main cities of the Samnites in Italy. Its modern counterpart is the city of Agnone. There have been other cities of the same name in modern Italy, Croatia, and France. Aquilo is another name for the ancient deity Boreas, a personification of the north wing. Some writers have suggested that Howard also chose the name for its similarity to Aquitaine, a territory in France which figured prominently in Medieval history.', u'While all of the Hyborian Age\'s countries and kingdoms are named after historical and mythological realms and people, Robert E. Howard\'s rendition of Hyperborea (""beyond the North Wind"") is influenced by the Hyperborean cycle of Clark Ashton Smith (1893-1961).', u'Robert E. Howard feared ageing and old age, which possibly influenced his decision to die young. Conan supposedly lived to his own old age, but most Conan stories have him young and virile. Few Conan stories feature him in his middle age and fewer in his 60s.', u'While several of the cast and crew of the film experienced a career boom following its release, only Arnold Schwarzenegger, Oliver Stone and Basil Poledouris went on to create further successful projects. James Earl Jones was already a successful stage and screen actor.', u'Among the directors considered for the film were Oliver Stone himself and Joe Alves.', u'The first draft of a script for a Conan film was written by Edward Summer and comic book writer Roy Thomas in 1976. It involved Conan being employed by a ""dodgy priest to kill an evil wizard"", and would be partly based on the short story ""Rogues in the House"" (1934). The script was abandoned early. Thomas was chosen for helping with the script because he had written hundreds of Conan stories for Marvel Comics.', u'Oliver Stone\'s script about a Conan tale set in a post-apocalyptic future involved Conan leading an army in a massive battle against a horde of 10,000 mutants. It would incorporate elements from Conan\'s battles in the short stories ""Black Colossus"" (1933) and ""A Witch Shall be Born"" (1934).', u'Most outdoor scenes were shot in the province of Almer\xeda, which offered a semi-arid climate, diverse terrain (deserts, beaches, mountains), and Roman and Moorish structures that could be adapted for many settings.', u'Scenes of a bazaar were filmed at Alcazaba of Almer\xeda, a fortified complex in Almeria. It was constructed by the Caliphate of C\xf3rdoba during the Middle Ages. The Alcazaba has also been used in the filming of such films as Never Say Never Again (1983) and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989).', u'The designs of the Tree of Woe and the costumes have been seen as being influenced by epic opera settings and costumes, in particular the popular ""Der Ring des Nibelungen"" (The Ring of the Nibelung, 1876) by Richard Wagner (1813-1883). These operas were in turn loose adaptations of the Norse sagas and the epic poem ""Nibelungenlied"" (The Song of the Nibelungs, 13th century) which depict Dark Age Europe.', u'Several action scenes in Conan were filmed with a ""mini-jib"", a remote-controlled electronic camera mounted on a motorized lightweight crane. The device was created by special effects supervisor Nick Allder. It was first used in the filming of fantasy film Dragonslayer (1981).', u'Jody Samson, the swordsmith of the film, also created swords, knives, and daggers for such films as First Knight (1995) and The Mask of Zorro (1998).', u""The scene involving a fight and decapitation of a giant snake in the Tower of Serpents made use of three mechanical snakes. They were 36 feet (11 m) long, the snakes' body had a diameter of 2.5 feet (0.76 m), and their heads were 2.5 feet (0.76 m) long and 2 feet (0.61 m) wide."", u'The first version of the ghosts from the ghost scene was rejected by the producers for its perceived similarity to a scene from Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981). Visual Concepts Engineering (VCE) created another version using cel animation and related techniques. This one was accepted.', u'Following the end of filming, John Milius sent Basil Poledouris a tape with scenes set to the music of Richard Wagner, Igor Stravinsky, and Sergei Prokofiev. He wanted to illustrate which emotional overtones matched each scene.', u'Jackie Chan was originally pursued for a role.', u""There were no architectural plans for Thulsa Doom's mountain fortress. The set designer looked at some drawings and just built it on the spot."", u""It didn't snow leading up filming, so the crew started putting powder on the ground and then it snowed."", u""Arnold Schwarzenegger had trouble riding the camel. It kept walking him into the hut's wooden beams."", u'In the original screenplay, the skeleton of the Atlantean General comes alive and fights Conan when Conan takes his sword.', u'Writer Michael Moorcock believes that Conan was influenced by previous characters. He suggested two literary ancestors of Conan: Natty Bumppo by James Fenimore Cooper (1789-1851) and Tarzan by Edgar Rice Burroughs (1875-1950).', u'Thulsa Doom precedes Conan as a literary character. He first appeared in the short story ""The Cat and the Skull"" (written 1928, published 1967). His face there is described ""like a bare white skull, in whose eye sockets flamed livid fire."" He is seemingly invulnerable. His first published appearance, under the alias Kathulos, was in the story ""Skull-Face"" (1929). There he is depicted as an Atlantean necromancer still alive in modern times. He is planning world conquest from 1920s London.', u""Despite his relatively brief use by creator Robert E. Howard in adaptations and comic books, Thulsa Doom is featured as the archenemy of Kull. Since the character is depicted as immortal in the comic books, he appeared as still alive in Conan's time. Conan lives thousands of years following the death of Kull."", u""'Robert E. Howard' (qVv) based much of his original characterization of Thulsa Doom/Kathulos on the popular literary villain Fu Manchu by Sax Rohmer. Like Fu Manchu, his base of operations is London, and he heads a vast conspiracy of Asians, Africans, and Semites against the Western civilization. He is served by an Asian woman who falls in love with the hero of the story, much as Fu Manchu's female associates served as love interests to his enemies."", u'The original Conan stories by Robert E. Howard featured few recurring characters and no long-term foes. The exception was Toth-Amon who was a threat to Conan, but never met him in person. As a result, Conan never had an archenemy. This changed when pastiche writers and comic book writers decided to cast Toth-Amon. The film instead chooses to promote Thulsa Doom in this role.', u""Thulsa Doom demonstrates his absolute control over his followers by having one of them voluntarily jump off a high ledge to her death. This was likely based on a story about Hassan-i Sabbah (c. 1050-1124), master of the Hashshashin (Assassins). He reportedly had one of his followers leap to his death to demonstrate his power to visiting dignitaries. The cult of Thulsa Doom posing a threat to the powerful rulers of the Hyborian Kingdoms and killing may also be loosely based on the actions which coined the Assassins' reputation in the Middle Ages."", u""The film's story has a blacksmith as father of Conan. This is based on the works of L. Sprague de Camp in fleshing out the background of Conan."", u'The film is listed as one of a wave of Hollywood films depicting ""heroic adventures in supernatural lands of fables"", following the success of Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977).', u'The Italian ""sword-and-sandal""/""Peplum film genre"" bears some similarity with the sword-and-sorcery, mixing history and fantasy elements. It featured film series about heroic strongmen such as Maciste, Hercules, Ursus, Samson, and Goliath. The films were very popular from 1958 to 1965, but then went out to fashion. The release of Conan in 1982 and the apparent popularity of sword and sorcery directly led to an Italian revival of the Peplum genre in the 1980s. Films such as Ator, the Fighting Eagle (1982) were directly influenced by Conan.', u'The Riddle of Steel prevalent in the film seems to be resolved by the answer that strength lies not in steel swords. While the weapons are initially hinted to have powers of their own, they are later revealed to be mostly useless and dependent on the strength of their wielders. Thulsa Doom , who sought the answer to the Riddle, comes to the conclusion that the power of flesh is stronger than steel.', u'Some critics believe that the perceived fascist and individualist themes of the film are not contradictory. Instead they are connected.', u'Conan was the most commercially successful created by Robert E. Howard. Several series characters by Howard never appeared in more than two published stories during his lifetime. Conan appeared in 18 published stories by the time Howard died.', u'Reviewer Hoffman Reynolds Hays pointed out the similarities between Conan and Superman, both creations of the 1930s. Both characters were ""wish-projections"" of their creators, both were omnipotent heroes that faced and conquered evil.', u'The copyright status of the original Conan stories and the character himself is disputed in the 21st century. The copyright of the stories was apparently not renewed when originally needed (in the late 1950s and early 1960s) and those stories published in the 1930s may now be in the public domain. Meanwhile, the rights to the Howard estate and the associated characters passed through a variety of owners. More recently they have been acquired by Paradox Entertainment. Paradox was then itself acquired by Cabinet Entertainment which is trying to ascertain its rights over all properties associated with Conan, Kull, Solomon Kane and the other characters created by Howard.', u'The original script by Oliver Stone included the scene where Conan was crucified and this was one of the few elements retained from it. The scene derives from one of the original Conan short stories: ""A Witch Shall be Born"" (1934). Summarized: ""the mighty Cimmerian, hanging on a cross, nails driven through his hands and feet, tearing out the throat of a vulture which comes to peck out his eyes."" The scene is considered one of the most memorable ones in the entire series. The main villain of the story, Queen Taramis/Salome, was not used for the film but was apparently the inspiration for the villain of the same name in Conan the Destroyer (1984).', u'The scene of the film with with Conan and his fellow thieves scaling a tower, battling a giant snake, and stealing a jewel seems to be derived by another of the original Conan stories: ""The Tower of the Elephant"" (1933) set in Zamora. It is among the most famous of the Conan stories. However, none of the characters of the story beside Conan were used in the film.', u'The kingdom of Zamora is not original to the film. It is one of the countries of the Hyborian Age created by Robert E. Howard and serves as the setting of several stories. Howard likely named it after the city of Zamora in Spain. The culture of Zamora as depicted in the stories has elements from the historical Romani (Gypsy) culture.', u""The film twice mentions that Conan will eventually become king of Aquilonia. Conan's first appearance in 1932 actually has Conan on the throne and a few stories by both Robert E. Howard and others have depicted Conan as a middle-aged king. This element has yet to make it into film and television adaptations."", u'The literary and comic book incarnations of Thulsa Doom bear strong resemblance to the fantasy concept of the lich: skull-faced, skeletal, and undead necromancers. The term was popularized by the Dungeons & Dragons franchise and has since appeared in several media. Gary Gygax (1938-2008), co-creator of the original Dungeons & Dragons game, pointed that he based his description of the lich on an undead and immortal character from the short story ""The Sword of the Sorcerer"" (1969) by Gardner Fox (1911-1986). The character is named Afgorkon, has a skull-face and a skeletal form, is a powerful sorcerer, is said to be at least 50,000-years-old, and faces a barbarian hero with similarities to the Howard characters. The term lich for the undead long precedes the modern concept, however, it has been traced back to the short story ""The Death of Halpin Frayser"" (1891) by Ambrose Bierce (1842-c. 1914).', u'Conan\'s encounter with the witch and Subotai was shot among the Ciudad Encantada rock formations in the province of Cuenca. Due to their distinctive shapes, the rock formations have been used in the filming of various films such as spaghetti western ""The Mercenary""/""A Professional Gun"" (1968) and the dinosaur-themed film ""The Valley of Gwangi"" (1969). Cuenca is part of the historic La Mancha region, famously the setting of the two-volume novel ""The Ingenious Gentleman Don Quixote of La Mancha"" (1605, 1615) by Miguel de Cervantes (1547-1616).', u'While Valeria is considered a strong female character, not everyone agrees. Critics of the film see her as either ""a traditional male warrior buddy in a sexy female body"", eye candy, and overly sexualized. They point to the film\'s promotional artwork as presenting Conan as the dominant, sword-wielding hero, and Valeria as a squatting woman in a leather body-suit. Some have even claimed that the film is part of a backlash against feminism in the 1980s and a celebration of masculinity.', u'The role of Conan as a child was played by Jorge Sanz, who was at the time a prolific child actor in Spain. He was went on to a career as a professional actor in adult life.', u'The set of the city of Shadizar was constructed in the Almer\xedan desert. The crew refurbished the fort left behind from the filming of western El Condor (1970).', u'While individualism has been a theme of the Conan franchise since the 1930s, its inclusion in the film has been considered as a product of the 1980s. The theme of individualism is strongly associated with the speeches and policies of President Ronald Reagan. Other associations with Reaganism have been claimed. For example, film writer Dr. Dave Saunders views the film as one where Conan stands for the American hero and Thulsa Doom stands for the evil oppressors, the Soviet Union. Academics Douglas Kellner and Michael Ryan view the film as one Conan stands for the American individual and Thulsa Doom stands for an overly domineering federal government.', u'John Huston was considered for the role of King Osric.', u'In Spain was a re-release in Barcelona (Phenomena) in 2016. The film was projected for 1 day in subtitled version.', u""Jack Palance, Joe Don Baker and Nick Nolte were all considered for the role of Conan's father."", u'The model snake was so big they could fit only part of it onto the set at a time.', u'Arnold Schwarzenegger was pretty beaten up after many takes of getting thrown into the fountain. He also got sunburned from hanging on a tree all day.', u'Arnold Schwarzenegger had not heard of the Conan stories by Robert E. Howard when Ed Pressman approached him for the role.', u'Arnold Schwarzenegger later went on record in an interview that he was born to play Conan.', u""Conan's crucifixion, death and resurrection was influence by the death and resurrection of Jesus."", u'The casting of Arnold Schwarzenegger as Conan, has made certain scholars and reviewers point that this turns Conan from a Celtic into a Germanic character. Some have called him ""Aryan"". Some viewed the film as a tale of the victory of a Germanic/Aryan hero over a black/African villain, giving the film a racial theme.', u'Some critics of both Conan and other sword and sorcery films believe that they are influenced to various degrees with fascist ideology. Others have pointed to perceived influences from the films of director Leni Riefenstahl, who is strongly associated with Nazi Germany.', u'In the Conan stories by Marvel Comics, Thulsa Doom does not need a full body to survive. After his body was destroyed, his skull remained. It was sentient, could still communicate with others and manipulate them to his own goals.', u'The ""puddles of human blood"" depicted in the floors of certain scenes were mostly animal blood gathered from slaughterhouses.', u'John Milius wanted the village attack to be violent to show the impact.', u'Robert E. Howard created a formula for the average Conan story. The formula had Conan ""rescuing a damsel in distress from a monster in some ruins."" While these stories are not considered among the better or more ambitious ones in the Conan series, they were the easiest to write and easiest to sell during the Great Depression. The film creators chose to largely ignore them as sources.', u'Some of the last Conan tales by Robert E. Howard involved conflicts with the savage Picts in the Western borders of the Hyborian kingdoms. These stories were inspired by the American Indian Wars and had strong Western genre elements. By this point in his life, Howard had found a new fascination with the tales of elderly American Civil War veterans, Texas Rangers, and pioneers.', u""Among Robert E. Howard's tales for some of his series characters were elements of burlesque and slapstick. These elements tend to be absent from the Conan tales."", u'Writer L. Sprague de Camp converted several Robert E. Howard about other protagonists and other settings to Conan tales set in the Hyborian Age. For example, the story ""Hawks over Egypt"" which was originally set during the last year of the reign of Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah, Fatimid caliph (reigned 996-1021) was reworked to ""Hawks over Shem."" The process of rewritings involved changing names, eliminating gunpowder, and dragging in a supernatural element.""', u'Thulsa Doom\'s cult seems to worship the serpent god Set. Set worship features prominently in the Conan stories since his first appearance in 1932 and in many of the adaptations. He is the main deity of the Stygians, who offer him human sacrifices: ""chained captives had knelt by the hundreds during festivals to have their heads hacked off by the priest-king in honor of Set"".', u'In the original draft of the screenplay by Oliver Stone, the film took place in a post apocalyptic world inhabited by mutants and animals.', u'The script called for weapons of many different kinds.', u'In the Spanish dubbed voices there are two mismatches with the original English: the first happens during the narration in the prologue, where ""hijos de Aryas"" (sons of Aryas) was misspelled as ""soles de Aries"" (suns of Aries). The second happens when Conan and Subotai meets by first time with Valeria, after Conan misspelling ""No eres un guarda"" (you\'re not a guard) as ""No eres una diosa"" (you\'re not a god), creating an unwitting third mismatch about god/goddess. Although there is no explanation about these changes, it were caused probably due to phonetics similarities.', u""The film was released three months and three weeks after what would have been Robert E. Howard's 76th birthday."", u""When Thulsa Doom (James Earl Jones) points to one of his priestesses and she jumps to her death, a women's free fall record was set at 182 feet by stunt woman Corrie Jansen."", u'Arnold Schwarzenegger said in the behind the scenes features that during the crucifixion scene, they used a live vulture to peck at his wounds. Then for the close up they used a real dead vulture they found for him to actually bite into its throat. After they cut, they immediately had Arnold rinse his mouth out to avoid disease.', u""The script called for Conan to throw a torch into the palace's central window/balcony. Arnold Schwarzenegger missed on the first attempt, but no retake was possible as the set proceeded to burn to the ground, as intended."", u""Conan's prayer to Crom just before the Battle Of The Mounds begins is his last dialogue in the movie."", u""King Osric's death was cut from the film, in which he is murdered in his throne room by Thulsa Doom's henchmen. It can be found on the DVD."", u'The scene of the crucifixion on the dead tree was shot in Almeria, Spain. When Conan is nursed back to health, we can see mysterious magical figures drawn all over his face. One of them is the ""indalo"" (a red symbol resembling a man with his arms over his head), a traditional symbol of the province of Almer\xeda used since ancient times by the local inhabitants to expel witches and lightning. Now it has become a symbol and tourist trademark icon for the province and its tourism industry.']","[u'Sweden::2 April 1982', u'France::7 April 1982', u'Spain::15 April 1982', u'Netherlands::29 April 1982', u'Greece::14 May 1982', u'USA::14 May 1982', u'Argentina::20 May 1982', u'Japan::3 July 1982', u'Brazil::9 July 1982', u'Peru::28 July 1982', u'Colombia::5 August 1982', u'Denmark::6 August 1982', u'Finland::20 August 1982', u'West Germany::25 August 1982', u'UK::26 August 1982', u'Italy::10 September 1982', u'Hong Kong::16 September 1982', u'Portugal::30 September 1982', u'Ireland::15 October 1982', u'Norway::28 October 1982', u'Australia::16 December 1982', u'South Korea::20 May 1983', u'Turkey::14 November 1983', u'Czechoslovakia::1 January 1991', u'Italy::November 2002 (Turin Film Festival)', u'Spain::8 June 2012 (Phenomena - Barcelona) (subtitled version)\n (premiere)', u'Spain::20 April 2016 (Barcelona) (re-release) (subtitled version)', u'France::5 October 2016 (Absurde Seance)']",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Her first draft was too long, and she shortened it, but the ending was inconclusive. She had Marlowe shooting Terry Lennox. Altman conceived of the film as a satire and made several changes to the script, like having Roger Wade commit suicide and having Marty Augustine smash a Coke bottle across his girlfriend\'s face.
