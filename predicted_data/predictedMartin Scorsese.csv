Scorsese had been talking about directing an adaptation since 1980s and entered the first of many written agreements in 1990. At the time, it was to be the next feature Scorsese directed after Kundun (1997).

Following another negotiation, Scorsese agreed to pay various fees after each feature he directed prior to the adaptation including The Departed (2006), Shutter Island (2010) and Hugo (2011). When Scorsese agreed to direct The Wolf of Wall Street (2013) in 2012, Cecchi Gori Pictures filed suit claiming two breaches of written contract, intentional misrepresentation and negligent misrepresentation. The final two charges stemmed from the beliefs that Scorsese and Sikelia Productions falsely represented their plans to make the film in question after ""Hugo,"" which included $1.5 million, plus 20% of all ""back-end"" compensation received by the director, related to ""Hugo."" Scorsese claimed that the lawsuit ""has all the earmarks of a media stunt,"" and for a while it looked like the film was caught in limbo until January 17, 2014 when the sides came to a mutual agreement in a legal settlement.

The chest beating and humming performed by him was improvised and actually a warm-up rite that he performs before acting. When Leonardo DiCaprio saw it while filming, the brief shot of him looking away uneasily from the camera was actually him looking at Martin Scorsese for approval. DiCaprio encouraged them to include it in their scene and later claimed it ""set the tone"" for the rest of the film.', u'The actors snorted crushed B vitamins for scenes that involved cocaine. Jonah Hill claimed that he eventually became sick with bronchitis after so much inhaling and had to be hospitalized.', u'Wanting to work with Martin Scorsese, Jonah Hill took a pay cut by being paid the S.A.G. minimum, which was $60,000.', u""Grossing $392 million worldwide, this is Martin Scorsese's highest grossing film of his career."", u""Martin Scorsese claimed that the sequence of Jordan attempting to get in his car while extremely impaired on Lemmons was improvised on the day of filming, and that it was Leonardo DiCaprio's idea to open the car door with his foot. DiCaprio strained his back during the scene, and was only able to perform the stunt once."", u'The majority of the film was improvised, as Martin Scorsese often encourages.', u'On a routine visit, Steven Spielberg spent a day on the set, watching the shoot of the Steve Madden speech. Martin Scorsese claims that Spielberg essentially codirected the scene, giving advice to actors and suggesting camera angles.', u'Margot Robbie claimed that her sex scene with Leonardo DiCaprio on a bed full of cash was extremely uncomfortable, as the fake paper bills had sharp edges resulting in multiple paper cuts to her back.', u'Originally, Martin Scorsese offered Margot Robbie to appear wearing a bath-robe during the seduction scene between her and Leonardo DiCaprio. Robbie refused and insisted on doing the scene fully nude; her first in her career. According to Robbie: ""The whole point of Naomi is that her body is her only form of currency in this world...She has to be naked. She\'s laying her cards on the table."" Robbie said she had three shots of tequila in succession before shooting the scene to relax. After shooting was complete, Robbie initially fibbed to her family and friends about actually doing the nude scene in order to delay any personal repercussions; claiming C.G.I. was used to superimpose her head on a body-double. She eventually changed her mind and confessed when the film was released.', u'Jordan Belfort coached Leonardo DiCaprio on his behavior, especially instructing him in the various ways he had reacted to the Quaaludes he abused as well as his dope-induced confrontation with Danny Porush.', u'Martin Scorsese has confirmed that some of the editing is odd on purpose, especially the scenes where one or more characters are high, every time Jordan is seen taking drugs the scenes that follow have continuity issues and often flow oddly.', u'During the kissing scene between Leonardo DiCaprio and Joanna Lumley, DiCaprio was so nervous that the scene required a reported twenty-seven takes to get it right.', u""The word 'fuck' and its numerous conjugations are said 569 times, making this the film with the most uses of the word in a main-stream, R-Rated, non-documentary film."", u""Leonardo DiCaprio was paid $25 million for his role, a quarter of the film's budget, making him the highest paid star of the year."", u""During the search for the right Donnie Azoff, Martin Scorsese had requested a meeting with Jonah Hill, but Hill demanded he audition for the part. It was Hill's first audition in six years."", u'Jonah Hill had an audible lisp when he first put in the fake teeth to play Donnie. To get rid of this, he spent over two hours on the phone calling random businesses and talking with them.', u'Martin Scorsese said that there were actual real-life stockbrokers on the set, some of whom actually worked at the real Stratton-Oakmont firm.', u""Leonardo DiCaprio was obsessed with playing Jordan Belfort since getting hold of the book back in 2007, DiCaprio has been focused on turning the depraved tale of Jordan Belfort into a film. However, he wasn't just interested in this story's connection to the most recent collapse on Wall Street, he was also attracted to Jordan's honest and uncompromising portrayal of what he actually experienced."", u'Martin Scorsese needed a pick-up shot of the ""fasten your seat belt"" blinking sign for the airplane scene but didn\'t want to waste time and money on setting up a gimbal. Robert Legato, the effects supervisor, took a reference video of one during a flight with his iPhone to show Scorsese. Upon seeing the footage, Scorsese said ""Great. Let\'s just use that."" Thus, the film became Scorsese\'s first to incorporate footage taken from an iPhone.', u'This movie was banned in 5 countries due to high sexual content.', u'In one of Jordan Belfort\'s speeches he mentioned the phrase ""there is no nobility in poverty"". He was quoting Charlie Sheen from the movie Wall Street (1987)', u""The real Jordan Belfort supported the film's depiction of excess as true to life, though he pointed out that the film leaves the impression that Stratton Oakmont never did any serious work. Belfort argued that they could not have gotten away with their corrupt practices for so long unless they had been delivering on legitimate business most of the time."", u""The real Mark Hanna, who was portrayed by Matthew McConaughey, stated he bought 25% of Jordan Belfort's business and worked with him for two more years. This was not depicted in the film."", u'Leonardo DiCaprio says that he and Martin Scorsese were able to \'push the envelope\' with their depiction of over-the-top sexual acts and scenes in ""Wolf"" and \'make the movie they wanted to\' primarily because the production was financed independently, and not by any major studio. Scorsese did, however, edit some sexual content and nudity to avoid an NC-17 rating at the request of the MPAA.', u'The real Jordon Belfort makes a cameo appearance in the final scene. He is the one who introduces Jordan Belfort (Leonardo Dicaprio) at the motivational speaking event.', u""In an interview with Margot Robbie, she reveals that for the scene where Jordan and Naomi have sex for the first time in her apartment and her dog tries to jump up and bite him that they had trouble getting the dog to jump, so they had to put dog food and chicken livers all over Leonardo DiCaprio's feet and between his toes."", u'This film broke the Guinness World Record for the most swearing in one movie: 681 expletives (equal to 3.81 swears per minute).', u'The scene when Leonardo Di Caprio and Matthew McConaughey are having lunch is supposed to take place in a World Trade Center building.', u""Leonardo DiCaprio's dance scene was done on the spot, but he learned it by himself over decades."", u'Footage of the actual 1991 Hamptons beach party is shown in the film, with Jordan Belfort and then-fianc\xe9e Nadine Caridi (""Naomi Belfort"") can be found on YouTube.', u""In order to show Jordan's state of mind, director of photography Rodrigo Prieto constantly switched lens types. For scenes where Jordan is in a clear mental state, flat spherical lenses are used, while in sections where he does not, anamorphic lenses are used.

The derailment scene during Hugo's dream is a reference to the famous 1895 derailment at the station."", u'In the very last shot of the film, of the automaton, the costume designers made a little tuxedo for the automaton to wear because the very last scene is a party and the costume designers felt that the automaton should be dressed up just like everyone else. Martin Scorsese decided against this because he wanted the audience to see all of the gears of the automaton at the end.', u""While much of the magic performed is period appropriate there are a few pieces in the film which are modern adaptations of classic pieces. The rising card is one of these pieces. It was created and performed on stage by Howard Thurston in the early 1900's.

Scorsese had been talking about directing an adaptation since 1980s and entered the first of many written agreements in 1990. At the time, it was to be the next feature Scorsese directed after Kundun (1997). He then opted to direct a series of features rather than the film in question, including Bringing Out the Dead (1999), Gangs of New York (2002) and Lent\xe4j\xe4 (2004), allegedly agreeing to direct the film after the latter, which didn\'t happen. Following another negotiation, Scorsese agreed to pay various fees after each feature he directed prior to the adaptation including The Departed (2006), Shutter Island (2010) and Hugo (2011). When Scorsese agreed to direct The Wolf of Wall Street (2013) in 2012, Cecchi Gori Pictures filed suit claiming two breaches of written contract, intentional misrepresentation and negligent misrepresentation. The final two charges stemmed from the beliefs that Scorsese and Sikelia Productions falsely represented their plans to make the film in question after ""Hugo,"" which included $1.5 million, plus 20% of all ""back-end"" compensation received by the director, related to ""Hugo."" Scorsese claimed that the lawsuit ""has all the earmarks of a media stunt,"" and for a while it looked like the film was caught in limbo until January 17, 2014 when the sides came to a mutual agreement in a legal settlement.

Neeson in Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace (1999) as Qui-Gon Jinn, and Driver in Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015) as Kylo Ren.', u""Tadanobu Asano, Liam Neeson, and Andrew Garfield have portrayed comic book characters.

Even though there were many differences between them (including ""30 Rock"" being a half-hour sitcom while ""Studio 60"" was an hour-long drama), many critics compared the two shows and engaged in speculation about which one would survive. ""Studio 60"" was canceled after one season, and creator Aaron Sorkin and former regular Nate Corddry both went on to guest-star on ""30 Rock.""', u'In an unusual move for a modern sitcom, the show is shot on (more expensive) film stock rather than in digital.', u'The show was finally syndicated in 2009, something Tina Fey had always complained about.', u'Aside from the main cast and the supporting actors credited at the beginning of each episode (Tracy\'s entourage and ""TGS"" employees), the only actors who appeared in every season are Elaine Stritch, Will Arnett, Chris Parnell and Dean Winters.', u'Season 3 saw an influx of special guest appearances, including Steve Martin, Jennifer Aniston, Oprah Winfrey, Megan Mullally, Jon Hamm, Salma Hayek and Alan Alda.', u""In several episodes in season 4 there is a picture of Kristen Wiig on Jack Donaghy's window sill behind his desk."", u'Andrea Martin was offered the role of Margaret Lemon but her commitments to the Broadway musical adaptation of Young Frankenstein (1974) prevented her from appearing.

In the episode, he tells Jenna that the Prince wishes to meet her and introduces them.', u'In an episode of Season one, Jack (Alec Baldwin) mentions watching ""Friends"" (1994) and makes several references to the show. Baldwin made an appearance in Friends as Parker, the overly enthusiastic guy Phoebe goes out with in Season 8. Also, David Schwimmer and Jennifer Aniston (Ross and Rachel in Friends) both guest starred in 30 Rock during Seasons 2 and 3 (Schwimmer in Season 2 and Aniston in Season 3 respectively).', u'Liz says the first line of the series and Kenneth says the last line.', u'Jason Sudeikis and James Marsden share the same birthday (September 18) and both played love interests of Liz Lemon.', u'In 30 Rock: The Ones (2009) Kenneth states his real name shortly before suffering an allergic shock being Dick Whitman.

At The 64th Annual Golden Globe Awards (2007), Tim Allen mispronounced the show\'s name as ""3rd Rock"" when mentioning that Alec Baldwin had been nominated for the Best Actor in a Television Comedy or Musical Award. Both shows featured guest appearances by Elaine Stritch as the mother of one of the main characters.', u'Tina Fey and Scott Adsit both did voice work for the pinball game Medieval Madness.', u'Donald Glover, who was a staff writer for 30 Rock from 2008-2009, also appeared on camera in several fleeting appearances during that period (for instance, as Young P.A in ""Jack-Tor"" or as Gay Kid in ""Kidney Now!""). After he left the staff of 30 Rock for a role on Community (which made him a star), he returned to play Young Tracy Jordan in the 2012 live episode. During an April 2012 interview with Entertainment Weekly, Tina Fey said that they already knew that Glover ""could sound like Tracy, because we did an extended version of [Tracy Jordan\'s novelty song] \'Werewolf Bar Mitzvah,\' and by the time we finished it, we were wrapped and didn\'t have Tracy. So half of it is just Donald imitating Tracy.""', u'A running gag is the mispronunciation of the film ""Rural Juror"", which Jenna starred in series 1. It is often just pronounced as ""Rrurr Jjurr"". In the season 7 finale, Jenna sings the theme song of the musical ""Rural Juror"". The song itself has utterly incomprehensible lyrics for the public. However, it is the first time Jenna pronounces ""Rural Juror"" correctly. One of the lyrics that was pronounced perfectly was ""I----- will never forget you, rural juror."" The sentiment can be interpreted as Jenna/Jane/the writers of 30 Rock expressing their sadness over the show\'s end.', u""Rachel Dratch's appearance as various characters throughout the show is a fourth-wall-busting display of improv, a topic in many of the episodes."", u'Will Forte, Mary Steenbergen, and Kristen Schaal all guest starred on 30 Rock before going on to star in The Last Man on Earth (2015-)', u'Tina Fey (Liz Lemon), Jack McBrayer (Kenneth Parcell), and Scott Adsit (Pete Hornberger) have all provided their voices for work in Disney films. Fey in Monkey Kingdom (2015), McBrayer starred as Fix It Felix in Wreck It Ralph (2012), and Adsit as Baymax in Big Hero 6 (2014).', u'Over the course of the series, there were many hints that Kenneth was considerably older than the character\'s outward appearance would suggest (the actor who plays Kenneth, Jack McBrayer, was in his early 30s when ""30 Rock"" started). These include: Kenneth\'s recognition of TV pop culture from decades before he logically would have been born; he\'s familiar with the laws of the Roman Republic and fluent in Latin; his anxiety in ""Don Geiss, America and Hope"" that NBC will start limiting and verifying the ages of their pages and his concern in ""The Problem Solvers"" that people in the office have been spreading a rumor that he\'s ""been alive forever""; his memory that an eight-year-old \'Shirley Temple (I)\' taught him how to roll cigarettes; his refusal to tell Suze Orman his age in ""Today You Are a Man""; his on-screen identification as ""Kenneth Parcell: Elderly Page"" in ""Queen of Jordan""; and many other jokes and references. In the episode ""Governor Dunston,"" Kenneth\'s mother (Catherine O\'Hara) visits and tells Jenna that Kenneth has ""always been a special boy. I remember the day he was born. He looked up at me and said, \'Momma, I am not a person. My body\'s just a flesh vessel for an immortal being whose name if you heard it would make you lose your mind.\'"" In the last episode of the series, Kenneth looks to be exactly the same even many decades in the future, still the president of NBC, hearing a series pitch from Liz\'s great-granddaughter; many viewers speculated that that meant that Kenneth is actually immortal.', u'Kenneth said in an episode that when he first started at NBC, an 8 year old Shirley Temple taught him how to roll a cigarette. Shirley Temple was born in 1928 which means Kenneth started at NBC in 1936.', u""The show often pokes fun at themes and characters that the show leaves hanging. For example, in one episode, Kenneth tells Liz that no more mail could fit into her box because it was stuffed with unopened adoption letters, hinting at Liz's disappeared interest to adopt a child. Another instance is the character of Danny Baker. In one episode, Pete tells Danny that he would've asked Danny to do a favor for him, but he forgot he works at TGS, poking fun at the fact that Danny often goes missing for several episodes at a time. Again, in the 100th episode, Danny states that he remembers season 1 of TGS, even though he hadn't worked there yet, but then later in the episode has Josh's flashbacks, meaning that Danny and Josh share the same fate in which they both appear in several episodes and then are never heard from again."", u'Elizabeth Banks played a character on Scrubs (2001) who was impregnated by a character named J.D.

To develop the unique, lost accents of the Yankee ""Nativists"" such as Daniel Day-Lewis\' character, Monich studied old poems, ballads, newspaper articles (which sometimes imitated spoken dialect as a form of humor) and the Rogue\'s Lexicon, a book of underworld idioms compiled by New York\'s police commissioner, so that his men would be able to tell what criminals were talking about. An important piece was an 1892 wax cylinder recording of Walt Whitman reciting four lines of a poem in which he pronounced the word ""world"" as ""woild"", and the ""a"" of ""an"" nasal and flat, like ""ayan"".

Martin Scorsese selected it because it had a quality of sadness to it that he felt fit the mood of the film.', u'United Artists were very frustrated by the amount of time Martin Scorsese took during post-production, thinking he was unnecessarily slow. Scorsese took unusual care as he genuinely believed that Raging Bull (1980) would be his last film and so he didn\'t want to compromise his vision.

Then production shut down for several months, giving Robert De Niro enough time to bulk up for his role as the older and much fatter La Motta. In those months, De Niro gained 60 pounds and practically eating his way through Europe with big meals. DeNiro at one point, would eat a dinner heavy in pasta and drink it down with a vanilla milkshake before going to bed. It was De Niro's idea to do it this way. These scenes were generally shot with the minimum of takes as De Niro would become exhausted much more quickly."", u""Thelma Schoonmaker's husband, director Michael Powell, was consulted about the weight gain scenes. In Powell's The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp (1943), the lead character gets significantly bigger during the course of the movie. Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro were curious how the actor Roger Livesey had achieved that effect. Powell informed them that Livesay had gotten bigger through careful use of camera angles, shaving his hair to make his head appear larger and judicious use of padding. Scorsese and De Niro felt that the film was too realistic to get away with that kind of effect so the decision was made for De Niro to physically bulk up through overeating."", u'When Paul Schrader was working on the script, he put in numerous shocking moments such as Jake LaMotta masturbating and dipping his penis into a bucket of ice. Schrader later admitted that the film held less personal significance to him than it did for Robert De Niro and Martin Scorsese and he added the shocking material just to see what he could get past the studio. Ultimately, the masturbation was cut and, instead of putting his penis into the ice, La Motta pours the ice down his underwear.', u'This differs radically from other boxing movies like Rocky (1976) and Body and Soul (1981) in that the camera was inside the ring for the fight scenes, not outside the ropes.', u""Jake LaMotta's brother Joseph LaMotta sued the production for US $2.5 million for the film's alleged unflattering depiction of him."", u""Martin Scorsese was at one stage so startled by Robert De Niro's weight gain that he shut down production, fearing for the actor's health."", u'Ranked #1 on the American Film Institute\'s list of the 10 greatest films in the genre ""Sports"" in June 2008.', u'According to Martin Scorsese, the script took only two weeks to write on the island of St Martin in the Caribbean.', u'The original script was vetoed by producer Steven Bach after he told Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro that Jake LaMotta was ""a cockroach"".

The first thing Schrader did was drive down to Key West and check the archives of a local newspaper. It was there that he learned that there were two La Mottas, something which is not referenced in Jake LaMotta's autobiography.

Michael Powell, who at that time had become something of a mentor and good friend to Scorsese, suggested that it was the color of the gloves that was throwing them off. Realizing this was true, Scorsese then decided the movie had to be filmed in black and white.', u""Mardik Martin wrote the most traditional, linear script for the film (more of a traditional Jake LaMotta biography), but backed off on the project due to exhaustion after months of research. Paul Schrader made several changes to the script, including making, Joey La Motta, Jake's brother, the second most prominent character (by combining his actions with that of Jake's friend, Peter Savage) and starting the story in the middle of La Motta's career rather than at the beginning. Although they kept Schrader's overall structure, Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro spent 5 weeks rewriting his version of the script until they had exactly the film they wanted (Scorsese and De Niro are uncredited as screenwriters for the film)."", u'Meeting resistance from United Artists about making a boxing film with a dark anti-hero, producers Irwin Winkler and Robert Chartoff refused to tolerate making Rocky II (1979) until Raging Bull (1980) was approved.', u""Jodie Foster didn't audition for Raging Bull. Producers didn't find her suitable for the character of Vickie and considered her as too young and tomboyish. Despite that she still wanted to get the role. Most likely because of her admiration for Robert De Niro and Martin Scorsese's work. Her mom thought about a way to convince the producers that Jodie was no longer the girl from Freaky Friday (1976) or Taxi Driver (1976) anymore but a young woman. The result was a session with photographer Emilio Lari at a rented estate in Los Angeles in the Summer of 1978 when Jodie Foster was fifteen years old. The pictures taken here later found their (unauthorized) way to adult magazines during the John Hinckley aftermath."", u'Neither Director of Photography Michael Chapman nor Martin Scorsese could get the right look for the amateur LaMotta home movies that comprise the only color sequences in ""Raging Bull"".

Winkler, fearing for the actor's health, had objected and suggested the use of prosthetics and makeup as they had money in the budget. But as a method actor who wanted to stay true to the real life subject, De Niro opted to gain the weight required."", u""This marked the first time since his first film Who's That Knocking at My Door (1967) that Martin Scorsese was able to work with his film school friend Thelma Schoonmaker due to her having been denied membership in the then all-male Motion Picture Editors Guild."", u'Although only a few minutes of boxing appear in the movie, they were so precisely choreographed that they took six weeks to film.', u""According to DP Michael Chapman, the actual fight scenes were filmed at the normal 24fps rate. For scenes where Jake retires to his corner between rounds, Chapman gradually overcranked his camera by 'ear' from 24fps up to 48fps as Jake walked away (simultaneously adjusting the diaphragm to maintain exposure consistency), and then reversed procedure as Jake emerged from his corner to resume fighting - all in one shot. For the scene where Jake is doused with water in his corner, Chapman overcranked anywhere from 96fps to 120fps."", u""United Artists were unable to actively promote Raging Bull (1980) for awards consideration as it was then embroiled in serious financial trouble following the Heaven's Gate (1980) debacle."", u'Of all the great dramatic films in history, it was the great Buster Keaton\'s comedy Battling Butler (1926) that was one of Martin Scorsese\'s biggest inspirations in getting the ""feel"" of the boxing scenes just right, particularly (and most likely) from Keaton\'s surprisingly realistic, climactic fight. As quoted in the book ""Martin Scorsese\'s Raging Bull"" edited by Kevin J. Hayes (Cambridge University Press.

Unhappy with the result, the producers hired Paul Schrader to restructure it, and in the course of doing research on La Motta, the writer came across an article on the relationship between Jake and his brother Joey LaMotta. Schrader incorporated the relationship into the revised screenplay, co-opting the Savage character and creating a composite of the two men in the person of Joey La Motta. That relationship became the central plot theme in the revised screenplay and one of the primary reasons for the film's success."", u""The cross that once hung over Martin Scorsese's parents' bed can be seen hanging over Jake LaMotta and Vicki LaMotta's bed."", u""Martin Scorsese was worried about the On the Waterfront (1954) recitation because he knew he'd be inviting critical comparison between the scene in this film and the original film's scene.

Scorsese chose the take in which the recitation is extremely flat specifically to mute the comparison, and to suggest that it is simply a recitation and not indicative of how Jake LaMotta felt about his brother."", u'The home movie sequences were in color to make them stand out from the rest of the film. Another reason was the feeling of reality, because at the particular time represented by the home movies, 8mm color home movie cameras were very popular.', u'Martin Scorsese claims that nothing should be read into his using the On the Waterfront (1954) quote. Jake LaMotta, in his declining years, used to appear on stage reciting dialogue from television plays and even reading William Shakespeare. According to Scorsese, he\'d planned to use something from ""Richard III"" (because in the corresponding real-life event LaMotta used it), but director Michael Powell suggested that ""Richard III"" wouldn\'t work in the context of the film because the film in general and LaMotta in particular are inherently American.

He was fired from the AFI, basically friendless, in the midst of a divorce and was rejected by a girlfriend. Squatting in his ex-girlfriend's apartment while she was away for a couple of months, Schrader literally didn't talk to anyone for many weeks, went to porno theaters and developed an obsession with guns. Schrader was working at the time as delivery man for a chain of chicken restaurants. Spending long days alone in his car, he felt--I might as well be a taxi driver. He also shared with Bickle the sense of isolation from being a mid-Westerner in an urban center. Schrader decided to switch the action to New York City only because taxi drivers are far more common there.

Hermann only accepted after reading the script, and then wrote a highly original score using dissonant brass to punctuate the inner emotions of Travis. After the initial scoring sessions, Scorsese called his composer again, insisting that he needed one more musical cue--a sting, a single frightening chord. Hermann called back a studio orchestra who were paid a day\'s work for that one effect. Shortly after that ultimate session, Hermann died at the age of 64. He had begun his film career in Hollywood writing the music for Citizen Kane (1941).', u'Producer Julia Phillips tells in her auto-biography that Cybill Shepherd had a hard time remembering her lines during the coffee-and-pie scene with Robert De Niro.

The film\'s voice coach, Tim Monich, resisted using a generic Irish brogue and instead focused on distinctive dialects of Ireland and Great Britain. As Leonardo DiCaprio\'s character was born in Ireland but raised in the United States, his accent was designed to be a blend of accents typical of the half-Americanized. To develop the unique, lost accents of the Yankee ""Nativists"" such as Daniel Day-Lewis\' character, Monich studied old poems, ballads, newspaper articles (which sometimes imitated spoken dialect as a form of humor) and the Rogue\'s Lexicon, a book of underworld idioms compiled by New York\'s police commissioner, so that his men would be able to tell what criminals were talking about. An important piece was an 1892 wax cylinder recording of Walt Whitman reciting four lines of a poem in which he pronounced the word ""world"" as ""woild"", and the ""a"" of ""an"" nasal and flat, like ""ayan"".

Trying to get McCarthy to give up the identity of the man who helped him kill the Scalvos, Spilotro first beat McCarthy, then stabbed him in the testicles with an icepick, before finally shoving his head in a vise and crunching it to five inches wide; McCarthy didn\'t give up the name of his partner, Jimmy Miraglia, until Spilotro tightened the vise in such a way that one of Billy\'s eyes popped out. Amazingly, McCarthy survived the head-crushing long enough for Spilotro to kill him by dousing him in lighter fluid and setting him ablaze.

Martin Scorsese selected it because it had a quality of sadness to it that he felt fit the mood of the film.', u'United Artists were very frustrated by the amount of time Martin Scorsese took during post-production, thinking he was unnecessarily slow. Scorsese took unusual care as he genuinely believed that Raging Bull (1980) would be his last film and so he didn\'t want to compromise his vision. Conversely, as he neared completion, he also felt that the film was a form of cinematic rebirth for him. For this reason, he dedicates the film to his film professor (from New York University) Haig Manoogian ""with love and resolution"". Manoogian had helped Scorsese get his first film produced.', u'It is claimed in this film that Jake LaMotta was never knocked down but in real life LaMotta was knocked down by Danny Nardico in a fight in Coral Gables, Florida.', u'Robert De Niro read the autobiography of Jake LaMotta while filming The Godfather: Part II (1974) in 1974 and immediately saw the potential for a film to make with his collaborator, Martin Scorsese. It took over four years for De Niro to convince everyone, including Scorsese, to get on board for this film.', u'Joe Pesci, at the time a frustrated, struggling actor, had to be persuaded to make the film rather than return to the musical act he shared with fellow actor Frank Vincent.', u""The majority of the film with Jake LaMotta as a younger man - including the boxing scenes - were shot first. Then production shut down for several months, giving Robert De Niro enough time to bulk up for his role as the older and much fatter La Motta. In those months, De Niro gained 60 pounds and practically eating his way through Europe with big meals. DeNiro at one point, would eat a dinner heavy in pasta and drink it down with a vanilla milkshake before going to bed. It was De Niro's idea to do it this way. These scenes were generally shot with the minimum of takes as De Niro would become exhausted much more quickly."", u""Thelma Schoonmaker's husband, director Michael Powell, was consulted about the weight gain scenes. In Powell's The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp (1943), the lead character gets significantly bigger during the course of the movie. Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro were curious how the actor Roger Livesey had achieved that effect. Powell informed them that Livesay had gotten bigger through careful use of camera angles, shaving his hair to make his head appear larger and judicious use of padding. Scorsese and De Niro felt that the film was too realistic to get away with that kind of effect so the decision was made for De Niro to physically bulk up through overeating."", u'When Paul Schrader was working on the script, he put in numerous shocking moments such as Jake LaMotta masturbating and dipping his penis into a bucket of ice. Schrader later admitted that the film held less personal significance to him than it did for Robert De Niro and Martin Scorsese and he added the shocking material just to see what he could get past the studio. Ultimately, the masturbation was cut and, instead of putting his penis into the ice, La Motta pours the ice down his underwear.', u'This differs radically from other boxing movies like Rocky (1976) and Body and Soul (1981) in that the camera was inside the ring for the fight scenes, not outside the ropes.', u""Jake LaMotta's brother Joseph LaMotta sued the production for US $2.5 million for the film's alleged unflattering depiction of him."", u""Martin Scorsese was at one stage so startled by Robert De Niro's weight gain that he shut down production, fearing for the actor's health."", u'Ranked #1 on the American Film Institute\'s list of the 10 greatest films in the genre ""Sports"" in June 2008.', u'According to Martin Scorsese, the script took only two weeks to write on the island of St Martin in the Caribbean.', u'The original script was vetoed by producer Steven Bach after he told Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro that Jake LaMotta was ""a cockroach"".

The first thing Schrader did was drive down to Key West and check the archives of a local newspaper.

That was when Schrader knew he had found the hook for the screenplay."", u""The boxing scenes amount to barely 10 minutes of the film's running time."", u""Cathy Moriarty's film debut."", u'While preparing to play Jake LaMotta, Robert De Niro actually met with La Motta and became very well acquainted with him. They spent the entire shoot together so De Niro could portray his character accurately. La Motta said that De Niro has the ability to be a contender, and that he would have been happy to be his manager and trainer.', u'According to Martin Scorsese on the DVD, when first screening some test 8mm footage of Robert De Niro sparring in a ring, he felt that something was off about the image. Michael Powell, who at that time had become something of a mentor and good friend to Scorsese, suggested that it was the color of the gloves that was throwing them off. Realizing this was true, Scorsese then decided the movie had to be filmed in black and white.', u""Mardik Martin wrote the most traditional, linear script for the film (more of a traditional Jake LaMotta biography), but backed off on the project due to exhaustion after months of research. Paul Schrader made several changes to the script, including making, Joey La Motta, Jake's brother, the second most prominent character (by combining his actions with that of Jake's friend, Peter Savage) and starting the story in the middle of La Motta's career rather than at the beginning. Although they kept Schrader's overall structure, Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro spent 5 weeks rewriting his version of the script until they had exactly the film they wanted (Scorsese and De Niro are uncredited as screenwriters for the film)."", u'Meeting resistance from United Artists about making a boxing film with a dark anti-hero, producers Irwin Winkler and Robert Chartoff refused to tolerate making Rocky II (1979) until Raging Bull (1980) was approved.', u""Jodie Foster didn't audition for Raging Bull. Producers didn't find her suitable for the character of Vickie and considered her as too young and tomboyish. Despite that she still wanted to get the role. Most likely because of her admiration for Robert De Niro and Martin Scorsese's work. Her mom thought about a way to convince the producers that Jodie was no longer the girl from Freaky Friday (1976) or Taxi Driver (1976) anymore but a young woman. The result was a session with photographer Emilio Lari at a rented estate in Los Angeles in the Summer of 1978 when Jodie Foster was fifteen years old. The pictures taken here later found their (unauthorized) way to adult magazines during the John Hinckley aftermath."", u'Neither Director of Photography Michael Chapman nor Martin Scorsese could get the right look for the amateur LaMotta home movies that comprise the only color sequences in ""Raging Bull"".

For scenes where Jake retires to his corner between rounds, Chapman gradually overcranked his camera by 'ear' from 24fps up to 48fps as Jake walked away (simultaneously adjusting the diaphragm to maintain exposure consistency), and then reversed procedure as Jake emerged from his corner to resume fighting - all in one shot. For the scene where Jake is doused with water in his corner, Chapman overcranked anywhere from 96fps to 120fps."", u""United Artists were unable to actively promote Raging Bull (1980) for awards consideration as it was then embroiled in serious financial trouble following the Heaven's Gate (1980) debacle."", u'Of all the great dramatic films in history, it was the great Buster Keaton\'s comedy Battling Butler (1926) that was one of Martin Scorsese\'s biggest inspirations in getting the ""feel"" of the boxing scenes just right, particularly (and most likely) from Keaton\'s surprisingly realistic, climactic fight. As quoted in the book ""Martin Scorsese\'s Raging Bull"" edited by Kevin J. Hayes (Cambridge University Press.

Unhappy with the result, the producers hired Paul Schrader to restructure it, and in the course of doing research on La Motta, the writer came across an article on the relationship between Jake and his brother Joey LaMotta. Schrader incorporated the relationship into the revised screenplay, co-opting the Savage character and creating a composite of the two men in the person of Joey La Motta.

Another reason was the feeling of reality, because at the particular time represented by the home movies, 8mm color home movie cameras were very popular.', u'Martin Scorsese claims that nothing should be read into his using the On the Waterfront (1954) quote. Jake LaMotta, in his declining years, used to appear on stage reciting dialogue from television plays and even reading William Shakespeare. According to Scorsese, he\'d planned to use something from ""Richard III"" (because in the corresponding real-life event LaMotta used it), but director Michael Powell suggested that ""Richard III"" wouldn\'t work in the context of the film because the film in general and LaMotta in particular are inherently American.

He was fired from the AFI, basically friendless, in the midst of a divorce and was rejected by a girlfriend. Squatting in his ex-girlfriend's apartment while she was away for a couple of months, Schrader literally didn't talk to anyone for many weeks, went to porno theaters and developed an obsession with guns. Schrader was working at the time as delivery man for a chain of chicken restaurants. Spending long days alone in his car, he felt--I might as well be a taxi driver. He also shared with Bickle the sense of isolation from being a mid-Westerner in an urban center. Schrader decided to switch the action to New York City only because taxi drivers are far more common there. Schrader's script clicked with both Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro when they read it."", u'Robert De Niro has said that, despite having won an Oscar for The Godfather: Part II (1974), he was still a relatively unfamiliar face and was only actually recognized once while driving a New York cab during his research for this film.', u'The producers were looking for a ""Cybill Shepherd"" type to play the female lead in the film.

Hermann only accepted after reading the script, and then wrote a highly original score using dissonant brass to punctuate the inner emotions of Travis. After the initial scoring sessions, Scorsese called his composer again, insisting that he needed one more musical cue--a sting, a single frightening chord. Hermann called back a studio orchestra who were paid a day\'s work for that one effect. Shortly after that ultimate session, Hermann died at the age of 64. He had begun his film career in Hollywood writing the music for Citizen Kane (1941).', u'Producer Julia Phillips tells in her auto-biography that Cybill Shepherd had a hard time remembering her lines during the coffee-and-pie scene with Robert De Niro. She writes that De Niro in particular was getting fed up with her and that Phillips and editor Marcia Lucas laughed over all the unusable footage they had to work with in the editing room.', u""In Paul Schrader's original screenplay, the characters of Sport, the Mafioso and the hotel clerk were all black.

She had two goals: to make a film about woman with real-life problems, and to secure an up-and-coming film maker as the director. Upon selecting this script, Brian De Palma brought Francis Ford Coppola to Burstyn\'s attention who suggested she consider Scorsese. While impressed with Scorsese\'s talent after viewing Mean Streets (1973), Burstyn still hesitated to hire the director, fearing he could only direct men. When she asked Scorsese what he knew about women, Scorsese replied ""Nothing, but I\'d like to learn."" Satisfied with his enthusiasm, Burstyn immediately hired Scorsese.', u""Diane Ladd's daughter Laura Dern can be seen in the final diner scene - she is the little blonde girl with glasses sitting at the end of the counter eating an ice cream cone. As Dern would recall years later, it was after the 19th take - and exactly that many cones consumed - that director Martin Scorsese informed Ladd that if her daughter could do that without throwing up, she had to be an actress."", u'The opening sequence was designed to be an homage to The Wizard of Oz (1939).', u'Ellen Burstyn said she was not prepared for how frightening Harvey Keitel became in the scene where Ben threatens his wife and Alice. ""I had a meltdown after shooting and cried for an hour,"" she said. Martin Scorsese himself, even as well as he knew Keitel, said the actor terrified him from the moment he began his very intense and rather demonic preparations for the scene.', u""The actual restaurant that this movie is based on is located in Phoenix, Arizona at 1747 NW Grand Ave. This restaurant was at one time known as Mel's Diner, then later on Pat's Diner. It has recently changed again, and it is again Mel's Diner (as of May 2006)."", u'Ellen Burstyn improvised the line ""I don\'t sing with my ass,"" supposedly based on her own show business experiences.', u""Diane Ladd played Flo in this movie. In the television series Alice (1976), the part was played by Polly Holliday. When Holliday left the series, Ladd stepped in to portray Belle, the waitress who replaced Flo at Mel's Diner. Vic Tayback reprised his role as Mel in the TV series. Alfred Lutter III played Alice's son Tommy in the pilot episode of the TV series, but was afterwards replaced by Philip McKeon."", u""Lead actress Ellen Burstyn had brought the project to Martin Scorsese and hired him to direct, it. Scorsese then surrounded himself with an extraordinarily supportive staff of strong and very well-connected women, who included his lover Sandra Weintraub (daughter of producer Fred Weintraub )as associate producer; Marcia Lucas (wife of George Lucas ) as film editor; and Toby Carr Rafelson (wife of director/producer Bob Rafelson' ) as production designer."", u'Kris Kristofferson had his own personal emotions and experiences that came up during production. He later said he had guilty feelings because of the two kids he left behind in a broken marriage when he went off on his ""quest to become what I was becoming."" In the story, his character is also divorced with children he never sees.', u'Martin Scorsese said later that occasionally they would have trouble with the people who owned buildings where they were shooting but that Kris Kristofferson was always able to smooth it over and buy more time for the crew to complete its work.', u'According to Martin Scorsese, the shot of Alice and Tommy walking off together with a big sign saying ""Monterey"" ahead of them was not planned. It was only when cinematographer Kent L. Wakeford alerted him that it was in the shot that Scorsese became aware of it and very excited by it, instructing Wakeford not to crop it out of the frame.', u'According to Ellen Burstyn, Warner Bros. executives wanted to cut the opening sequence of Alice as a little girl in Monterey but Martin Scorsese told them they would have to take his name off the picture if they did.', u'The production presented Ellen Burstyn with a new challenge -singing. ""I have the worst voice,"" she explained. ""I can\'t carry a tune, but I was determined not to have Marni Nixon sing for me."" She spent six months with piano and singing teachers to prepare.', u'Martin Scorsese told Kris Kristofferson not to worry about the acting directions in the script but to think of how he would say it himself. He said the director did everything to bolster his confidence, including telling him complimentary things other people said about him.', u""This movie is very similar to This Boy's Life (1993), which is by the same writer."", u'Shirley MacLaine turned down the role of Alice Hyatt. She admitted regretting it.', u""As is common in casting child actors, Alfred Lutter III's personality contained many of the characteristics the filmmakers sought for his character, Tommy. Martin Scorsese mentions that the pointless shoot-the-dog story was improvised into the script after a long van ride back from a location shoot during which Alfred incessantly repeated the story to Martin. Martin wanted to get that feeling of being a captive audience subject to the relentless retelling of the nonsense story into the film, so they improvised it into the script as Tommy repeating it to his mother and later to David."", u'Martin Scorsese said one of his favorite leading men to direct was Kris Kristofferson, since he represented the strong, silent masculine hero that Scorsese always looked up to but rarely worked with throughout his career.', u'At the time of shooting, Ellen Burstyn (Alice) was real-life best friends with her on-screen best friend Lelia Goldoni (Bea).', u'According to Ellen Burstyn, Kris Kristofferson was ""slightly daunted at the time [of production]. He was young in his film career and not sure of himself.""', u'Martin Scorsese allowed the actors freedom to improvise during shooting. Ellen Burstyn credited the great results with how ""everyone on the set gets turned on by the enormous creative energy of Martin Scorsese.""', u'Ellen Burstyn wrote in her autobiography that she considered the scene between Alice and David in her kitchen, where she improvised the story of her and her brother doing an act together, ""the best scene in the film; the most real and the best example of what Marty\'s kind of directing can do.""', u'The scenes in the ranch house owned by David were shot in a real home. The company relocated the couple who lived there for a set time to do the shoot, but delays kept the production there longer. When the couple came home on the agreed date, they sat in the room during the shooting of the final scenes at that location. They grew more and more impatient, demanding to know why Martin Scorsese was calling for retakes and insisting what they had seen was perfectly fine. ""Has anybody ever made a movie like this?"" Scorsese wondered.', u'Martin Scorsese felt that Ben, needed to be the ""most accurately delineated"" character in the movie. He said he and Harvey Keitel worked together to make Ben both funnier and crazier.', u'The purpose for the highly stylized opening, according to Martin Scorsese, was to find a way to represent how Alice saw her past. ""In her mind, Monterey is fantasy, pure illusion. So I shot a flashback [to the late 1940s] as if it were a Hollywood movie being made on a soundstage. Unreal. Because that\'s where Alice is at.""', u'Martin Scorsese found the process of working on the film to be very draining and found the Ben scenes to be particularly cathartic for him. He told interviewer Tony Macklin during production, ""It\'s my own relationship with people I\'m in love with, relationship with my friends. Harvey--what he represents of me in that film, what he represents to himself. Everybody\'s playing this like a documentary part of themselves in this picture, and so am I.""', u""Kris Kristofferson plays an important role in this movie. In Martin Scorsese's next movie, the widely acclaimed Taxi Driver (1976), there is a scene in which Robert De Niro's character gives Cybill Shepherd's character a Kris Kristofferson vinyl as a present."", u'In a documentary about the making of the film, Ellen Burstyn\' describes how the wind kept whipping her hair around during the scene where Alice and David are talking as he\'s mending fences on his ranch and kiss for the first time. ""The camera operator told me I should always do love scenes in a high wind: \'It does something for you.\'""', u""Martin Scorsese decided to keep the camera in almost constant motion to reflect Alice's emotional turmoil and indecisiveness."", u'Ellen Burstyn often drew on her own experiences, including her relationship with her son, Jefferson, who travelled with her on location wherever she was working and was a young teen at the time of production. He plays the son of her neighbour and best friend of Tommy in the opening sequences set in Socorro, New Mexico. She would tell Martin Scorsese about conversations and incidents between her and her son, as well as things that happened off camera with Lutter, and he would include them in various scenes.', u""Barbra Streisand was originally offered the lead role, but turned it down because she thought she was too young at the time. Also, she didn't think people would accept her as a failed lounge singer."", u""The first cut was three hours and sixteen minutes. Martin Scorsese trimmed it down to just under two hours for its release, losing entire sequences and characters. He was especially unhappy about losing so much of the Socorro sequence, which he believed would have made Alice's husband into a more fleshed-out character. He wanted this part of the movie to be about a third of the picture's running time, but preview audiences were bored with it and felt the movie really didn't get started until she and Tommy hit the road."", u'Ellen Burstyn initially considered asking Barbara Loden to direct the film but decided on Martin Scorsese as she wanted the film to have a ""rough"" look to it.', u'""Alice Doesn\'t Live Here Anymore"" was the title of an episode of The Brady Bunch (1969) that aired on October 17, 1969, more than four years before the film came out. It was based on the 1933 song ""Annie Doesn\'t Live Here Anymore,"" written by Joe Young, Johnny Burke, and Harold Spina, and popularized by Guy Lombardo and His Royal Canadians.', u'According to Ellen Burstyn, nothing daunted Alfred Lutter III. She said he was a ""very secure little boy"" and a lot like his character, which she described as both ""brilliant and annoying.""', u'Martin Scorsese said that Alfred Lutter III improvised the last line in the film, ""Mom, I can\'t breathe,"".', u'Harvey Keitel improvised the bit about the scorpion hanging around his neck.', u'According to her autobiography, Anne Bancroft was attached to the project.', u'The film cast includes two Oscar winners: Ellen Burstyn and Jodie Foster; and four Oscar nominees: Kris Kristofferson, Diane Ladd, Laura Dern and Harvey Keitel.', u'The set for the opening sequence cost $85,000. Martin Scorsese called it ""the first time in my movie career that I was able to build a proper set."" According to Scorsese, he had the services of Darrell Silvera, set decorator of Citizen Kane (1941), The Magnificent Ambersons (1942), and Cat People (1942), along with other pictures from Val Lewton\'s legendary horror unit at RKO in the 1940s. Silvera, however, is not credited.', u'When Ellen Burstyn won the Academy Award for Best Actress, she was not able to attend the Oscars that night to accept her Oscar in person. She asked Martin Scorsese to accept the award on her behalf. She also asked Scorsese to thank himself upon accepting her Oscar.', u'According to Martin Scorsese veteran cinematographer Russell Metty happened to be present at the studio and shot the tests for the opening sequence.', u'Movie critic Pauline Kael recommended to screenwriter Robert Getchell that Robert Altman would have been a good choice to direct the film.', u'While scouting locations in downtown Tucson, Martin Scorsese noticed the Manhattan Bar sign and put the bar in the film in tribute to his New York City hometown.', u'Ellen Burstyn\'s Oscar\xae was delivered to her in a liquor box by Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau at the stage door of the Broadway theater where she was working. She asked Matthau what an Oscar\xae really meant, and he told her, ""Let\'s put it this way, Ellen. When you die, the newspapers will say, \'The Academy Award-winning actress Ellen Burstyn died today.\'""', u'In her autobiography, ""Lessons in Becoming Myself"", Ellen Burstyn lamented not taking producer credit for the project she found and brought to the studio, and for which she hired the director. ""If I\'d been executive producer, I would have been part of the deal when it was sold as a television series and had a piece of what John Calley told me were the \'mega millions\' Warner Bros. made.""', u'The real filming location of Mel\'s Diner from the movie was an actual diner on Main Avenue, called, ""Dukes Drive-In"", which operated from 1940-1971. The owners later added a small motel, which is visible in some scenes. The motel has since been demolished.', u'Vera offers Tommy a book to read: ""The Bride Screamed Murder."" When he holds it up to look through it, you can see that the author\'s name = Terry Molloy. Terry Malloy is the name of Marlon Brando\'s character in On the Waterfront (1954).', u'Martin Scorsese felt that editing down the movie from more than three hours to less than two made the story very simplistic, whereas the longer version ""was quite three-dimensional.""', u""Martin Scorsese was attracted by Ellen Burstyn's background with the Actors Studio. He felt that with New York-trained actors like her, Diane Ladd, Harvey Keitel, and Lelia Goldoni in the cast, he could work with improvisations and incorporate them into the script. The process, he said, was inspired by the films of John Cassavetes."", u'John Calley initially asked Ellen Burstyn if she wanted to direct it herself, but she didn\'t have the confidence. She told him she wanted someone new and exciting and called Francis Ford Coppola for a recommendation. He told her to watch Mean Streets (1973) by Martin Scorsese. Burstyn was very impressed with the picture, but she was concerned because it was very male-dominated. She set up a meeting with the young director, whom she found nervous and uncomfortable. She told him she liked his film but that she wanted this one made from a woman\'s point of view. ""What do you know about women?"" she asked. His pleasant reply--""Nothing, but I\'d like to learn""--won her over.', u'While he was finishing work on the film, Martin Scorsese was also working on his documentary Italianamerican (1974) about his parents. Observers noted that the relationship between Scorsese and his mother in that film echoed the give-and-take between Alice and Tommy in this one.', u'This can be seen as the opposite of the movie Men Don\'t Leave (1990). In ""Alice"" the title character\'s life is resurrected by her husband dying. She is able to leave an abusive marriage, pursue a dream she\'s always had, and become independent for the first time in her life. In ""Men Don\'t Leave"" Jessica Lange\'s husband dies and her life is turned completely upside down. Eventually she finds a job and moves on and survives, but her quality of life deteriorates severely after her husband\'s death.', u'Ellen Burstyn noted in a March 1975 interview that it ""broke the house record for the first week at the Sutton Theater [in New York], and all the men who said it wouldn\'t work are eatin\' crow.""', u'The opening sequence of Alice as a little girl in Monterey was the last footage to be shot on the old Columbia sound stages on Gower Street in Hollywood.', u'Diana Ross was considered for the lead role.', u'Martin Scorsese told film scholar Richard Schickel he was attracted to the project as a way of exploring his ability to make a genre film in Hollywood. ""It was something like a vehicle, like a Bette Davis vehicle or a Joan Crawford vehicle,"" he said. ""So I felt this would be a way of embracing the genre.""', u'Early drafts of the script contained some very different approaches to what was eventually seen on screen. There was some thought of having Alice divorce her husband and run away, but Martin Scorsese liked the idea that his death happened out of the blue--""the hand of God,"" he called it--that forced her to make the decision to change her life.', u'Martin Scorsese scheduled several weeks of rehearsal before principal photography began, allowing the actors to improvise many scenes. Robert Getchell sat in on these sessions, taking notes and incorporating the improvised material into the script.', u""Martin Scorsese was convinced by John Calley that working successfully on the film would show Hollywood that he could make a commercial film from someone else's script with established talents, a big budget, multiple locations, and starring a woman."", u'Martin Scorsese, whose astrological sign is Scorpio, borrowed the scorpion necklace Harvey Keitel wore in the movie and wore it on set during production. He later said it was for him a symbol of the anger he was suppressing while making the film. Scorsese also said the production was ""a kind of therapy for me.""', u'The day after winning her Oscar, Ellen Burstyn received a congratulatory phone call from Jackie Gleason. In her early days, as Erica Dean (one of her many stage names), she worked on his show as a ""Glea Girl,"" a cast of pretty faces who introduced various segments of the program. ""I haven\'t heard from him in 20 years,"" she told the New York Post\'s Earl Wilson. Gleason had also placed a call to Best Actor winner Art Carney. Burstyn later said she really wanted to win alongside Carney, having played his daughter in Harry and Tonto (1974), the film for which he won his award and which she made just prior to this one.', u'Ellen Burstyn said in a contemporary interview with The New York Times: ""I\'m still not entirely happy about the ending, but we don\'t say definitely they\'re getting married. We say that whatever they do will have to include Alice\'s aspirations. I think any way we ended it would have been partly unsatisfactory because this movie is about something we\'re all going through right now, and nobody knows how it\'s all going to end.""', u'Warner Bros. cast Ellen Burstyn after seeing the dailies for The Exorcist (1973). They sent her a number of scripts, but she felt every female in them was either a victim, the understanding wife of the hero, or some sort of sex object, but never the protagonist.', u'The opening fantasy flashback sequence, of which Martin Scorsese was particularly proud and excited, actually drew the most negative reaction from reviewers.', u'Vic Tayback as diner owner Mel was the only cast member to play in the television series adaptation.', u'Ellen Burstyn was eager to work with Martin Scorsese because she liked the vibrant immediacy of Mean Streets and thought that edge could keep Alice from becoming too glib and facile and too much of a formula ""woman\'s picture.""', u'In the earliest version of the script, one Martin Scorsese never saw, Robert Getchell had Tommy commit suicide.', u'At the beginning of the film, Alice promises Tommy that she\'ll take him to Monterey, California, before his birthday; the last shot of the film shows Alice and Tommy walking down a road in Tucson towards a big sign for a shopping center called ""Monterey Village"".
