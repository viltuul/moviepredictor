(Rhino, Shocker, and The Tinkerer are all minor villains in the films)', u'This trivia item contains spoilers for all previous Spider-Man films:) This is the only Spider-Man movie to date without any graveyard scene. All of the previous five installments had graveyard scenes for some of their major characters: 1) Spider-Man - Norman Osborn; 2) Spider-Man 2 - Uncle Ben Parker; 3) Spider-Man 3 - Harry Osborn; 4) The Amazing Spider-Man 1 - Captain Stacey; 5) The Amazing Spider-Man 2- Gwen Stacey.', u'In the film it\'s revealed that Adrian Toomes (aka Vulture) was the mastermind behind a scavenger operation that collected and re-purposed Chitauri Alien weapons before selling them on the Black Market. Throughout each of the NETFLIX Marvel series, the events of the first ""Avengers"" film are simply referred to as ""The Incident."" In the series ""Luke Cage"", the otherwise indestructible main character faces off against his archenemy Diamondback and is severely injured by a bullet that was tied to ""The Incident."" Though it\'s not alluded to in either the series or the film, but it is possible that Diamondback purchased the weapons that he used on Luke from Toomes.', u'During the scene when Peter is picking up Liz for their date, the song ""Save it for Later"" by The English Beat is playing. One of the lines in the lyrics is ""Sooner or later, you\'ll hit the deck and get found out..."". This foreshadows exactly what happens to Peter Parker, as Adrian Toomes soon realizes that Peter is Spider-Man, after the two fought on the deck of the ferry boat.', u'Michael Keaton\'s character is never referred to as The Vulture, however the term ""Vulture guy"" is used by other characters.', u'Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.) and The Vulture (Michael Keaton) share no scenes together.', u'The plane towards the end of the movie, is fitted with retro reflective panels to reflect light, making it invisible. This is a reference to Iron Man 3 when the kid told Tony Stark that he should make a suit with retro reflective panels to: ""go into stealth mode"".', u'During the end of the Washington Monument rescue, the scene pays homage to the previous Spiderman film series, specifically the love interests. When Peter saves Liz right before she falls with the elevator, he webs her by the hand, which is similar to The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014) when Spiderman, portrayed by Andrew Garfield at the time webs his love interest Gwen Stacey (Emma Stone) in the same manner during his battle with Green Goblin. Then after Peter safely places Liz outside the elevator, he is then facing her while hanging upside down. His A.I. Karen tells him to kiss her which is a straight homage to the iconic scene in Spiderman (2002) where Peter, portrayed by Tobey Maguire, is kissing Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) while hanging upside down.', u'On the way to Washington DC, there is a road sign that has the word triskelion in lights. The word is also mentioned a short time later. Triskelion is on the flag from the Isle of Man. Tom Hollands father is from the Isle of Man. This is a reference to the ending of ""Captain America: Winter Soldier"", the three ships shot down at the end are called Heli-Carriers and would, like ""The Incident"" require significant clean up.']","[u'USA::28 June 2017 (Los Angeles, California)\n (premiere)', u'Finland::5 July 2017', u'UK::5 July 2017', u'Indonesia::5 July 2017', u'Ireland::5 July 2017', u'South Korea::5 July 2017', u'Sweden::5 July 2017', u'Taiwan::5 July 2017', u'Albania::6 July 2017', u'Armenia::6 July 2017', u'Argentina::6 July 2017', u'Australia::6 July 2017', u'Brazil::6 July 2017', u'Canada::6 July 2017 (Newfoundland)', u'Chile::6 July 2017', u'Colombia::6 July 2017', u'Czech Republic::6 July 2017', u'Denmark::6 July 2017', u'Georgia::6 July 2017', u'Greece::6 July 2017', u'Hong Kong::6 July 2017', u'Croatia::6 July 2017', u'Hungary::6 July 2017', u'Israel::6 July 2017', u'Italy::6 July 2017', u'Kuwait::6 July 2017', u'Kazakhstan::6 July 2017', u'Mexico::6 July 2017', u'Netherlands::6 July 2017', u'New Zealand::6 July 2017', u'Peru::6 July 2017', u'Philippines::6 July 2017', u'Portugal::6 July 2017', u'Serbia::6 July 2017', u'Russia::6 July 2017', u'Singapore::6 July 2017', u'Slovakia::6 July 2017', u'Ukraine::6 July 2017', u'Uruguay::6 July 2017', u'Bangladesh::7 July 2017', u'Bulgaria::7 July 2017', u'Canada::7 July 2017', u'India::7 July 2017 (India)', u'Cambodia::7 July 2017', u'Sri Lanka::7 July 2017 (Colombo)', u'Norway::7 July 2017', u'Nepal::7 July 2017', u'Romania::7 July 2017', u'Turkey::7 July 2017', u'USA::7 July 2017', u'Vietnam::7 July 2017', u'South Africa::7 July 2017', u'France::12 July 2017', u'Germany::13 July 2017', u'Estonia::14 July 2017', u'Lithuania::14 July 2017', u'Poland::14 July 2017', u'Belgium::19 July 2017', u'Spain::28 July 2017', u'Japan::7 August 2017 (Tokyo)\n (premiere)', u'Japan::11 August 2017', u'China::8 September 2017']",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

It\'s not a utilitarian shot, it\'s a shot where you\'re trying to look heroic.

And I genuinely messed my arm doing that shot because of the strain."" Robert Downey Jr. joked that the film-makers didn\'t mind that Evans hurt himself because of how great the shot turned out and they have been using it to promote the film ever since. Anthony Russo revealed that the iconic shot almost did not happen because on the day of the film-making there was a miscommunication with the costume department and Evans came in wearing a thick jacket.

However, Downey wanted a larger role, which would lead to a bigger payday. Marvel Entertainment CEO Ike Perlmutter was furious over the request, prompting him to order the screenwriters to write Tony Stark out of the script completely.

Woodard was suggested for the role by Robert Downey Jr., before Marvel Studios learned of her casting as Mariah Dillard in Luke Cage (2016).', u""Ann Russo: The wife of co-Director Anthony Russo, provided the voice of Helmut Zemo's wife in the message box of Zemo's phone."", u'Jim Rash: (at around 16 mins) Near the beginning of the film. Rash worked with the Russo Brothers in Community (2009). Another Community star, Danny Pudi, made a cameo appearance in Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014).', u'Sebastian Stan revealed that the backpack that Bucky is seen wearing in the trailers, contains journals that he has put together of his scattered memories.', u'The film reveals that Bucky Barnes has been hiding out in Bucharest, which is the capital, and largest city of Romania. Sebastian Stan, who plays Bucky Barnes in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, is a Romanian-American actor, who was born in Constanta, Romania. In the first scene set in Bucharest, Bucky Barnes is buying fruits on a street market. Stan, who is fluent in Romanian, speaks perfect Romanian.', u'The film shows a bond beginning to form between Scarlet Witch and Vision, who were actually married for a while in the comics.', u'The filmmakers describe betrayal as a crucial theme in the film: ""We didn\'t want the movie to be just about politics, and people arguing about platitudes. The final act is built around a personal act between Tony and Steve.""', u'In the post-credits scene, Peter\'s web shooter emits a light which strongly resembles the ""Spider Signal"" seen in the comics. This is the debut of the Spider Signal on-screen.', u""The appearance of Giant-Man was kept secretive throughout production and marketing, evident from the absence of said character in all trailers and television ads, but this movie's Funko Pop! figurines, and a Lego set, depicting the airport battle scene featured Giant-Man, was released and advertised before the movie's release date."", u'Mark Ruffalo was spotted on the set of the film, thus sparking rumors of a potential Hulk appearance in the film. But his role was ultimately cut from the final draft of the movie script.', u'In the mid-credits scene, waterfalls are shown in the kingdom of Wakanda. These scenes were filmed at the Iguaz\xfa Falls in Misiones, Argentina.', u""at around 2h 5 mins) The image near the end of the film, of Iron Man blasting Captain America's raised shield, is an homage to the Civil War part seven comic book cover."", u'Paul Bettany describes the Vision as exploring what it means to be human and what love is: ""The only way one can guarantee one\'s loyalty is love.""', u'at around 33 mins) The speech which Sharon Carter makes at Peggy\'s funeral, is taken from a speech which Captain America makes in the comic Amazing Spider-Man #537 - ""Doesn\'t matter what the press says. Doesn\'t matter what the politicians or the mobs say. Doesn\'t matter if the whole country decides that something wrong is something right. This nation was founded on one principle above all else: the requirement that we stand up for what we believe, no matter the odds or the consequences.

Most of these words had a meaning specific to him.', u'at around 2h 5 mins) Towards the end of the film, Bucky Barnes loses his left (cybernetic) arm. This continues the Marvel Cinematic Universe tradition of a character losing their left arm or hand started in the Phase 2 films, which pays homage to Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980). Other characters who lost an arm in the Marvel Cinematic Universe films: Aldrich Killian in Iron Man 3 (2013), Thor in Thor: The Dark World (2013), Bucky Barnes in Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014), Nebula in Guardians of the Galaxy (2014), Ulysses Klaue in Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), Phil Coulson in Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (2013), and Darren Cross, a.k.a. Yellow Jacket, in Ant-Man (2015). This, therefore, also marks the second time Bucky loses his left arm in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.', u""By the end of the movie, the Avengers logo on Captain America's arm is no longer there, representing the Avengers are no longer his."", u'In the comics, while Spider-Man started off on Iron Man\'s side, he later shifted over to Captain America\'s side after learning that the Pro-Registration Side was imprisoning the captured unregistered heroes in a prison built in another dimension known as the ""Negative Zone"", against their will, without due process (as it is technically not on American soil) until they agreed to register. In the film, he fights on Iron Man\'s side, before being sent home by Iron Man after the battle at the airport in Germany.', u'at around 2h 10 mins) During the Battle of the HYDRA Siberian Facility, when Captain America is asked by Iron Man to stand down, he responds ""I could do this all day"". This is phrase is also said twice in Captain America: The First Avenger (2011), when Steve Rogers is beaten by a bully in an alley and later by Red Skull. Rogers is rescued or helped directly after the sentence is stated.', u""In the movie, Rhodes' spinal column is severely damaged as the result of an accident while he was in the War Machine suit. As a result, Rhodes uses bionic supports on his legs to move around during his recovery. This is a nod to an incident in the comics when Rhodes was badly injured, and had to receive cybernetic implants for his legs, arms, and part of his face making him part cyborg (similar to DC Comic's Cyborg, who is also a black superhero with cybernetic implants) which lasted until Marvel's Dark Reign event, where Rhodes received a new cloned body, into which his mind to be transferred."", u""Ragnarok (Thor's clone) is an integral part of the comic version of Civil War, but not the movie."", u'Stan Lee: (at around 2h 10 mins) towards the end of the film, as a FedEx delivery man. He mispronounces Tony Stark as Tony ""Stank"".', u""In the comics, the second Giant-Man, Bill Foster, is one of the Anti-Registration heroes, who was killed by Thor's clone Ragnarok during the first battle between both sides. The concept of Scott Lang becoming Giant-Man to fight back against Iron Man's team (who was incapable of enlarging himself in the comics) as well as War Machine being injured as a result of Vision's attack (though it was accidental) are similar to this."", u""Spider-Man has two costumes in the film, his original makeshift one he's seen wearing in YouTube footage and which Tony Stark eventually finds in Peter's apartment, and his new costume, created with Tony's collaboration which more closely resembles the classic costume."", u'at around 33 mins) Part of Sharon Carter\'s eulogy for Peggy Carter, was written as part of the Marvel Civil War in the Spider-Man comics by J. Michael Straczynski, Writer and Creator of Babylon 5 (1994), and credited for the story for Thor (2011). The speech comes from an inspirational speech Captain America gives to Spider-Man during the Marvel Civil War, to explain why he continues to fight against the Superhuman Registration Act, when the country he represents are all for it. As a child, Captain America memorized a monologue that influenced his understanding of what it meant not only to be a patriot, but what it really meant to be an American. The whole philosophy stems from the writing of Mark Twain, on a monologue known as, ""In a Republic, who is the Country?""', u""at around 2h 10 mins) In the climax, before destroying the suit's arc reactor, Cap tears the Iron Man helmet from Tony's face. If he had not done this before the suit lost power, Stark likely would have suffocated, implying that Rogers was simply trying to end the fight rather than kill Tony."", u'In Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014), Captain America, Black Widow, and Falcon are arrested by HYDRA posing as S.H.I.E.L.D., which they escaped, having been freed by Maria Hill. In this movie, Captain America, Falcon, and Winter Soldier are also arrested by German Special Forces, and escape after Winter Soldier goes rogue, with help from Agent 13 Sharon Carter.', u'at around 1h 40 mins) When Redwing hits Iron Man in the head during the airport scene, a circle of ""feathers"", possibly shrapnel, can be seen, as a reference to when characters are hit in cartoons or comics.', u'Multiple references to different themes that aren\'t related to the Marvel Cinematic Universe are made throughout the film: While confined, Falcon tells Iron Man to bring Mark Fuhrman if he wants him to talk (Mark Fuhrman was a key part in the 1994-5 O.J. Simpson trial, having been thought to frame the football player because of his hatred towards black people), and during the final scene in Siberia, Iron Man calls Bucky Barnes ""Manchurian Candidate"", referring to the twice-filmed novel, in which American soldiers are thought to be brainwashed.', u'According to the commentary, Cap dropping the shield foreshadows the appearance of the Nomad costume, a short period in the 70s comics, where Cap continued to act as a hero without government sanction.', u""The reason for Thor and the Hulk's absence in the film, is Thor returned to Asgard out of concern for the dark vision that was given to him by Scarlet Witch, and The Hulk vanished. However, their absences in the film are resolved in Thor: Ragnarok (2017), which takes place during this film."", u'During the closing credits the song ""Left Hand Free"" by the band Alt-J plays. This song is significant, due to the fact that Bucky loses his robotic left arm during his fight with Iron Man.', u'The car Tony drives up to the compound in is an 2015 Orange Audi R8.', u""Chris Evans' screentime is five minutes longer than Robert Downey Jr.'s. Evans appears on screen for thirty-nine minutes, while Downey appears for thirty-four minutes."", u'Secretary of State Thaddeus E. ""Thunderbolt"" Ross (William Hurt) is the same General that hunted Bruce Banner, a.k.a. Hulk in The Incredible Hulk (2008) (played by Edward Norton). If you notice, his entire career was placed in the capture of Hulk, which ended in failure (as seen during a pre-credits scene of him drinking and meeting Stark in a bar, in mention of the Avengers Initiative). During this movie, nothing is mentioned of this encounter, nor the meeting between Stark and him at the end. What this means, is that the goverment had full knowledge of the Avengers involvement within all circumstances (outside of Thor, due to Asgard being out of reach).', u""In the narrative behind why Zemo wanted revenge on The Avengers: Zemo's family was killed in the battle of Sokovia, which he blamed The Avengers. Zemo decided to unleash vengeance on The Avengers by framing The Winter Soldier for the murder of T'chaka and find footage of Barnes assassinating Tony Stark's parents, and use it to force Captain America, The Winter Soldier, and Iron Man to fight and kill each other. With the Avengers divided and fighting each other, and with the truth of Stark's parents murder exposed. Zemo would had brought down The Avengers, and had his revenge."", u""One of two films released in the same year which show the parents of a multi-billionaire superhero being murdered. In this movie, Tony Stark's parents are murdered in a flashback. Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016) had a scene where the parents of Bruce Wayne are murdered. Both Bruce Wayne and Tony Stark share a lot of common characteristics. Both are extremely intelligent superheroes with no superhuman powers other that their gadgets and suits. Tony Stark is the CEO of Stark Industries (founded by his father), whereas Bruce Wayne is the CEO of Wayne Corp (founded by his merchant ancestors)."", u""There is an extra scene, in which Barnes decides to go back into suspended animation until something can be done about his conditioning, and Black Panther, who knows the truth about his father's assassination, and that Barnes is innocent, says that he and Barnes are victims of Zemo. This hints the possibilities of there being another Civil War movie, and that now Black Panther knows the truth about his father's death, it's most likely, he will take Captain America's side over Iron Man."", u'All three Captain America movies involve Captain America falling into a body of water: The Arctic Ocean in Captain America: The First Avenger (2011), the Potomac River in Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014), and possibly River Spree in this movie.', u'Stan Lee\'s second cameo playing a delivery man. In this film, he plays a FedEx driver delivering a package to Tony Stark. In Fantastic Four (2005), he played Willie Lumpkin, a USPS mailman who delivered Reed Richards\' (""Mr. Fantastic"") mail to him early in the movie.', u""Rogers' letter to Stark, hints at Captain America and Winter Soldier's return in Avengers: Infinity War (2018)."", u""In Knocked Up (2007), Paul Rudd's character argues with his wife about having snuck out to see Spider-Man 3 (2007). In this movie, Paul Rudd's character (Scott Lang, a.k.a. Ant-Man) fights Spider-Man."", u'This is the second film, featuring Don Cheadle, in which a ""pinch"" is used to set an electromagnetic pulse that interrupts the electrical grid. In Ocean\'s Eleven (2001) Cheadle\'s character, rogue explosives expert Basher Tarr, uses one stolen from a research lab to shut down Las Vegas\' electrical grid while his partners in crime robbed three casinos. In this movie, the villain Zemo ships a pinch to unwitting workers at a substation. The workers unwittingly trigger the pinch, and Zemo, posing as a psychologist sent to examine Bucky Barnes after he was captured in Germany, uses the ensuing blackout to interact with Barnes unobserved, and trigger Barnes\' Soviet ""Winter Soldier"" programming. Nothing good comes of it.', u'Each Marvel superhero movie has a main theme: -Iron Man (2008) and sequels - Weaponry and technology. -The Incredible Hulk (2008) - Mutation and nuclear power. -Captain America: The First Avenger (2011) and sequels - Experimentation and espionage. -Thor (2011) and sequels - Mythology and religion. -Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) - Extra-terrestrial life and cosmic beings. -Ant-Man (2015) - Telepathy and control of animals. -Doctor Strange (2016) - Magic and witchcraft. -The Avengers (2012) - Alien Invasion. -Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015) - Artificial Intelligence.', u'An ""avenger"" is a person who seeks revenge upon those who have wronged themselves or others. Iron Man and Black Panther both seek revenge upon The Winter Soldier. Winter Soldier is framed for the murder of Black Panther\'s father, and Winter Soldier assassinated Iron Man\'s parents at the order of HYDRA.

in filming, before she began to show. To help hide her pregnancy later in filming, three stunt doubles were hired. This caused a lot of confusion amongst the other actors since, according to them, all of the stunt women looked very similar to Johansson. Chris Evans stated that it got to the point where he would say hello, and start a conversation with one of them, only to realize midway, that the person he was talking to wasn't Johansson. Ultimately, some scenes used CGI to hide Johansson's belly."", u'James Spader was Joss Whedon\'s first and only choice for the role of Ultron, because of his ""hypnotic voice that can be eerily calm and compelling, while also being very human and humorous"".', u'Because Ultron was eight to nine feet tall, the five-foot ten-inch James Spader had to wear an antenna-like contraption made out of a thick piece of wire, with two red balls attached to the top, that went up his entire back, and three feet above his head. This was done, so that the cast members that shared scenes with him, would have a reference point for where his eyes would be. The two red balls represented the placement of Ultron\'s eyes. Elizabeth Olsen stated that this was actually distracting, because Spader would be giving an intense performance, and out of instinct, she would look at him, rather than the balls representing his eyes. Much to everyone\'s amusement, whenever this happened, Aaron Taylor-Johnson would yell, ""Red balls! Look at his balls, Lizzie!"" at her in order to get her to look in the right direction.', u""On James Spader's first day on-set, the cast was so impressed by his performance, that they applauded and cheered for him after his first take."", u'Joss Whedon has said that he wanted both Spider-Man and Captain Marvel to appear in the final sequence, but they were unable to, due to timing issues.', u'Aaron Taylor-Johnson was asked to lose weight (muscle mass in particular) because he looked too strong to portray a runner, who is usually trim.', u'Thanos was considered to be the next villain, but Joss Whedon decided against him, in favor of Ultron: ""We have to stay grounded. It\'s part of what makes the Marvel Universe click, their relationship to the real world. Thanos is not out of the mix, but Thanos was never meant to be the next villain. He\'s always been the overlord of villainy and darkness."" Instead, Thanos is scheduled to appear in Avengers: Infinity War (2018) and Untitled Avengers Movie (2019).', u'After this film, and Avengers: Infinity War (2018), Robert Downey, Jr. was going to retire from the Marvel Cinematic Universe. However, he later signed on for Captain America: Civil War (2016).', u'Quicksilver\'s role in the film sparked wide discussion over his place in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The character had been discussed previously as a potential character in both X-Men: Viimeinen kohtaaminen (2006) and The Avengers (2012), but legal complexities resulted in his absence from both. But, in May 2013 Marvel Studios and 20th Century Fox announced a resolution to such issues, and that Quicksilver would appear in Age of Ultron, but only under specific parameters: no reference to his relations to the X-Men or Magneto (the character\'s father), and no reference to Quicksilver\'s membership in the Avengers could be made vice-versa. This went so far, that the character couldn\'t be referred to as a ""mutant"" in any Marvel film. Additionally, other debates between Fox and Marvel, led to two different versions of the same character, both of which are presented in two separate franchises.', u'Ultron recites ""No Strings On Me"", a song from Pinocchio (1940), a Walt Disney film about an inanimate being who gains sentience; Ultron serves as a dark parallel of Pinocchio.', u'It took Joss Whedon a year to convince Aaron Taylor-Johnson to accept the role of Quicksilver. Johnson was concerned over the intensity of the Marvel contracts, the time constraints, and the fact that it was going to be such a large cast. Even after he accepted the role, he was still nervous, but was comforted after he learned that his friend, and Godzilla (2014) co-star, Elizabeth Olsen, would be playing his sister, and would be his filming partner throughout most of the movie.', u'The trailer was viewed thirty-four million times on YouTube in the first twenty-four hours after it was released.

In this film, Ultron is a dormant project developed by Tony Stark, while Pym gets his own separate story in Ant-Man (2015).', u'Joss Whedon cast Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch, because he thought their powers would be cool to use in a film: ""Their powers are very visually interesting. One of the problems I had on the first one, was everybody basically had punchy powers. Quicksilver\'s got super-speed, Scarlet Witch can weave spells, and a little telekinesis, get inside your head. That\'s good stuff they can do, that will help keep it fresh.""', u'Joss Whedon claimed that juggling all the characters in the film was ""a nightmare"": ""They\'re very disparate characters. The joy of the Avengers is they really don\'t belong in the same room. It\'s not like the X-Men, who are all tortured by the same thing, and have similar costumes. These guys are just all over the place, and so it\'s tough."" He was so exhausted with working on this film, that he decided not to direct the sequels Avengers: Infinity War (2018) and Untitled Avengers Movie (2019).', u'Industrial Light & Magic developed a new motion-capture system for the film, called ""Muse"", to better capture the actor\'s facial and body movements, and combine different takes of the same performance, with regards to Ultron and the Hulk. Andy Serkis (who also has the on-screen role of Ulysses Klaus) was brought on-board to contribute towards Muse\'s design and improvement. One major benefit of this work for the actor, was that in this film, Mark Ruffalo was able to do some of his Mo-Cap performance alongside his fellow cast members on-set, and on-location, as opposed to, in the first films, where he was working separately from the others. It furthermore reduced the amount of specific facial Mo-Cap sections, as they now were able to do both body and face simultaneously. (Source: The Graham Norton Show interview).', u'When Tony Stark goes to upload his new A.I. partner, F.R.I.D.A.Y. There is another drive labeled JOCASTA. JOCASTA, in the comics, was an A.I. created by Ultron, and her mind and body were modeled after Janet Van Dyne (The Wasp). She would eventually turn against Ultron, and join the Avengers.', u'According to Mark Ruffalo, his portrayal of the Hulk is inspired by Peter David\'s Hulk comics, where the Hulk and Bruce Banner were a split personality case: ""There\'s a very cool thing happening in the film: Hulk is as afraid of Banner, as Banner is afraid of Hulk. Both of these guys are obviously the same guy, and they have to come to peace somehow with each other, and this confrontation is building across this film.""', u'""Marvel Ultimates"" comic is famous for featuring a controversial incestuous storyline between Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch. According to Elizabeth Olsen, while this particular aspect would not be overtly present in the film, she and Aaron Taylor-Johnson ""played around"" with certain parts of it: ""Every time you see an image of them, they\'re always holding each other\'s hand and looking over each other\'s shoulder. They\'re always so close, it\'s almost uncomfortable. Aaron and I have been playing a little bit with those kinds of images just for ourselves.""', u'James Spader described Ultron as self-absorbed and immature: ""He sees the world from a very strange, biblical point of view, because he\'s brand new, he\'s very young. He\'s immature, and yet has knowledge of comprehensive, broad history and precedent, and he has created in a very short period of time, a rather skewed worldview.""', u'Hugh Jackman, who plays Wolverine in the X-Men films, has expressed an interest to play Wolverine in an Avengers sequel, despite the rights issues between Marvel and Fox over the X-Men. Jackman stated that he wanted to see Wolverine battle Iron Man. Rumors have spread recently, however, that Fox and Marvel met to discuss an unknown deal. This could potentially involve an agreement, similar to that between Sony and Marvel, which gives Marvel the ability to include Spider-Man in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Wolverine first appeared in the comics, as an enemy of the Hulk. During the Avengers vs. X-men comic book event, he was rivaled with Captain America.', u'The scene where Ultron commands his drones to fly down and latch themselves onto the truck in Seoul, took 360 days to complete. It was handled by only one animator, who upon completion of the scene, received a party, and a bottle of champagne for his efforts.', u""Cameo (Stan Lee): A Veteran at the Avengers' party, who takes a drink of Thor's ale.

Additionally, Hemsworth and Cobie Smulders (Maria Hill) have both admitted to not knowing who Ultron is."", u'Lou Ferrigno contributed to the voice of the Hulk in this film. He has played the Hulk in almost every live-action version since 1978: he played the Hulk in The Incredible Hulk (1978), and its subsequent three television specials, and he voiced the Hulk in the big-screen The Incredible Hulk (2008), in which he also played security guard. He also played a security guard in Hulk (2003). He has also voiced the Hulk in various animated productions.', u""Bruce Banner's creation that houses the extra Hulkbuster parts, Veronica, is named that, as an in-joke, based on the Archie comics.

Lee's experience writing for Timely Comics (before it became Marvel) was put to use instead, for the Army's medical division, thinking up slogans for posters about preventing the spread of venereal diseases that were drawn by Theodore Geisel a.k.a. Dr. Seuss."", u'The prelude to this film is on the mid-credits scene of Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014).', u'In comics, Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver are born mutants. In this movie, they got their powers due to experimentation of HYDRA on them. This change has to do with the fact that 20th Century Fox holds the rights to the X-Men films, and the whole mutant concept. Therefore this change was intended to disassociate the film from the X-Men film franchise, to avoid legal issues.', u'When Elizabeth Olsen and Aaron Taylor-Johnson learned that their roles Wanda and Pietro Maximoff would be based on their ""Marvel Ultimates"" version, they both read and studied every single issue, in order to prepare for the role.', u'The film was named after a 2013 Marvel comic series ""Age of Ultron"". However, Kevin Feige explained that that particular comic would not be used as a storyline: ""We came up with a few titles, but every month a new comic book appears, and \'Age Of Ultron\' is a great title. We had a few other \'Of Ultrons\', but that was the best one.

His sister really is his guidance, emotionally she\'s the one who looks after him, and vice-versa. He\'s very overprotective physically, he doesn\'t want anyone touching her.""', u'Elizabeth Olsen and Aaron Taylor-Johnson consulted each other, before accepting the roles of Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver. The two became friends while filming Godzilla (2014), and as soon as they found out that both had offers, they called each other to check if the other was doing it, before signing on.', u'Aaron Taylor-Johnson\'s favorite superhero amongst the Avengers is Chris Hemsworth. Taylor-Johnson was impressed by Hemsworth, saying, ""The only one who has an otherworldly superhero physique is Hemsworth. The size of his arms, is like the size of my thighs. Just to be an actor and transform your physique and body to that level, he\'s essentially a god. Everyone in the cast is charming and brilliant, but you look around the room and you go \'that guy is definitely the superhero.\'""', u""Quicksilver's running visual effects were created by first filming with an ultra-high-speed camera, and then filming Aaron Taylor-Johnson running in the same scene at regular speed, and then digitally splicing the two scenes together."", u'Elizabeth Olsen worked with a dance choreographer to make her movements more graceful for action sequences.', u'According to Aaron Taylor-Johnson, no one realized that no plans for a wrap-party had been made, until the last day of filming. As a result, Joss Whedon gathered the cast at the end of the day, and made them walk around the small Italian town, in which they were filming, while it snowed heavily, until he found an appropriate place for a party. They finally found a small club, and the cast, along with Whedon, danced until four in the morning.', u'Joss Whedon described this film as ""Smaller. More personal. More painful.

As Quicksilver is the first major protagonist to die in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, controversy has sparked about how he could have easily avoided such a fate. The reason Quicksilver did not do the same as his X-Men counterpart (and survive the attack) is partially because of the licensing agreement between Marvel and Fox, as no references to Quicksilver\'s affiliation with the X-Men could be made in a Marvel movie, and no references to his affiliation with the Avengers could be made in an X-Men movie. The other reason being that the Screenwriters for this movie, purposely shrank the scope of Quicksilver\'s powers, significantly limiting his capabilities, which also served to distinguish him from his X-Men doppelganger.', u'Foreshadowing Quicksilver\'s death, Captain America tells Hawkeye, Scarlet Witch, and Quicksilver that, ""If you get hurt, hurt \'em back, if you get killed, walk it off."" While Cap is saying all this, they switch between showing the three characters, to whom he\'s talking. When he says the line ""if you get killed, walk it off"", Quicksilver is shown.', u'At the end of the film, Natasha is sent a video of Barton\'s son wearing a ""Nathaniel Pietro Barton"" onesie. This shows he is named after Natasha (Black Widow) and Pietro Maximoff (Quicksilver), the two people who saved his life.', u""In the comics, Vision was created by Ultron, to kill the Avengers. In this movie, he's created by Ultron, given a mind, and base set of ideals by Bruce Banner and Tony Stark, and later given life by Thor to aid the Avengers."", u""The band that Steve Rogers sees in his hallucination is called The Roy Thomas Players. Roy Thomas was Marvel's Editor-in-Chief during the 1970s, succeeding Stan Lee. This homage seems a bit meager, considering that Thomas co-created (with artist John Buscema) both Ultron and the Vision, during his long and influential writing stint on the Avengers comic (1966-1972)."", u'First full movie since Iron Man (2008) that Tony Stark has not had an arc reactor in his chest (the arc reactor had been removed by the time of the epilogue scene in Iron Man 3 (2013), when Tony visits the rubble of his house).', u'In the mid-credits scene, where Thanos (Josh Brolin) takes an Infinity Gauntlet in his left hand, and it says ""Fine, I\'ll do it myself"". This glove is the true Infinity Gauntlet. In the comic published in 1990, Thanos used the Gauntlet to reunite the six Gems of Infinity, in order to increase his powers, after receiving the mission to annihilate half of the population of the entire universe, which was ordered by Mistress Death (the personification of death in the Marvel Universe). While this is the Gauntlet that Thanos will be using, two Gauntlets exist in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, including the one shown in the vault in Thor (2011).', u""During Ultron's rage about being compared to Tony Stark, the disks and plates that make up his cheeks seem to disappear, and then move back into position when he is confronted by Thor, Captain America, and Iron Man. It is possible that when angered, these cheek plates retract, to allow his jaw more articulation, mainly for expressing speech, and possibly as a nod to the open-mouthed face of Ultron in the comics."", u'Long before the release of the movie, Joss Whedon said that Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch would not be immediate allies of The Avengers.', u'All four of the Avengers to have solo films get held by the throat in this movie. Iron Man is choked by Thor, Hulk is choked by Iron Man, and Thor and Captain America get choked by Ultron.', u'The Mark 45, Iron Man used during the final battle, is rumored to be the famous Heroic Age, or The Bleeding Edge Armor, that he used mainly in the comics.', u'The Lego sets for the film have spoiled some parts of the movie like the Hulkbuster Lego set, in which Scarlet Witch has caused the Hulk to rampage.', u""When Iron Man, Vision, and Thor are shooting thunder and lasers at Ultron, Ultron's metallic head starts to heat up, becoming red, and making his eyes glow, which is a nod to the comic book look of Ultron."", u'In order for Iron Man to use his Mark 44 (Hulkbuster), a satellite that Iron Man calls ""Veronica"", would launch a pod containing the Hulkbuster Armor, deploying itself around Iron Man. Another pod is deployed, and follows the Hulkbuster during its battles. The floating and following pod contains spare and extra parts, in order to replace certain damaged or missing parts the Hulkbuster might incur.', u""In the comics and cartoons, Ultron created The Vision to aid him in defeating The Avengers. In this movie, The Vision was supposed to be Ultron's next form, as opposed to his most powerful minion."", u""The Vision's creation in this film, shares many parallels with Frankenstein's monster, such as the controversy of his creation, and the lightning Thor calls down to finish the process, and bring him to life."", u'Even though the tag line for The Avengers is ""Avengers Assemble"", the word assemble was never used in this movie. It is teased at the end of the movie, when Captain America looks at the new Avengers and says, ""Avengers"" but gets cut off by a black screen.', u'Ultron\'s very first body (dubbed Ultron Mark 1) resembles a very worn out, heavily damaged endoskeletal Iron Legion drone. However, his limbs appear very asymmetrical. This is because Ultron actually created that first body from the disassembled Iron Legion Drone 03, as well as using other parts, which accounts for the patchwork-esque look. Strangely enough, the robotic bodies seen earlier on before the title card, that later become Ultron\'s drones, share this same, asymmetrical aesthetic. In fact, the only one of Ultron\'s forms to sport a symmetrical appearance, is the body he has, by the time he meets Wanda and Pietro Maximoff in Sokovia, dubbed ""Ultron Prime"".', u'In the end of the movie, we can see the new Avengers: Scarlet Witch, Vision, Falcon, and War Machine.', u'Though each and every one of Ultron\'s forms throughout the film were named, they are never explicitly referred to as such. Ultron\'s mangled, broken body is never referred to as ""Ultron Mark 1"", his second body is never referred to as ""Ultron Prime"", his Vibranium-plated Prime body is never referred to as ""Ultimate Ultron"", and his drones are never referred to as ""Ultron Sentries"".', u""During Thor's vision of the Infinity Stones, that have appeared in the Marvel Universe, they line up in their crystal forms in front of a yellow nebula that bears a striking resemblance to the Infinity Gauntlet."", u""The Ultron Sentries are heavily based on Ultron's comic book variation. Their eyes and mouth glow blue, but when Ultron takes control of its body, their eyes turn red, closely resembling Ultron's comic book counterpart."", u'Both this film, and Thor (2011), have the hammer\'s ""worthiness"" as a fairly significant contribution to the plot. Only Thor can wield Mjollnir (the hammer) in Thor, while Thor and The Vision can wield it in this film. However, even though the worthiness is a large part of the hammer\'s story and involvement, in Thor: The Dark World (2013), it is hung on a coat hook and left. This technically deems the coat hook as ""worthy"", seeing as it is not on the floor when Thor goes to pick it up, unlike Quicksilver, who attempts holding it while running and is pulled backward by its sheer weight (and the fact he is not worthy).', u""In the second trailer, viewers might notice Black Widow carrying two rifles. Apparently, when the movie was released, she didn't wield those two rifles. Only one rifle was used by Bruce Banner, a.k.a. Hulk, in order to help Black Widow escape from her prison cell."", u'After the party in the Avengers\' tower, each Avenger, excluding Black Widow, try to lift the Mj\xf6lnir. According to Marvel Comics, on the hammer is written: ""Whosoever holds this hammer, if he be worthy, shall possess the power of Thor"", making Tony Stark\'s ""fingerprint"" theory somewhat correct.', u'When Quicksilver is shot by Ultron, he has about eight gunshot wounds all over his body. When he falls down next to Hawkeye, you can only see three gunshot wounds - one in the middle of his chest, one on his left arm, and one on his right leg.', u'Prior to the release of the film, people were wondering why the Hulk and Iron Man (in Hulkbuster armor) were fighting. One popular theory is that they were simply sparring to see who was stronger. Of course, in the final film, they were fighting because Scarlet Witch manipulated Hulk.', u'Originally, Quicksilver was never going to die. Also, we would have been introduced to Spider-Man and Captain Marvel in the end, with the New Avengers. However, they stuck with the scene in the film.', u'Throughout the whole movie, the Hulkbuster is referred to as ""Veronica"", and it is only mentioned three times. Once, when Tony was talking to Banner about creating Ultron. Once, after all of the team got mind-tricked by Scarlet Witch, and once mid-fight with the Hulk, when Tony asked for a hand.', u'While on the table, recovering from his injury, Hawkeye says he will be made of plastic, the doctor says, ""No Mr. Barton, it\'s made of you, even your own girlfriend won\'t know the difference"". He says ""I don\'t have a girlfriend"". Later on in the movie, we meet his wife.']","[u'USA::13 April 2015 (Los Angeles, California)\n (premiere)', u'Belgium::22 April 2015', u'Switzerland::22 April 2015 (French speaking region)', u'Switzerland::22 April 2015 (Italian speaking region)', u'Finland::22 April 2015', u'France::22 April 2015', u'Indonesia::22 April 2015', u'Italy::22 April 2015', u'Netherlands::22 April 2015', u'Norway::22 April 2015', u'Philippines::22 April 2015', u'Sweden::22 April 2015', u'Taiwan::22 April 2015', u'Albania::23 April 2015', u'Argentina::23 April 2015', u'Austria::23 April 2015', u'Australia::23 April 2015', u'Azerbaijan::23 April 2015', u'Brazil::23 April 2015', u'Belarus::23 April 2015', u'Switzerland::23 April 2015 (German speaking region)', u'Germany::23 April 2015', u'Denmark::23 April 2015', u'UK::23 April 2015', u'Georgia::23 April 2015', u'Hong Kong::23 April 2015', u'Ireland::23 April 2015', u'Israel::23 April 2015', u'Iceland::23 April 2015', u'South Korea::23 April 2015', u'Kazakhstan::23 April 2015', u'New Zealand::23 April 2015', u'Romania::23 April 2015', u'Russia::23 April 2015', u'Singapore::23 April 2015', u'Ukraine::23 April 2015', u'Bulgaria::24 April 2015', u'India::24 April 2015', u'Vietnam::24 April 2015', u'South Africa::24 April 2015', u'Egypt::29 April 2015', u'Spain::29 April 2015', u'Kuwait::29 April 2015', u'Portugal::29 April 2015', u'Trinidad and Tobago::29 April 2015', u'United Arab Emirates::30 April 2015', u'Bosnia and Herzegovina::30 April 2015', u'Chile::30 April 2015', u'Czech Republic::30 April 2015', u'Ecuador::30 April 2015', u'Greece::30 April 2015', u'Croatia::30 April 2015', u'Iraq::30 April 2015', u'Republic of Macedonia::30 April 2015', u'Mexico::30 April 2015', u'Malaysia::30 April 2015', u'Panama::30 April 2015', u'Peru::30 April 2015', u'Serbia::30 April 2015', u'Slovakia::30 April 2015', u'Thailand::30 April 2015', u'Bangladesh::1 May 2015', u'Bahamas::1 May 2015', u'Canada::1 May 2015', u'Colombia::1 May 2015', u'Cyprus::1 May 2015', u'Estonia::1 May 2015', u'Ethiopia::1 May 2015', u'Cambodia::1 May 2015', u'Sri Lanka::1 May 2015', u'Lithuania::1 May 2015', u'Latvia::1 May 2015', u'Pakistan::1 May 2015', u'Turkey::1 May 2015', u'USA::1 May 2015', u'Venezuela::1 May 2015', u'Hungary::7 May 2015', u'Poland::7 May 2015', u'China::12 May 2015', u'Japan::23 June 2015 (Tokyo)\n (premiere)', u'Japan::4 July 2015']",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The eagle head can actually be seen at the foot of the conference round table, at the end of the film, when repairs are being made.', u'Robert Downey Jr. initially pushed Joss Whedon to make Tony Stark the lead: ""I said, I need to be in the opening sequence, Tony needs to drive this thing.

Technically, both Eric Bana and Edward Norton had done motion-capture work for their respective Hulks, but Ruffalo is the first actor to perform the Hulk live on-set via performance capture. What is most certainly a confirmed ""first"" for Ruffalo\'s Hulk, however, is clearly defined chest hair (of which Ruffalo has plenty). That has absolutely never been done before in any portrayal of the Hulk, whether it be live, animated, or drawn.', u""As of 2013, this is the highest grossing film of all time not directed by James Cameron (Avengers is third under Titanic (1997)'s second place and Avatar (2009)'s first)."", u'(at around 1h 40 mins) Tony Stark describes his group as ""Earth\'s mightiest heroes, that kind of thing.""

Robert Downey, Jr. was forty-six when this movie was released.', u'At the end of the train sequence, Watson says to Holmes, ""Once more unto the breach"". This is a line from a speech in Henry V by William Shakespeare. Much later in the play\'s speech, Henry V also exclaims, ""The game is afoot"", which Holmes used as a catchphrase in Sir Arthur Conan Doyle\'s stories.', u'At the beginning, when Watson is typing, the camera pans over typed excerpts from Sir Arthur Conan Doyle\'s stories, including ""The Blue Carbuncle"" and ""A Study in Scarlet"".', u""The series of numbers on Moriarty's blackboard (and seen again briefly during the notebook decoding sequence towards the end), is Pascal's triangle with the shallow diagonals marked, the sums of which form the Fibonacci sequence."", u'The bombmaker, Claude Ravache (Thierry Neuvic), was inspired by a real anarchist, Fran\xe7ois Claudius Koenigstein Ravachol, who was active until his execution in 1892.', u'Brad Pitt, Gary Oldman, Daniel Day-Lewis, Sean Penn, and Javier Bardem were considered to play Professor Moriarty.', u'Sophie Marceau, Audrey Tautou, Pen\xe9lope Cruz, Juliette Binoche, Virginie Ledoyen, Eva Green, Marion Cotillard, and C\xe9cile De France were considered to play Sim before Noomi Rapace was cast.', u""The advertisement for Lazenby's Soup Squares on the back of Moriarty's newspaper is for a real product of that era."", u'Stephen Fry (Mycroft Holmes) and Jared Harris (Professor Moriarty) share the same birthday.', u'Stephen Fry also appear in The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug (2013) and The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies (2014).

However, in response to overwhelming public demand, Doyle wrote another story and resurrected Holmes.', u'In Holmes\' final struggle with Moriarty, he uses a two-handed clasp to immobilize Moriarty before going over the falls.

Holmes is reluctant to do so. In the original stories by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Mary Morstan is introduced as a client (in the novel ""The Sign of Four""). She and Watson fall in love while he assists Holmes in her case, and he proposes to her at the end of the novel.', u'In the stories, Holmes is described to be an expert in Baritsu. In the film, however, the martial art that Holmes used is the Wing-Chun Kung Fu (famously used by Ip Man Yee and Bruce Lee). Robert Downey, Jr. is a practitioner of the art in real-life, and the fight scene between him and David Garrick at Punch Bowl Pit was coordinated with the help of his trainer.', u""Despite Moriarty's obsession with the Blackwood Device, and saying how it is crucial to his plans, it plays absolutely no important part in Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows (2011)."", u'After examining Lord Blackwood\'s coffin, the line that Holmes and Watson deliver in unison, ""The game\'s afoot; follow your spirit: and upon this charge, cry--God for Harry! England and Saint George!"" is from William Shakespeare\'s play Henry V.', u'The film contains numerous references and allusions to the Sir Arthur Conan Doyle novels and stories. Including: ""The game is afoot."" (""The Abbey Grange"", as well as the original source of the phrase, William Shakespeare\'s ""Henry V""); ""Because I was looking for it."" (""Silver Blaze""); ""You have the grand gift of silence, Watson. It makes you quite invaluable as a companion."" (""The Man with the Twisted Lip""); ""Crime is common, logic is rare.""

Five is also the number of women that the bulk of historians agree were murdered by Jack the Ripper (additional victims are disputed).', u'Although Irene Adler plays a large role in the movie (and works of fiction by ""Baker Street irregulars""), she only appears in one Sir Arthur Conan Doyle story, ""A Scandal in Bohemia"", briefly referenced in the movie. Holmes retains the portrait of Irene Adler acquired for his services in that story and also once refers to her as ""the woman"" as he does in the latter story.', u'Robert Downey, Jr. read many Sherlock Holmes stories and watched The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (1984) in order to learn more about the character.', u'When Sherlock says ""Now that you\'re sitting comfortably, I shall begin."" to begin explaining Blackwood\'s plot, it is a reference to a BBC children\'s radio program from the 1950s, Listen With Mother, which was famous for its opening line ""Are you sitting comfortably? Then I\'ll begin.""', u'The story ""The Adventure of the Musgrave Ritual"" mentions that Holmes practiced shooting his pistol by putting VR (Victoria Regina) on his wall with bullet holes. In the movie, Holmes shoots VR in the wall in his room with a gun.', u'The scene in which Holmes and Watson make a series of deductions from a dead man\'s watch closely mirrors a similar sequence in ""The Sign of the Four"" (as does Holmes\' ability to follow the carriage\'s path whilst blindfolded), in which Holmes uses nearly identical observations (scratches around the watch\'s keyhole, pawnbroker\'s marks on the inside of the case) to deduce information from a watch belonging to Watson\'s late brother. Holmes\'s passing reference to locking Watson\'s checkbook in his desk parallels a similar statement in ""The Adventure of the Dancing Men"", which commentators such as William S. Baring-Gould have taken to mean that Watson had a gambling problem, an interpretation that the film adopts. Holmes also uses a riding crop as a weapon throughout the film, as he does in ""A Case of Identity"". In the ""Six Napoleons"", it is described as his ""favorite weapon"".', u'The four symbols, to which are referred, in the movie, the Man, the Lion, the Ox, and the Eagle, are also attributed to the four Gospels of the Christian Bible: Matthew (Man, the humanity of Christ), Mark (Lion, for courage and for action), Luke (Ox, for strength and perseverance), and John (Eagle, for clarity of sight and for divinity).', u'The first Sherlock Holmes film to reach U.S. movie theaters in over twenty years, since the 1988 comedy Without a Clue (1988) with Michael Caine as Reginald Kincaid/""Sherlock Holmes"".', u'Lord Blackwood\'s ""final"" words, ""Death is only the beginning"", are the same words that were carved in Imhotep\'s sarcophagus in The Mummy (1999).', u'The bare-knuckle fight between Holmes and McMurdo references the Holmes story ""The Sign of Four"".

Don\'t you remember that amateur who fought three rounds with you at Alison\'s rooms on the night of your benefit four years back?""', u'Mary asks Watson if she could read his journals of his adventures with Sherlock Holmes. Of the sixty Sir Arthur Conan Doyle-penned stories of Sherlock Holmes, all but four have Watson serving as the narrator. Of these two are narrated by Holmes (""Blanched Soldier"" and ""Lion\'s Mane""), and two by an omniscient narrator (""Marazin Stone"" and ""His Last Bow."")', u""Before the scene where Sherlock Holmes reenacts the black magic ceremony, we see a brief shot of an inn called The Punch Bowl. The Punch Bowl is the name of Guy Ritchie's pub in Mayfair, London."", u""The name of Holmes and Watson's English bulldog is Gladstone.

The first is the name of the primary antagonist, Lord Blackwood, which parallels that of ""Mazarin Stone"" villain Count Negretto Sylvius (Negretto is Italian for black, and Sylvius is Latin for woods). (As Holmes scholar W. W. Roberts notes, this is ""presumably a private joke at the expense of Blackwood\'s Magazine, long and unavailingly courted by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle in the 1880s."") Another common detail is the Crown Diamond, an alternate name for the Mazarin Stone, which hangs around Irene Adler\'s neck in the film. ""The Mazarin Stone"" is also the first story to mention that the 221B Baker Street apartment had multiple exits and a waiting room. The extra exit, which was through the bedroom, is employed by Holmes to follow Irene early in the film.', u'Colin Farrell was in talks to play Watson, before Jude Law was cast.', u'Sam Worthington was considered for the role of Watson.', u'After Holmes recreates the ritual on his own, as he describes it to Watson and Irene Adler, he holds his spotted stick to his forehead for a few seconds. This is a reference to the story ""The Speckled Band"", in which a speckled snake wraps itself around the villain\'s head and bites him.', u'Jude Law previously appeared in the Granada television series The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes (1991), in The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes: Shoscombe Old Place (1991).', u'The song that plays from 1:03 to the end on the second trailer is a piece called ""Unstoppable"" by the group E.S.

This is a coincidence as Clive Russel goes on to play 'The Blackfish' in HBO's Game of Thrones."", u'The Celtic music playing during the ""Meat and Potatoes"" fight scene is actually the AC/DC song Thunderstruck. It stops when they are in the boat area.', u'Robert Downey, Jr. and Jude Law have worked with other actors who played Holmes and Watson. Downey appears in Avengers: Infinity War (2018) with Benedict Cumberbatch, Captain America: Civil War (2016) with Martin Freeman, Iron Man 3 (2013) with Sir Ben Kingsley, and The Judge (2014) with Robert Duvall. Law appeared on the 1980s Sherlock Holmes series that starred Jeremy Brett as Sherlock, and David Burke and Edward Hardwicke as Watson; Breaking and Entering (2006) with Martin Freeman, A.I. Artificial Intelligence (2001) with Sir Ben Kingsley; and Hugo (2011) with both Kingsley and Sir Christopher Lee.

The first was a burial crime scene (Earth), second was drowning (water), third was immolation (fire), and fourth was poison gas (air).', u'Guy Ritchie has stated in interviews that he is a fan (and a practitioner) of Brazilian Jiu-jitsu, made popular in mixed martial arts. Towards the end of the movie, Holmes and Watson fight Dredger, and finally manage to subdue him with an arm-bar and a modified rear naked choke, both popular Brazilian Jiu-jitsu submissions.', u'In the newspaper with the headline ""London In Terror: Blackwood Lives and the Devil Walks With Him"", handed by Lestrade to Holmes when Holmes is bailed out, the names of the five women who were Blackwood\'s first five victims are revealed. They are: Susan Willis, Margaret Coile, June Gray, Mary Wilson, and Sarah Moss. The woman, on whose murder Holmes intervened, is revealed to be named as Beatrice Church.', u'All events take place in the year 1891. After Holmes and Watson are released from custody following the events in the shipyard, Inspector Lestrade hands a newspaper (""The National Police Gazette"") over to Holmes. The title on the newspaper is ""London In Terror"", and the date is Friday, November 19, 1891, but oddly the first newspaper, foretelling Blackwoods hanging, given to Holmes by Watson in his apartment is dated Novemeber 13, 1890. This sets the story during the period when, in the original Sir Arthur Conan Doyle stories, Holmes was believed dead. According to ""The Final Problem"", Holmes and Professor Moriarty apparently plunged to their deaths over the Reichenbach Falls in May 1891. Holmes did not reveal he had survived until the spring of 1894, as described in ""The Adventure of the Empty House"".', u'When Sherlock and Watson visit Blackwood\'s grave, Sherlock says ""And on the third day..."" - a reference to Jesus as he rose from the dead on the third day.']","[u'UK::14 December 2009 (London)\n (premiere)', u'Bahrain::24 December 2009', u'Hong Kong::24 December 2009', u'Croatia::24 December 2009', u'South Korea::24 December 2009', u'Kuwait::24 December 2009', u'Malaysia::24 December 2009', u'Portugal::24 December 2009', u'Singapore::24 December 2009', u'Thailand::24 December 2009', u'Canada::25 December 2009', u'Switzerland::25 December 2009 (Italian speaking region)', u'Denmark::25 December 2009', u'Israel::25 December 2009', u'Italy::25 December 2009', u'Latvia::25 December 2009', u'USA::25 December 2009', u'Australia::26 December 2009', u'UK::26 December 2009', u'Ireland::26 December 2009', u'Iceland::26 December 2009', u'Norway::26 December 2009', u'New Zealand::26 December 2009', u'Indonesia::27 December 2009', u'Egypt::30 December 2009', u'Kazakhstan::31 December 2009', u'Russia::31 December 2009', u'Ukraine::31 December 2009', u'Bulgaria::1 January 2010', u'Lithuania::1 January 2010', u'Mexico::1 January 2010', u'Panama::1 January 2010', u'Romania::1 January 2010', u'Sweden::1 January 2010', u'Belgium::6 January 2010', u'Czech Republic::7 January 2010', u'Hungary::7 January 2010', u'Netherlands::7 January 2010', u'Peru::7 January 2010', u'Slovenia::7 January 2010', u'Brazil::8 January 2010', u'Estonia::8 January 2010', u'India::8 January 2010', u'Philippines::8 January 2010', u'Argentina::11 January 2010 (Buenos Aires)\n (premiere)', u'Argentina::14 January 2010', u'Greece::14 January 2010', u'Spain::15 January 2010', u'Poland::15 January 2010', u'Turkey::15 January 2010', u'Finland::22 January 2010', u'Switzerland::28 January 2010 (German speaking region)', u'Germany::28 January 2010', u'Syria::28 January 2010', u'Austria::29 January 2010', u'Switzerland::3 February 2010 (French speaking region)', u'France::3 February 2010', u'China::25 February 2010', u'Japan::28 February 2010 (Yubari International Fantastic Film Festival)', u'Japan::12 March 2010', u'Vietnam::31 December 2012']",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

However, the word is used once when Samuel Sterns warns Blonsky that the mix of Banner\'s mutated DNA with Blonsky\'s injection ""could be... an abomination.""', u'A scene where a hopeless Bruce Banner arrives at the Arctic to commit suicide was featured in the trailer, but was deemed too sensitive for young viewers, and was removed from the film.', u'In the comics, Emil Blonsky takes on a scaly reptilian appearance, becoming the Abomination. Louis Leterrier felt that while that was cool, it made no sense, considering there was no reptile mix in his origin. So, in this film, Blonsky\'s appearance is redefined substantially, to have his skin, muscles, and bones exaggerated, and sticking out all over his body. Leterrier describes Blonsky as ""an uber-human, just like the Hulk, but a human who was injected with something in the wrong places, and these places are growing differently."" The Visual Effects Artists think of Blonsky as ""a guy who transforms, but is not used to having these new properties.

Several Toronto icons are visible, most notably the ""spinning disc"" sign for Sam the Record Man, and the marquee of the Zanzibar Tavern.', u""The Hulk's origin in this film is a combination of the Marvel Ultimates comics (experimenting on Captain America's super-soldier serum) and The Incredible Hulk (1978) (over-exposure to gamma radiation in an experiment). Even the equipment seen is a close match to that used in the television series, right down to the light sliding over Banner's face."", u'Tim Roth signed on the film, because he was a fan of The Incredible Hulk (1978), as well as to please his comic book fan sons. On-set, he constantly asked whether this would ""be a cool shot"", in which his kids to see him. He thoroughly enjoyed playing Blonsky, but found it difficult, since to portray Blonsky\'s over-the-hill state, he could not work out, but he hired a personal trainer to assist him in motion-capturing the Abomination\'s movements.', u'This is the fourth film where Edward Norton plays a character with an alter ego, following Primal Fear (1996), Fight Club (1999), and The Score (2001).', u'In the Bruce Jones Hulk comics, Betty Ross aided Bruce Banner, as a shadowy contact under the alias ""Mr. Blue"". Mr. Blue appears in this film, but is revealed to be Samuel Sterns. The title ""Mr. Blue"" is also a possible (though unlikely) reference to Tim Roth\'s crime film Reservoir Dogs (1992), which featured Roth as Mr. Orange, and a Mr. Blue portrayed by Edward Bunker.', u'at around 1h 40 mins) Toward the end of the film, when Banner is hiding out on Canada, he receives a package addressed to David B. In the early Hulk issues, Banner\'s name evolved from David Banner, to Bob Banner, and finally settled at Bruce Banner. When the changes were pointed out in the letter columns, Marvel (and it may have been Stan Lee) ""explained"" the changes saying that his full name was something like David Bob Bruce Banner, and he chose to go by Bruce.', u'In this film , Bruce (Edward Norton) learns to control his anger partially through martial arts training. The martial arts instructor who (with Bruce\'s permission) slaps him a couple times during training, is played by renowned Brazilian Jiu-jitsu Grandmaster Rickson Gracie, whose family were the founders of Brazilian Jiu-jitsu.

Additionally, the origin of Happy\'s nickname in the comics, is that he was a former professional boxer who earned that nickname, due to his reputation of never fighting back.', u""Rock guitarist Tom Morello assisted Ramin Djawadi in composing the film's soundtrack.

This was particularly due to Marvel using their characters as collateral when they received a five hundred twenty-five million dollar, seven year deal, called a non-recourse debt facility, allowing them to make original films based on their properties. Marvel wanted to have complete creative control over their characters, build a film library, and greater profit potential than the deals they've inked with other studios owning the film rights to their characters. Marvel also changed its name to Marvel Entertainment, Incorporated, to establish a Hollywood presence. If the film didn't succeed, Marvel would've lost the intellectual property rights to their library."", u'When designing Tony Stark\'s house, the guideline the designers were given was to make it more ""grease monkey"" (inventor and mechanic) than futuristic, in order to keep the film realistic.

Iron Man was also animated to take off slowly and land quickly, to make those movements more realistic."", u'The leader of the Ten Rings is named Raza, after a Marvel Comics character. However, the comic version of Raza is not an enemy of Iron Man, but an alien cyborg, who is a member of the space pirate gang known as the Starjammers. The only similarity they share, is their facial disfigurement. In the comics, Raza has implants on the left side of his face, while in the film, Raza is scarred on the right side of his face.', u""According to Ramin Djawadi, Tony Stark's different moods, as performed by Robert Downey Jr., was the inspiration for the Iron Man scores in the film."", u'According to the January 2012 Air & Space Magazine, Tony Starks\'s character was also inspired by South African born SpaceX (and PayPal co-founder), Elon Musk.

Two years later, it hadn't moved on so Tom Cruise tried to kickstart a production, to the extent of commissioning a script by Stan Lee and Jeff Vintar. Jeffrey Caine then did a polish on the screenplay. Still nothing. In 1999, Quentin Tarantino was approached to see if he could move things along but that too came to nothing.

However, the Audi R8 was so well-built, that it refused to flip, despite repeated crashes and the roof wouldn't split the way Jon Favreau wanted it to, because the car's frame was so tough. As a result, the whole final fight sequence was re-written. The filmmakers were so impressed by the toughness of the car, that it was decided that the convertible version was to be featured in Iron Man 2 (2010)."", u'Brian Michael Bendis had written three pages of dialogue for the Nick Fury scene, out of which the filmmakers chose the best lines. To keep it a secret, the scene was filmed with a skeleton crew, and was omitted from all previews of the film, which thus maintained the mystery and surprise, and kept fans speculative and interested. It conclusively appeared in the final cut as a post-credits scene.', u'In the Ultimate Marvel Comics series, the character of Nick Fury is portrayed as African-American, with his look and personality tailored after Samuel L. Jackson, all carried out with Jackson\'s explicit permission. During one of the Ultimate Avengers issues, while discussing the possibility of a movie being made about them, and which actors would play which heroes, Nick Fury comments that nobody else but Samuel L. Jackson could play him. Jackson, himself a comic book fan, plays Fury in this film.

Rhodey dons this suit in Iron Man 2 (2010), becoming War Machine.', u'According to Jeff Bridges, Obadiah Stane was originally supposed to survive the final battle against Tony, with the heroes opening up his destroyed suit to find that there was no corpse inside. Presumably this would have poised Stane to return for future movies.', u'at around 1h 55 mins) Shortly into the credits sequence, there is an animation of the Ten Rings logo. This refers to the terrorist group that captures Tony Stark early in the film, but is not actually acknowledged. It is, however, commonly acknowledged in Iron Man 3 (2013).', u""According to Jon Favreau, it was difficult to find a proper opponent for Iron Man to face, since he wanted the film to remain grounded in reality as much as possible. It was decided to have a foe in the film who would serve as a parallel of Stark (for example, an armored opponent). Well-known enemies like the Titanium Man and the Crimson Dynamo were considered, but finally the lesser-known Iron Monger, Obadiah Stane, was chosen as Iron Man's adversary (Stane, as well as possessing his own armor, is also a business contemporary of Stark)."", u""The climactic showdown in the film, with Tony Stark, a.k.a. Iron Man, facing Obadiah Stane, a.k.a. Iron Monger, is based on Iron Man #200 (November 1986).

It\'s quite likely that members of the cast and/or crew of the film were familiar with the Santa Monica restaurant and used it as an art model for the San Francisco locale.

In fact, MacFarlane even appeared in two episodes of Star Trek: Enterprise (2001) during its final two years of production.', u""Lacey Chabert left the show during the second season, in order to focus on her schooling and other projects, not because of objections to the show's content, as some have claimed."", u""Stewie's full name is Stewart Gilligan Griffin."", u'The Griffins always seem to have the same thing for dinner: three pieces of some kind of beef, mashed potatoes and peas. This is similar to the television show Daria (1997), where the Morgendorffer family will usually have lasagna. Coincidentally, this show and Daria (1997) have characters named ""Chris Griffin"".', u'Every episode contains cutaways, starting off with ""Like that time I..."" or ""This is worse/better than...""', u'The first part of the opening credits, where Lois plays the piano and sings with Peter, is a spoof of Edith playing the piano, and singing with Archie, during the opening credits of All in the Family (1971).', u'The characters of Peter and Brian are very similar to Larry and Steve from the shorts The Life of Larry (1995) and What a Cartoon: Larry & Steve (1996), which feature a moronic man who adopts a talking dog and puts the dog through hell, and were both written and directed by Seth MacFarlane.', u'The saying ""What the hell?!"" is said in every episode.', u'Originally, this was going to be a kids show on Cartoon Network called Larry and Steve.', u'Brian is a struggling novelist. Throughout the series, everyone in the family has made jokes about his ""unfinished novel"". In the episode ""Movin\' Out (Brian\'s Song)"", it is revealed that the title of Brian\'s novel is ""Faster Than The Speed of Love"". When he describes the story to Lois, it turns out to be a rip-off of the film Iron Eagle (1986).', u""Like real-life children, Chris and Meg share the facial or body features of their parents, Peter and Lois. Meg has the same hairstyle, nose, and mouth as Lois (although Lois is considered very attractive, and Meg very ugly in the show's universe) and has brown hair and wears glasses like Peter. As for Chris, he has eyes like Lois and a nose, mouth, and cleft chin like Peter. Chris has one attribute he shares with neither parent: His blond hair. However, in the early pre-production stages of the series, Lois was supposed to have blonde hair, but the creative team decided to make her a redhead. Despite the change, they chose to leave Chris' hair blond."", u'Believing the series to be cancelled after season two, many of the writers took on other jobs for different shows. The show was renewed for a third season at the last minute. Many new writers were used for the new seasons.', u'All of the high-end hotels seen on the show have Barrington in their name. Series Creator Seth MacFarlane has stated they are named after the city of Barrington, Rhode Island, a very upscale community.', u'""Quahog,"" the name of the Griffin\'s hometown, is also the name of an edible clam. Clams are referenced elsewhere in the show. Some examples: The bar the characters frequently visit is called ""The Drunken Clam"" and the strip club the guys visit on occasion is called ""The Fuzzy Clam"".', u'Brian drives a Toyota Prius, with a license plate that says ""BRI DOG"" on it, and a Kucinich bumper sticker.', u'Throughout the series, references have been made to the fact that some characters voices sound similar due to them being voiced by the same person. In ""Believe it or not Joe\'s Walking on Air"" (2007), Peter tells Dr. Hartman that his voice sounds similar to Carter Pewterschmidt (both voiced by Seth MacFarlane). In ""Guy, Robot"" (2015), Carl does an impression of Archer from the television series Archer (2009), and Bob from the television series Bob\'s Burgers (2011), who are all voiced by the same person, H.

Cleveland\'s phrase of choice in the same situation is ""...and boom goes the dynamite."" (albeit spoken in an unexcited monotone voice as Cleveland usually speaks.)', u'Glen Quagmire is left handed, but plays guitar right handed.', u'Seth MacFarlane graduated from the Rhode Island School of Design in Providence. The shell of the quahog clam (Mercenaria mercenaria) is the official Rhode Island State shell. A quahog is a pretty standard looking clam, except that it\'s big, about the size of a grown man\'s hand. Rhode Islanders like to eat them in clam chowder (not white chowder, but clear, made without milk). They also stuff the clams with a bread and clam stuffing, and serve them for dinner. The area\'s Native Americans, the Narragansetts, called them ""quahog"", which means simply ""clam"". They used the purple part of the shells to make wampum, which was traded by Native American tribes throughout North America.', u'Brian has a tattoo of the comic character Ziggy.', u'The series began airing in high definition with Family Guy: And Then There Were Fewer (2010). However, Family Guy: Excellence in Broadcasting (2010) is the first episode to acknowledge the transition to the new format.', u'Lacey Chabert was originally the voice of Meg Griffin until 2000, when Mila Kunis was given the job.', u""The character of Neil Goldman, the boy who perennially chases Meg, is named after one of the show's writers."", u""Brought back an unprecedented second time after its amazing DVD sales (record for best selling television show on DVD), and its popularity on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim, which a few times had a higher Nielsen rating than broadcast television at that time slot."", u'The running gag with Mr. Herbert is that his name ""rhymes"" with ""pervert"" which pertains to his creepy demeanor regarding young boys.', u'Meg goes to James Woods Reqional (with a ""Q"") High School, and Chris goes to Buddy Cianci Junior High in fictional Quahog, Rhode Island. James Woods is from Warwick, Rhode Island, and Vincent ""Buddy"" Cianci, Jr. is the former Mayor of Providence, Rhode Island.', u'The original idea for titles of episodes were supposed to be based on 1940s Mystery Radio shows. This is why the first few episodes have some sort of reference to death in them. Eventually the writers of the show had to start describing the episodes to one another (rather than simply using the titles), so that idea was dropped.', u'Before Seth MacFarlane created the idea of a regular half-hour series, he conceived of the Griffin family appearing as characters in animated shorts to appear on MADtv (1995). Many of the regular voice actors (including Alex Borstein, Phil LaMarr, Debra Wilson and Nicole Sullivan) are MADtv alumni. Alex Borstein was the first cast on this show and is the only ""official"" cast member as the voice of Lois Griffin.', u'In the early seasons, in the opening credits, the pictures on the wall of Chris, Meg, and Stewie, in the background, have blurred faces. Later on, however, their faces appear normally.', u'Angela, Peter\'s boss was voiced by Carrie Fisher, most famously known for the Star Wars saga, and when this show decided to air their own Star Wars parodies, in ""It\'s A Trap!!!"" She played Mon Mothma, ironically for her role as Princess Leia.', u'Stewie\'s favorite song is ""Hungry Eyes"" by Eric Carmen.', u""In early episodes of the series, the rest of the family can seemingly hear what Stewie says. In more recent episodes this becomes ambiguous: at times it's unclear altogether, other times (when it's convenient for plot development) they seem to somewhat understand."", u'Starting with season four, the characters no longer look totally to the left or right. They now look at an angle when looking at something to their side.', u""Throughout the whole series, almost all of the main characters have been in the hospital due to injury by either their own or Peter's carelessness."", u'Ranked #12 in TV Guide\'s list of the ""25 Top Cult Shows Ever!""

The very next word is ""quahog"", which is where the show takes place.', u""Quagmire's voice is loosely based on 1950's ad men (giggity!)."", u""Peter's white shirt is a woman's shirt. The right side (his right) buttons over the left. On men's shirts it's the other way around."", u""On Family Guy: Love Thy Trophy (2000), Stewie's ABC blocks pyramidally spell REDRUM, a reference to Stephen King's novel and Stanley Kubrick's movie The Shining (1980), where REDRUM was MURDER spelled backwards. Which is what Stewie plans to do to Lois."", u'In season seven, episode fourteen, ""We Love You, Conrad"", Stewie tells Brian that Bruce Jenner is a woman. The show was prescient, because (now) Caitlyn\'s gender reassignment happened several years later, around season twelve.', u'In the intro, because Joe is disabled and unable to move his legs, he lifts them with his hands.', u'Peter Griffin and Cleveland were both born on November 11.', u'In 2014. Shortly after a repeat of Viewer Mail (#10.22) was broadcast on BBC3. There was a news report announcing the death of comedian Robin Williams, who had committed suicide. In Viewer Mail (#10.22), everyone and everything that Peter touches, turns into Robin Williams, which also depicted Robin Williams making a failed suicide attempt. (#10.22) foreshadowed the real-life death of the comedian.', u""Chris's birthday is February 8th, as is Seth Green's, who voices Chris."", u'John G. Brennan (Mort Goldman) originally read for Peter Griffin, because creator Seth MacFarlane is a big fan of ""The Jerky Boys"".', u""After the shows first cancellation in 2002, many of the shows writers would go on to create the hit Nickelodeon cartoon Avatar: The Last Airbender (2005). Including Avatar's Creator Michael Dante DiMartino."", u'Many of the KEN conference attendees in Dumb and Dumber To (2014) are played by writers of the series.', u'On at least one occasion, Quagmire references a porno channel called ""Skin-A-Max"" (a nickname for Cinemax, due to their late night ""Adults Only"" programming). The name ""Skin-A-Max"" was first used by Seth Green in Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery (1997) , who, of course, plays Chris Griffin on this show.', u""In one episode, Party of Five (1994) is mentioned, and Peter asks if that's a porno. Lacey Chabert, who voiced Meg in early episodes, appeared on the show."", u'In earlier seasons, Brian, Chris, or Stewie can be heard seperate from the other\'s voices when they dance and sing ""He\'s our family guy!""

Other episodes show this running gag of his expressions on blocks.', u'The song the marching band plays is very similar to (almost note-for-note), and likely based on, the theme song to Coach (1989).', u'Two Kraft Foods (now Kraft Heinz Company) products are the subjects of running gags on the show. The Kool-Aid Man, mascot for the beverage Kool-Aid, often breaks through a wall after multiple utterances of the phrase ""oh no!"", whereas he says ""oh yeah!"".

Additionally, before the original Kraft split into two companies, the Nabisco subdivision\'s Wheat Thins had an advertisement series featuring Brian and Stewie.

He was particularly enamored by Sidney Lumet's Fail-Safe (1964) and 12 Angry Men (1957), and Jean-Luc Godard's Breathless (1960). He even tried unsuccessfully to procure the same lenses used on the French film."", u""David Strathairn was always George Clooney's first consideration to play Edward R.

Murrow to a game of the Knickerbockers, better known as the New York Knicks. In the movie Eddie (1996), Langella played Wild Bill Burgess, the owner of the New York Knicks.', u'The film cast includes three Oscar winners: George Clooney, Tom McCarthy, and Grant Heslov; and four Oscar nominees: David Strathairn, Patricia Clarkson, Frank Langella and Robert Downey, Jr.', u""The movie's title was the catchphrase Edward R.

When he passed on it, several other options were briefly considered before Val Kilmer was offered the role.', u'The movie shares its title with a song from the soundtrack of the James Bond movie Thunderball (1965). ""Mr. Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" was recorded first by Shirley Bassey, and then Dionne Warwick after Composer John Barry had chosen the title when he read a magazine article which mentioned that was how Bond was known in Italy. However, the producers got cold feet at the last moment, and asked him to write a title song, ""Thunderball"", which was performed by Tom Jones.

As such, they came up with the design of the plane seen in the film - the feet restraints, the cage door, the mechanical locking system, the open toilet, et cetera.', u'For shooting the scene of the airplane crash, the production leased a real Boeing 727 from a Las Vegas casino owner, purchased two fuselages for the post-crash scenes, and built a one thousand pound model for the actual moment of impact. The scene of the crash was shot on a miniature road twelve hundred feet long, with the one thousand-pound model plane moving at sixty miles per hour.

Barrows then planted Sheridan's fingerprints, to give Lamb his suspect, and Chen arranged Sheridan's assignation on the prisoner transit plane, so Sheridan wouldn't talk. Royce was never part of the conspiracy, and blinded by revenge on Sheridan for killing his two friends, he never killed Newman when Newman saw Royce trying to shoot Sheridan in cold blood. Additional scenes were shot in post-production, after test screenings showed that the audience wanted Gerard chasing down another innocent fugitive, like he did in the first film."", u'Tommy Lee Jones and Michael Paul Chan also appeared in Batman Forever (1995).', u'Possibly an in-joke from the filmmakers, one of the pilots of the plane strongly resembles Harrison Ford, who coincidentally starred in The Fugitive (1993), of which this movie is a sequel.', u'Joe Pantoliano and Michael Paul Chan previously appeared in The Goonies (1985).', u'Wesley Snipes starred in Blade II (2002), the same year Stuart Baird directed Star Trek: Nemesis (2002).

In the finished film, a model spider was superimposed on a static shot of Kristin Scott Thomas.', u""In the play, Queen Elizabeth simply disappears after Act 4 Scene 4, so a scene in Richmond's headquarters where Richmond marries the princess was added to give a proper resolution for the Queen, being the principal survivor of the film.

As such, he found it very difficult to perform his part. However, Stone was delighted that when the film came out, Dangerfield's performance was hailed as one of the movie's strongest points."", u'Oliver Stone calls the frequent cuts to black and white, where dialogue is often repeated with a slightly different intonation, ""vertical cutting"". Stone explains that the idea behind the technique is to create an outer moment (the color footage) and an inner moment (the black and white footage) at the same time. For example, he explains this in relation to the waitress in the opening scene (O-Lan Jones), who while taking Mickey\'s order in the \'outer\' scene, is actually flirting with him (or thinking about flirting with him) in the \'inner\' scene. Also in the opening scene, when the cowboy (James Gammon) refers to Mallory as ""pussy"", there is a flash cut to Mickey covered in blood; this is Mickey\'s \'inner\' moment.', u'During filming, Oliver Stone would play African tribal music at full blast on the set, as a way of keeping a frantic mood.', u'The camera never angles on a straight, horizontal level throughout the whole film.', u""The color green is used to indicate the sickness in Mickey's mind and shows up prominently several times during the film: the key lime pie at the diner, the green neon at the drugstore, the green room in the prison."", u'The prison riot was filmed at Stateville Correctional Center in Joliet, Illinois. Eighty percent of the prisoners there, are there for violent crimes. For the first two of four weeks on location, the extras were actual inmates with rubber weapons. For the other two weeks, over 200 extras had to be brought in, because the Stateville inmates had been placed on lockdown.', u'Over 150 rattlesnakes, both real and fake, were used for the scene when Mickey and Mallory tread through the snake field. Initially there were concerns that the actors would being working too close to so many venomous snakes. But since the scene was filmed at night (when temperatures in the desert are significantly cooler), and since snakes (like all cold-blooded animals) are very sluggish in colder temperatures, most of the rattlesnakes slept through the filming of the scene.', u'In an infamous incident after the film had been released, Oliver Stone and Time Warner were sued by Patsy Byers, with the support of author and film producer John Grisham. In March 1995, 18-year-old Sarah Edmondson and her boyfriend Benjamin Darras (also 18) allegedly dropped acid and watched \'Natural Born Killers\'. Later that night, Sarah shot and paralyzed Byers, a store clerk in Ponchatoula, and Benjamin killed cotton gin manager William Savage in Hernando, Mississippi. John Grisham was a personal friend of Savage\'s, and after the murder, Grisham publicly accused Oliver Stone of being irresponsible in making the film, arguing that filmmakers should be held accountable for their work when it incites violent behavior. Byers decided to take legal action against Stone and the studio, and supported by Grisham, she used a ""product liability"" claim in the lawsuit, which argued that Stone had incited the teenagers to commit the crime. Initially, the case was dismissed in January 1997, on the grounds that filmmakers and production companies are protected by the First Amendment. However, in May 1998, the Intermediate Louisiana Court of Appeals overturned the lower court\'s decision, and the case went ahead. The attorneys for Byers\' attempted to prove that Stone and Warner were culpable in the murder and in Byers\' injury because they had purposefully meant to incite violence by ""distributing a film they knew, or should have known would cause and inspire people to commit crimes"". All of Hollywood eagerly awaited the outcome of the trial, because if Stone was found guilty, it would mean a drastic reexamination of the industry practices and would carry all kinds of far reaching implications as regards the content of movies. However, in a landmark decision, Byers\' action was thrown out of court in March 2001, and its dismissal was rubber-stamped by the Louisiana Court of Appeal in June 2002.', u'Took only 56 days to shoot.', u'When producers Jane Hamsher and Don Murphy first brought Quentin Tarantino\'s screenplay to Oliver Stone\'s attention, Stone\'s initial idea was to make a lighthearted all-action blockbuster. His previous film, Taivas ja maa (1993), had been a difficult shoot which had failed at the box office, and he saw \'Natural Born Killers\' as a way to make a fun movie and play with genre conventions. As he puts it himself in Chaos Rising: The Storm Around \'Natural Born Killers\' (2001), he planned to make ""something Arnold Schwarzenegger would be proud of."" As the project developed however, Stone found the movie getting deeper and deeper, and soon all hopes for a simple action spectacular were gone.', u""The film features Rodney Dangerfield's only dramatic performance."", u'Robert Downey, Jr. spent time with Australian television shock-king Steve Dunleavy to prepare for the role of Wayne Gale, and when he came back with an Australian accent, the filmmakers decided to go with it, and Gale became an Australian.', u'Oliver Stone has always maintained that the film is a satire on how serial killers are adored by the media for their horrific actions, and that those who claim the violence in the movie itself is a cause of societal violence have missed the point of the movie entirely.', u""When putting together the music for the film, Oliver Stone and soundtrack producer Trent Reznor both wanted to get Snoop Dogg involved, but Warner wouldn't allow it, as Dogg was on trial for murder at the time."", u""According to Oliver Stone, the use of television commercials was an attempt to illustrate the comforting power such commercials have. Every commercial comes after a horrific moment or a flash cut of a demon, and Stone's idea was that commercials work to soothe people after they have been exposed to something extreme."", u""In the mess hall in the prison, a bald white man is staring at a black man, prompting the black man to try to attack him, before being intercepted by Warden McClusky (Tommy Lee Jones). The bald man was a real prisoner, who had been convicted of murdering his wife and children by beating them to death with a lead pipe. Oliver Stone gave him a featured role, because he said the man's stoicism terrified him."", u'Michael Madsen was initially considered for the role of Mickey, but Warner Bros. wanted somebody less intimidating, and with a softer persona, as they felt this might alleviate the brutality of the character somewhat.', u'The story told on ""American Maniacs"" about Mickey killing a cop after asking him for directions is taken almost verbatim from a story made up by J. Edgar Hoover in the 1930s about bank robbers Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker to try to quash the public\'s growing favorable opinion of the pair. According to Hoover, Barrow approached an Oklahoma City officer, asked for directions and then blew his head off with a shotgun. The story fell apart, though, when questions were raised as to how, if the officer was alone when he was killed, Hoover could possibly have determined that it was Barrow who killed him, as there were no witnesses to the ""murder.""', u'Director of Photography Robert Richardson hated the script, and didn\'t want anything to do with the film, but Oliver Stone used their close friendship to persuade him to accept the job. For numerous reasons, Richardson called shooting the film a ""nightmare"" and one of the worst experiences of his life. The story brought up bad memories from his childhood, leading to insomnia, and a dependence on sleeping pills, throughout the entire shoot. During location scouting, his wife Monona Wali nearly died from an illness (and they later came close to divorcing because of the film). While filming a difficult scene, he broke his finger, and the replacement cameraman cut his eye. Near the end of shooting, his brother went into a coma. However, Richardson has said that all of these problems actually provided him with the creative energy he needed to shoot the film.', u'Oliver Stone wanted Juliette Lewis to bulk up for the role of Mallory so that she looked tougher, but Lewis refused, saying she wanted the character to look like a pushover, not like a female bodybuilder. In the end, Stone agreed, but he insisted she take kick-boxing lessons so that she looked credible when fighting.', u""After Quentin Tarantino had written the script, he promised his friend Rand Vossler, a fellow clerk at Video Archives, the director's chair. The pair couldn't find funding, and eventually decided to shoot it guerrilla-style (without permits) on the streets of Los Angeles, on black and white 16mm film stock. Shortly before production, Oliver Stone found the script and wanted to buy it. In exchange for giving up his directorial debut, Rand is credited as a co-producer."", u'Entertainment Weekly ranked the film as the 8th most controversial movie ever made.', u""Woody Harrelson, in an interview, spoke about the rape scene between Mickey and the hostage he takes. He expressed his hope that Oliver Stone had not added any additional footage of the controversial part into the Director's Cut. He was promptly told on camera that Stone had indeed done so."", u""Oliver Stone says that his biggest regret about the film is the fact that he had to cut out most of Pruitt Taylor Vince's performance as the prison guard Kavanaugh. As filmed, Kavanaugh becomes a comic character, who Mickey uses as a shield while moving through the prison, and who ends up being shot sixteen times by the time Mickey meets Warden McClusky (Tommy Lee Jones) at the stairs. In the finished version of the film, you don't actually see Kavanaugh being shot at all, prior to the stairs. Stone says he was forced to cut much of this, because the studio insisted that the movie be under two hours. Strangely however, the footage of Kavanaugh was not restored by Stone for his Director's Cut, nor was it included as a deleted scene on the DVD."", u'Steve Buscemi and Tim Roth were both offered the role of Wayne Gale, and turned it down. Jane Hamsher claims in her book about the movie, that they did so because Quentin Tarantino told them he would never cast either of them in any of his movies again, if they took the role.', u'This film contains almost 3,000 cuts. Most films have 600-700. Negative cutter Donah Bassett cut 4,000 negative images into the film, the most complex job ever undertaken by a negative cutter.', u'The editing of the film took eleven months.', u""Tommy Lee Jones has said that his over-the-top performance was partly inspired by Moli\xe8re's play 'Le Bourgeois gentilhomme'; a satirical look at social climbing and the bizarre things people will do to achieve fame."", u'The idea for the image of the headless man came to Oliver Stone in a dream.', u'Senator Bob Dole publicly denounced the film for its promotion of violence, even though, as he was later forced to admit, he had never actually seen the film.', u""This was Quentin Tarantino's second feature length screenplay (his first was True Romance (1993)). The script was rewritten by Oliver Stone, producer Richard Rutowski and screenwriter David Veloz prior to, and during production. The finished film bears little resemblance to Tarantino's original script."", u""The interview between Wayne Gale and Mickey was based upon Geraldo Rivera's interviews with Charles Manson and the infamous Mike Wallace interview with Manuel Noriega."", u""According to a newspaper article seen briefly at approximately 27 minutes in, Mickey and Mallory's murder spree began on May 7, 1993."", u'During the scene where Micky and Mallory take a hostage to a motel room, the films Midnight Express (1978) and Scarface (1983) are showing on television. Oliver Stone wrote the screenplays to both films.', u""Mickey Knox is named after actor Mickey Knox, who wrote the English dialogue for The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966) and Once Upon a Time in the West (1968), Quentin Tarantino's favorite westerns."", u'For the numerous scenes involving rear projection, the projected footage was shot prior to principal photography, then edited together, and projected live onto the stage, behind the live actors. For example, when Mallory drives past a building and flames are projected onto the wall, this was shot live using footage projected onto the fa\xe7ade of a real building.', u'Oliver Stone met with singer Tori Amos and openly offered her the part of Mallory. Early in her career Amos had been pursing acting as well as singing. She was interested, until he explained he also wanted to have her song ""Me and a Gun"" play during each scene where Mallory kills someone. The song is an a capella account of Amos\' real life rape. In response, Amos slapped him across the face and stormed out. Amos details this story in her autobiography ""All These Years"". She also references the incident in her hit song ""A Sorta Fairytale"", with the lyrics: ""Feel better with Oliver Stone until I almost smacked him; it seemed right that night.""', u'When Jack Scagnetti (Tom Sizemore) goes into Mallory\'s cell, and throughout this scene, you can read two different paragraphs above the door in the cell, and below Mallory, on the bedside. The one near the door reads: ""Come let\'s away / to prison we two / alone will sing / like birds in a cage."" This is from \'King Lear\', a play written by William Shakespeare, as Lear and his daughter Cordelia are being taken away to prison. The other paragraph reads: ""He is coming! He is coming! / Like a bridegroom from his room / Came the hero from his prison / To the scaffold and the doom."" These lines are from the poem ""The Execution Of Montrose"" by William Edmondstoune Aytoun.', u'Tom Sizemore plays Detective Jack Scagnetti in this film. The name ""Scagnetti"" was also mentioned as the name of Mr. Blonde\'s parole officer in Reservoir Dogs (1992), also written by Quentin Tarantino.', u'Robert Downey, Jr. and Tom Sizemore both later served time in prison, for drug-related offenses.', u'The title card for the film is an homage to Roger Corman.', u'The drug store scene was filmed in an Albuquerque building, that was a real drug store, that had closed just prior to filming. The original fixtures and pharmacy area were still in the store, making set up very easy. The sign above the door was added for the movie, and was still there several months after filming ended. The building is now a Hobby Lobby. 1,000 green fluorescent bulbs were used to light the scene.', u'Owen (Arliss Howard), the inmate that helps Mickey and Mallory out of the prison, is shown in the first scene. He is at a table reading a newspaper that reads ""666 death"". He is only shown for a second. He is also seen in the prison as Wayne Gale (Robert Downey, Jr.) tells Warden McClusky (Tommy Lee Jones) how famous he could become; Owen is mopping the floor behind them as they walk past a cell.', u'The scene where the police beat up Mickey and Mallory, at the pharmacy, was purposely shot as a take on the Rodney King incident.', u'Mallory\'s line to Scagnetti about him being ""so specific"" when he asks her to pinch his nipple was improvised by Juliette Lewis on set.', u'A scene featuring Denis Leary, doing a crazed monologue, was cut from the film. However, it can be found be on the DVD.', u""The main characters are loosely based on Charles Starkweather and Caril Fugate, a young Nebraska couple, who in 1958, embarked on a mass murder spree across the Midwest, that horrified the country. The characters in Terrence Malick's Badlands (1973) are also loosely based on Starkweather and Fugate."", u""Scagnetti's (Tom Sizemore) story about how his mother was killed, was based upon a real life incident involving one of America's first mass murderers, Charles Whitman, who did actually shoot people randomly from the University Tower in Austin, Texas, in 1966."", u'In late 1994, the film was banned from theatrical distribution in Ireland. The Irish Film Centre, which is a membership club, and not subject to the same rules as public theaters, booked the film and had it scheduled to screen for a month long run in early 1995. The film censorship board threatened legal action if the film was shown, and it was withdrawn.', u'The bridge where Mickey and Mallory get married, is the Rio Grande Gorge Bridge over the Rio Grande Gorge, outside of Taos, New Mexico.', u'Acclaimed as the #1 film of the 1990s by Entertainment Weekly.', u""In the UK, the film's video release was to be the same week that Thomas Hamilton walked into a primary school, in the Scottish town of Dunblane, and killed sixteen children and a teacher, before killing himself. Warner Brothers immediately went to the British Board of Film Classification to take another look at the certification granted the film. The BBFC however stood by their decision, so Warner Brothers took it upon themselves to withhold video release. Thus, when the film had its television premiere on the UK's channel 5 two years later, it became one of the few films to be broadcast on television, without having a video release beforehand."", u'Premiere voted this movie as one of ""The 25 Most Dangerous Movies"".', u'Gary Oldman and James Woods were considered for the role of Jack Scagnetti.', u'Rodney Dangerfield wrote all the ""filthy stuff"" his character said. Oliver Stone didn\'t give the comedian a script; he simply told Dangerfield he was going to play ""the father from hell.""', u'Woody Harrelson said he was cast because Oliver Stone told him he had the look of violence in his eyes.', u""Deputy Sheriff Duncan Homolka's (Joe Grifasi) name is a reference to Karla Homolka who, with her husband Paul Bernardo, murdered two teenage girls and her own sister."", u""The unique look of the film was based upon Arthur Penn's Bonnie and Clyde (1967), one of Oliver Stone's favorite movies. In particular, Stone was influenced by the famous death scene, which used innovative editing techniques provided by multiple cameras shooting from different angles at different speeds. Stone had used similar, although considerably more restrained, techniques in his previous two films, JFK - avoin tapaus (1991) and Taivas ja maa (1993), and would continue to employ these techniques for his next two films, Nixon (1995) and U-k\xe4\xe4nn\xf6s helvettiin (1997)."", u""The film was originally going to be shot in Panavision, as Oliver Stone's previous four films had been, but he decided that it should be framed in standard 1.85:1. The Panavision E-Series anamorphic lenses that had been reserved for the film were used to shoot The Pelican Brief (1993) instead."", u'John Cusack turned down the role of Wayne Gale.', u""Three years prior, Robert De Niro and Juliette Lewis had worked together on Cape Fear (1991). When De Niro praised her work in the film, Lewis explained that she improvised most of her lines, which De Niro did not like. He admonished the young actress for disrespecting the film's writers."", u""According to Tom Sizemore, he got the part of Detective Jack Scagnetti after writing a monologue for the character, which he made Oliver Stone listen to in the parking lot of a bar. In addition to reading up on Ted Bundy and John Wayne Gacy, he got clean for 97 days before filming. Unfortunately, the sobriety didn't last."", u'Rodney Dangerfield and Robert Downey, Jr. also co-starred in the college-party comedy Back to School (1986).', u'Mickey calls Mallory ""Mal"". In Spanish, ""Mal"" is the common word for ""evil"".', u'Chris Penn turned down the role of Jack Scagnetti in favor of True Romance (1993), which was also written by Quentin Tarantino.', u'Oliver Stone considered this to be his road film, specifically naming Bonnie and Clyde (1967) as a source of inspiration.', u'Rosanna Arquette pursued the role of Mallory.', u'The film cast includes three Oscar winners: Tommy Lee Jones, Steven Wright, and Adrien Brody; and three Oscar nominees: Woody Harrelson, Juliette Lewis, and Robert Downey, Jr.', u""Whilst shooting the POV scene, wherein Mallory runs into the wire mesh, Robert Richardson broke his finger, and the replacement cameraman cut his eye.

The story behind this change in directors was chronicled in the book ""Killer Instinct"" written by producer Jane Hamsher.', u'Joe Grifasi who plays Deputy Sheriff Duncan Homolka would later costar with Tommy Lee Jones again in Batman Forever (1995), with Jones as Two-Face and Grifasi as a hostage.', u'The wrestling match that Rodney Dangerfield is watching involves Chris Chavis as Tatanka (the Native American wrestler) and Barry Hardy.', u'The song ""Back in Baby\'s Arms"" plays on the soundtrack at one point.

Tommy Lee Jones is from Texas.', u""The red glasses Mickey wears during the opening scene of the movie are reminiscent of chicken glasses, tiny red glasses once sold to farmers to keep their chickens from murdering one another. The red glass kept the chickens from seeing the color red, or more specifically, blood. For some strange reason, when chickens see red, they peck at it. If they see red on a chicken in the flock, they gang together and peck at the bloody spot until the offending chicken is dead ... conversely, in that opening scene, once Mickey and Mallory saw red, they didn't stop until almost everyone was dead. Industrialization now keeps chickens pinned up, and incapable of getting at one another, so chicken glasses are no longer used."", u'Kathy Long: is the female police officer who beats up Mickey at the pharmacy.', u'Don Murphy: one of the jovial guards who gets shot and killed by Mickey, when he begins his escape from prison, after the interview with Wayne Gale.', u'Jane Hamsher: as a demon-like character during a hallucination sequence.', u'Richard Rutowski: a demon during the prison riot', u'Hank Corwin: is the headless man in the living room.', u""During Mickey's escape from prison during the tornado, there is a shot where a convict falls under a galloping horse. This was completely genuine, as the stuntman really did lose his footing and fall under the horse. Fortunately, he was uninjured."", u""Oliver Stone's least favorite scene in the film is when Mickey overpowers the prison guards after the interview with Wayne Gale is terminated.

Lobell noted, ""When I read the script, I thought that if Cybill was going to return to features, this should be it, because the film is a romantic comedy, and I always thought of Cybill as very funny in a Carole Lombard way."" Ardolino noted that Shepherd shared qualities with her character that made her the ideal candidate for Corinne Jeffries. Ardolino said, ""Corinne is beautiful and determined, yet she\'s vulnerable, with a sense of humor, not unlike Cybill\'s own. Corinne is loyal and passionate and obsessed with love, because she cares so deeply about someone.""', u'The movie appealed to Cybill Shepherd for two reasons, which were her character Corinne Jeffries, and Emile Ardolino.

Corinne Jeffries interested Shepherd because she was a departure from her real persona, and from her television alter-ego of Maddie Hayes on Moonlighting (1985). Shepherd noted: ""Many moons ago, Stella Adler told me I should play what I haven\'t lived. It would help me with life, and so I\'ve used this as a general guide for parts. Corinne was a good part for me, because it offered a lot of challenges. To play a character at twenty-one, and again in her early 40s. Someone who experiences the devastation of losing her husband, and a mom with a grown up daughter. All those things, except being twenty-one, which I have no interest in being again, were new to me.""', u'Perry Howze and Randy Howze brought their script to Producer Mike Lobell, who immediately responded.

Corinne Jeffries' predicament, as invented by the Howzes, is to raise funds to enlarge the First Ladies display, through a gala event. They queried the Smithsonian, asking if this character and her plight sounded plausible. It was more than plausible. The Smithsonian, in fact, was trying to raise two million dollars for the display.

The part required an accomplished performer who could portray a multi-dimensional role, an appealing leading man who could balance romance with comedy, as well as convincingly playing two characters in one. Robert Downey, Jr., named the ""Hottest Actor of the Year"" by Rolling Stone Magazine, was their man. A veteran film actor, Downey\'s memorable performances in a variety of roles, both supporting and starring, had earned him critical respect and audience popularity. Emile Ardolino said, ""Robert is an extraordinary talent, who is skillful, passionate, innately funny, sexy, and always surprising. He brings a tremendous amount of vitality and complexity to all of his performances.', u'The filmmakers immediately thought of Mary Stuart Masterson to play Corinne Jeffries\' (Cybill Shepherd\'s) daughter Miranda, the independent Yale law student powerfully attracted to her Yale classmate-turned-house-guest, Alex Finch (Robert Downey, Jr.). When approached for the role, Masterson was initially noncommittal. Mike Lobell\'s tenacity, however, was persuasive. Masterton recalled: ""I went to Sundance, Utah, to think things over and ski, when Mike Lobell came skiing down the slopes after me with pen and contract in hand, saying, \'you must do this movie, it will be the best thing you\'ve ever done\'. He was obviously very convincing.""', u'Mary Stuart Masterson noted of her character Miranda, that it added a new dimension to her repertoire: ""Miranda is more intellectual than any other character I\'ve played, You know, I usually play street smart urchins, pregnant, and barefoot."" Nonetheless, the press kit states Masterson personally related to Miranda: ""I went to schools very much like Yale. They were pressure cookers."" she said of her years at the prestigious Dalton School in New York City, and later at New York University, where she studied anthropology and film.""', u'Attention to detail for the look and feel of the film extended to Cybill Shepherd. The filmmakers and Shepherd wanted her character of Corinne Jeffries to appear as different as possible from her Moonlighting (1985) Maddie Hayes character. To achieve this, they cut her hair at least five inches in a more conservative style. Costume Designer Albert Wolsky draped Shepherd in a lot of black and/or structured clothing at the beginning of the film, also noting that ""We never see her wearing black on Moonlighting (1985)."" In the second half of the film, as Corinne Jeffries (Cybill Shepherd) starts to mentally and physically open up, Wolsky dressed her in softer, more voluminous creations. Wolsky explained: ""Her colors get softer, the fabrics go from wools to chiffons and cottons."" Director of Photography William A. Fraker highlighted Shepherd with his own special brand of luminous lighting. The veteran Cinematographer was well suited for the movie, not only was his work highly respected within the film industry, but, having shot Shepherd in her Loreal commercials, Fraker was very familiar with the actress.', u'Real-life Washington Post journalist Benjamin C. Bradlee wasn\'t the only genuine Washington, D.C. article to appear in the movie. Ben Bradlee, in the film, is a real-life character based on Benjamin C. Bradlee, and is played in the movie by Henderson Forsythe. Perry Howze said: ""We sent him (Bradlee) the script, and he and his wife Sally Quinn read it, and loved it. His only stipulation was to clean up his language. We had a few \'hells\' and some choice expletives coming out of his mouth, and he said, \'for God\'s sake, get those four letter words out. I don\'t talk like that\'."" The real-life Bradlee later appeared in the documentary Fuck (2005).', u'The film was described by Emile Ardolino as ""A romantic comedy about love, and the transforming effect it has on our characters\' lives. It\'s about people who learn to live mortally in the present by letting go of the past. Imagine this happened to you: you\'re a normal person, and all of a sudden you get your memory back from your past life, and you realize that your girlfriend is your daughter, and her mother is your wife from your previous life. I was intrigued by the comic possibilities of this predicament. We\'ve all probably gone to a place we\'ve never been, and felt like we\'ve been there before. We\'ve met a person for the first time, and felt as though we\'ve known them our entire lives.""', u'The film opens up in Washington, D.C., in the 1960s. The setting was deliberate. Randy Howze explained: ""Washington was magical then. The Kennedy Presidency was in full force. There was so much promise, and like that, Corinne\'s life starts out so blissfully. She is marrying the man of her dreams, Louie Jeffries. The couple has everything going for them, and ahead of them, like the \'Camelot Years\', and then, boom, it all ends, and we cut to twenty years later, where again the times are reflected in Corinne\'s life. She\'s now a modern working woman, and a single parent.""', u'Show-business trade-paper ""Variety"" said of this movie in its review, ""Here comes Chances Are, and there goes Mr. Jordan"", a reference to the earlier heavenly comedy Here Comes Mr. Jordan (1941), which had been remade as Heaven Can Wait (1978).', u'Snaring two Washington, D.C. prime locations, the Smithsonian Institute and the Washington Post, proved to be challenges indeed. As Mike Lobell explained: ""The Smithsonian took about four months to give us the go ahead. They, for good reason, were very concerned about how they would be portrayed to the public. We had to assure them that we would present the institution in the best possible light. They finally agreed, and treated us wonderfully in Washington."" Securing the Washington Post was due, in part, to Perry Howze and Randy Howze. Lobell said, ""We were fortunate because our screenwriters, who grew up in Washington, D.C., had been childhood friends of Benjamin C. Bradlee\'s daughters, and therefore knew Bradlee."" The production got the full support of the Washington Post, filming in front of the building, inside the press room, in its lobby, and at its printing presses. This was quite a coup it was thought by the filmmakers, considering that the newspaper had refused to cooperate with the filming of All the President\'s Men (1976).', u""The angels' tablets are shaped like the Ten Commandments."", u'Cybill Shepherd brought her then eight-month-old twins to the set every day.', u""The picture was shot in the U.S. on-location in Washington, D.C., and featured some of the city's famous landmarks, including Capitol Hill, the Smithsonian Institute, the Washington Post, the Jefferson Memorial, and the historic city of Georgetown."", u'Robert Downey, Jr. and Mary Stuart Masterson appeared in the documentary The Last Party (1993).', u""The amount of time between husband Louie Jeffries (Christopher McDonald) passing away in 1964, and then returning as another person inside Alex Finch's (Robert Downey, Jr.'s) body in 1987, was twenty-three years."", u'Ryan O\'Neal was cast as Philip Train. Perry Howze and Randy Howze described Philip Train as ""a noble character, the last gentleman roaming the earth, because he has respected Corinne Jeffries (Cybill Shepherd) and her love for her late husband, who was also his best friend, so much, that he has never tried to impose himself on her. He doesn\'t want to jeopardize their friendship. This kind of character doesn\'t exist in 1988, but we want him back in the world."" The film\'s press kit states: ""(Ryan) O\'Neal endowed Philip (Train) with the strength, vulnerability, and comedic sensitivity needed to ennoble this endearing underdog, a character who gives true modern meaning to the word \'gentleman\', as he waits for the woman he quietly loves, to someday take serious notice of him.""', u'Emile Ardolino and William A. Fraker wanted to give the movie a cohesive look, that would convey an old-fashioned romantic comedy, but they also wanted to emphasize certain distinctive aspects of the film. For example, the scenes set in the early 1960s would have a unique ambiance, distinguished from the scenes set in the present, and those set in a heavenly place, which the filmmakers refer to as ""Limbodrome"", had to be unusual and ethereal.', u""There was only a 15 year age difference between Cybill Shepherd and Robert Downey Jr.. Shepherd's character was widowed for 23 years when Downey shows up."", u""At 5-foot 7-inches tall, Robert Downey Jr. had to wear lifts in scenes with Cybill Shepherd and Ryan O'Neal."", u'After viewing Dirty Dancing (1987), Mike Lobell was certain that Emile Ardolino had the proper sentiment, compassion, and intimacy to direct this film. Lobell explained, ""I could see that Dirty Dancing (1987) was directed by a man who had a lot of heart, which was exactly what I wanted for our film.""', u'Debut on-screen performance in a theatrical movie of band leader Lester Lanin.', u""Cybill Shepherd had had a personal relationship with Peter Bogdanovich, who had directed Ryan O'Neal in Paper Moon (1973), What's Up, Doc? (1972), and Nickelodeon (1976)."", u'While living in Georgetown, at the beginning of the movie, you see through a window Jackie Kennedy leaving her house across the street. Showing that they are neighbors.', u'The working title for the film was ""Life After Life"".', u'The car Cybill Shepherd takes out of storage in the garage is a red 1963 Volkswagen convertible with a white top.', u'The accident scene that concludes the 1964 section of the story, was filmed on the night of June 7-8, 1988, when the TriStar film crew secured permission from the Mayor\'s Office of Film and TV Development, District of Columbia, to close Wisconsin Avenue NW in Georgetown between M and O Streets NW between 4 p.m. on Tuesday until dawn on Wednesday. Around two dozen 1960s vintage automobiles were secured from area car club members, many driven by their owners, to dress the street. These included a 1956 Buick Century, a 1957 Ford Fairlane 500, a 1959 Cadillac Seville, a 1959 Chevrolet Biscayne, a 1960 Mercury Comet dressed as City Cab 101, a 1960 Pontiac Star Chief, a 1958-1960 Edsel, a 1962 Studebaker Lark, a 1963 Chevrolet Corvette, and a matched pair of 1964 Volkswagen Beetles.

Then the mid-late 1980s saw a few more: Cadence (1990), Biloxi Blues (1988), Heartbreak Ridge (1986) and Full Metal Jacket (1987).', u'Rick Baker created the ""Alfred E. Neuman"" masks used in the beginning and end of the film.', u""Up the Academy (1980) has a tie to X-Men: Apocalypse (2016). Oliver, in this film, was played by J. Hutchison. J. Hutchison is Parker Stevenson's brother. J. Hutchison is now known as Hutch Parker, and is a 20th Century Fox executive. He was one of the producers of X-Men: Apocalypse (2016), and there is an inside joke with this movie playing at the movie theater in X-Men: Apocalypse (2016), even though it takes place in 1983, and this movie came out in 1980.""]","[u'USA::6 June 1980 (New York City, New York)', u'West Germany::17 February 1986 (video premiere)']",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
