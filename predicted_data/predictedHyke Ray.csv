Karloff and Chaney were given the chance to don their famous Universal Frankenstein Monster and Wolf Man make-up for the first time in decades.', u'Although the series was called ""Route 66"" many of the episodes were set in areas in the United States which Route 66 did not travel through. For example, Route 66 begins in Chicago and ends in L.A., but two episodes were shot in New England, one in Maine (Year 4, episode 2, Same Picture, Different Frame) and one in Vermont (year 4, episode 3, Come Out, Come Out, Wherever you are) - both aired in the fall of 1963 and starred Martin Milner and Glenn Corbett.', u""According to Glenn Corbett, none of the episodes he appeared in were shot along the real Route 66. When he asked the producers why, he was told that the scenery along the actual highway wasn't considered interesting enough."", u'The show was originally to be called The Searchers, which would have made a lot more sense, but producers feared there would be confusion with the very popular John Wayne western by that name that came out four years earlier.', u'Martin Milner and George Maharis were reunited in the 1977 TV movie SST: Death Flight.', u'Three future movie stars nearly became regulars on this series. When the show was first getting off the ground, a young unknown named Robert Redford auditioned for the role of Tod Stiles, but was beaten out by Martin Milner. When George Maharis left the show in late 1962, the producers searched for a replacement. Burt Reynolds was approached, but he was then involved on the show Gunsmoke playing Quint Asper. Another actor who did want to do the series was future Academy Award winner Robert Duvall, who was even auditioned in one episode. The producers felt that Duvall was not handsome enough, however, and went with Glenn Corbett instead.', u""George Maharis walked off the show during the third season during a bout with hepatitis, although it has been alleged that he was dissatisfied with his contract and wanted to work in film, and that he had ongoing clashes with the show's producers. He was replaced by Glenn Corbett, but audiences did not like the change and the show was canceled as a result."", u'Milner drove 1962 Vette during show run.', u'Throughout the series there are numerous references to Tod having attended college at Yale, but did he graduate? In the last episode of Season 2 ({2-32} ""From An Enchantress Fleeing"") Tod mentions that he ""ended his studies after his third year in 1960 and did not finish"".', u'The original pilot of this series aired as an episode of Naked City (1958) titled ""Four Sweet Corners"". Maharis played Johnny Gary and Robert Morris played Link Ridgeway. Morris died before the series was picked up.', u""The series' writers traveled around the U.S. looking for locations to write episodes about. Every episode was filmed on location."", u'Maharis became ill after filming the episode ""Even Stones Have Eyes,"" in which he spent hours in a freezing river. His illness worsened after filming ""There I Am - There I Always Am"" in which he spent hours in the cold water off Catalina Island. Maharis continued to work on the series as he was not allowed to take a break from filming to recover. He eventually contracted hepatitis from an injection given to him by a doctor brought in by the studio and had to take time off for his health. Maharis returned after a month but suffered a relapse. He finally decided to leave the series rather than risk his health any further. Executive producer Herbert B. Leonard sued Maharis for breach-of-contract which was settled out of court. Glenn Corbett was cast as Maharis\' replacement and Buz was never mentioned again.', u'The planned fifth season would have taken place in Europe. It would have been the first American series to be filmed overseas. But the series was cancelled after the fourth season. I Spy (1965) eventually became the first American series to do so.', u""The Corvette was replaced every 3000 miles. Chevrolet was the show's sponsor. It was never explained how Tod was able to get a new Corvette so often."", u'The Corvette was never red as often believed. It was light blue in the first season, beige in the second season, and tan in the third season. The colors were chosen because they photographed well in black and white.', u'Nat \'King\' Cole\'s song ""(Get Your Kicks on) Route 66"" was considered for the show\'s theme. But CBS wanted an original theme to avoid paying the expensive royalties for Cole\'s song. Nelson Riddle\'s ""Route 66 Theme"" hit #30 on the Billboard Hot 100 and was nominated for two Grammys. George Maharis recorded a version of Cole\'s song as a tribute.', u'The series was designed as essentially an anthology that had the main two characters of the series in all the stories.']","[u'USA::7 October 1960', u'Finland::28 December 1961']",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

He was already musically talented, having inherited his ability from his parents. As rock-n-roll was starting to grow and Ricky\'s interest in the music grew, he kept asking father Ozzie Nelson to let him play on the show. Initially, Ozzie resisted until he realized that it was an opportunity to take advantage of Ricky\'s growth as a ""teen idol"" and would thereby help the show\'s popularity. Ricky first sang a cover of Fats Domino\'s ""I\'m Walking"" on the episode ""Ricky the Drummer"" and soon afterward more episodes were tailored around showcasing Ricky\'s talents. However, not everyone was pleased with his foray into Rock-n-Roll. Most parents in America were still concerned that rock would be a bad influence on their children and many wrote letters to Ozzie and Harriet Nelson protesting their allowing their son to take part in the music. The Nelsons dealt with the furor by injecting moments in the episodes in which Ozzie and/or Harriet would offer a sound and practical reasoning for supporting their son\'s music. With that, the furor died down and Ricky went on to become a major rocker with hits like ""It\'s Late"", ""Traveling Man"" and ""Hello, Mary Lou"".', u'The character \'Ozzie Nelson\' was ranked #21 in TV Guide\'s list of the ""50 Greatest TV Dads of All Time"" (20 June 2004 issue).', u""'The Ozzie & Harriet Show' was cancelled in 1966.

Neal later became a pro-life activist.', u'The movie was filmed on a low budget. As a result nearly all the shots of the submarines, ships and the action scenes were stock footage from World War II.', u'John Wayne was dissatisfied with the finished film, believing it to be overlong and containing too much romance. He was also opposed from the beginning to the casting of Patricia Neal, whom he felt was too young at 24 for the role of his ex-wife.', u""John Wayne and Patricia Neal did not get along during filming. She was particularly annoyed by his treatment of a gay publicity man. Nearly fourteen years later, however, they worked together on In Harm's Way (1965) where she noted that he had mellowed a lot, possibly because he was seriously ill with lung cancer at the time."", u'The problems with submarine torpedoes shown in the movie are accurate. A poorly designed and tested firing pin could malfunction on a good hit (that is, a torpedo striking within about 45 degrees of perpendicular to the side of the target). Poor hits (at a very sharp angle to the side of the ship) could often produce more reliable explosions. Finding the problem, while not performed by the submarine crews as shown, actually did occur in a similar manner.', u'The rescue of the women and children is based upon an incident involving the USS Crevalle. The sub took 40 refugees off Negros Island in the Philippines including women, children and some survivors of the Bataan Death March. The rescue was just a cover story. The real reason the sub was sent there was to retrieve a group of important documents, namely the Japanese ""Z plan"", found by the local guerrilla unit from the crash of a plane carrying the chief of staff of the Japanese Combined Fleet.', u'This movie\'s opening foreword and dedication states: ""When the Pacific Fleet was destroyed by the Japanese sneak attack on Pearl Harbor, it remained for the submarines to carry the war to the enemy. In the four years that followed, our undersea craft sank six million tons of Japanese shipping including some of the proudest ships of the Imperial Navy. Fifty-two of our submarines and thirty-five hundred officers and men were lost. It is to these men and the entire \'silent service\' that this picture is humbly dedicated.""', u'Ward Bond\'s character is based upon Cmd. Howard Gilmore, captain of the USS Growler. While attacking a Japanese convoy, the USS Growler rammed a Japanese convoy escort, which was attempting to ram her. The Japanese crew fired upon the bridge killing two and wounding Gilmore and two others. Gilmore ordered ""Clear the bridge."" Realizing that he could not get below in time for the ship to escape, Gilmore shouted ""Take her down!"" As in the movie, the crew later surfaced, but could not find Gilmore. For his sacrifice, Gilmore was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor.', u""Wayne's navy cap from the film was sold by Texas-based Heritage Auctions for $10,755."", u""The bootleg liquor mentioned during the jail scene that the characters call ooh-koo-lee-how is actually okolehao (o-koh-leh-how). It's a Hawaiian moonshine based on the root of ti plants and a sugar substance like sugar cane or pineapples. Okolehao means iron bottom or iron buttocks. Derived by the two iron pots used for cooking ti mash on whaling ships. The pots were usually placed side by side, resembling a part of the human anatomy."", u'Filmed almost entirely in the studio.', u'Although the US and UK governments and the media portrayed the attack on Pearl Harbor as a ""sneak"" attack, the Japanese government had already broken off negotiations with the United States. There was a slight delay in translating the message, which meant it arrived half an hour after the attack on the naval base had started. Declarations of war were largely rendered obsolete after World War II by the United Nations Charter, although they were already being phased out in 1941. The Soviet Union did not declare war on Poland before launching its invasion of the country in 1939. Adolf Hitler deliberately did not declare war on the Soviet Union when he launched Operation Barbarossa on 22 June 1941. Japan did not declare war before launching a pre-emptive strike on Russian warships at the naval base of Port Arthur in 1904, which began the Russo-Japanese War. There were no declarations of war when the British invaded Iceland in 1940, or when the British and Soviets invaded Iran in 1941. In December 2011 a declassified memorandum from the Office of Naval Intelligence showed President Franklin D. Roosevelt was warned three days before the attack that the Japanese empire was eyeing up Hawaii with a view to ""open conflict.""', u'Opening credits: The story, all names, characters and incidents portrayed in this production are fictitious.

Frank Sinatra recorded the song as ""It Can\'t Be Wrong"" in 1943.', u'The film traded for with the supply ship and shown to the crew is Destination Tokyo with Cary Grant.', u'When the submarine Thunderfish (John Wayne\'s sub) pulls alongside to transfer spare parts to the submarine Corvena, they also exchange movies. The Thunderfish sends over George Washington Slept Here (1942), starring Jack Benny, Ann Sheridan, and Charles Coburn. The ""submarine picture"" that the Corvena sends over is Destination Tokyo (1943), starring Cary Grant, John Garfield, and Alan Hale. Shortly thereafter, the Thunderfish encounters floating wreckage, including the reel cases for George Washington Slept Here (1942), thus confirming the wreckage was that of the sub Corvena.']","[u'USA::27 January 1951', u'Denmark::4 July 1951', u'UK::13 August 1951', u'Sweden::20 August 1951', u'Finland::23 November 1951', u'Portugal::6 June 1952', u'Philippines::8 July 1952 (Davao)', u'Turkey::September 1952', u'Spain::9 March 1953 (Madrid)', u'Australia::15 May 1953', u'West Germany::12 June 1953', u'Austria::August 1953', u'Japan::4 October 1959']",0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The real Ringo was a ruthless murderer and survivor of the infamous gunfight at the OK Corral, against (Dr.) John Holliday, Wyatt Earp and the Earp brothers. Also unlike the movie's account, the actual John Ringo--his real name--suffered a severe bout of melancholy following a visit to his family in California in July of 1882 and went on a monumental ten-day alcoholic binge, which climaxed when he sat down under an oak tree, drew his gun and used it to commit suicide."", u'The original story was written by John Bowers and Andr\xe9 De Toth with John Wayne in mind. Wayne loved it and offered Bowers $10,000 for it. The writer thought it was worth more and told Wayne how he felt. The actor reportedly said, ""Well, you wrote it for me. Don\'t you have any artistic integrity?"" Bowers later got $70,000 for it at Fox, and Wayne harboured ill-feelings about the incident, accusing Bowers of selling it out from under him. In addition, Wayne refused to work for Columbia Pictures because its chief, Harry Cohn, had mistreated him years before when he was a young contract player. Cohn had bought the project for Wayne, but Wayne\'s grudge was too deep, and Cohn sold the script to Twentieth Century Fox, which cast Gregory Peck in the role Wayne badly wanted but for which he refused to bend. When the Reno Chamber of Commerce named Peck the top western star for 1950 and presented him with the Silver Spurs award, an angry Wayne said, ""Well, who the hell decided that you were the best cowboy of the year?"". Wayne\'s final film, The Shootist (1976), is very similar to this film.', u'The large painting on the wall behind Gregory Peck\'s chair in the barroom is ""Custer\'s Last Fight"", painted in 1884 by Cassily Adams and reproduced as a lithographic print by Otto Becker from Adams\' original painting. These prints were distributed in 1896 to bars and taverns all over America by the Anheuser Busch Co.', u'The studio hated Gregory Peck\'s authentic period mustache. In fact, the head of production at Fox, Spyros P. Skouras, was out of town when production began. By the time he got back, so much of the film had been shot that it was too late to order Peck to shave it off and re-shoot. After the film did not do well at the box office, Skouras ran into Peck and he reportedly said, ""That mustache cost us millions"".', u'In the original ending Hunt Bromley was arrested by the sheriff, but studio chief Darryl F. Zanuck was so enraged at this resolution that director Henry King and writer Nunnally Johnson concocted the ending where Bromley is beaten up by the sheriff and let go. That satisfied Zanuck more.', u'The western street in this film is the same one used in The Ox-Bow Incident (1943).', u'""Screen Director\'s Playhouse"" broadcast a 60 minute radio adaptation of the movie on June 7, 1951 with Gregory Peck reprising his film role.', u'Bob Dylan\'s 1986 song ""Brownsville Girl,"" co-written with Sam Shepard, alludes to watching Gregory Peck in this film. Peck himself thanked Dylan publicly when he delivered the speech when Dylan was given his Kennedy Center award in 1997.', u'In 1996, veteran character actor Richard Jaeckel, who played ""Eddie"", was diagnosed with cancer at the same time his wife had Alzheimer\'s disease. The Jaeckels had lost their Brentwood (CA) home, were over $1 million in debt and Jaeckel was basically homeless. His family tried unsuccessfully to place him into the Motion Picture and Television Hospital in Woodland Hills, CA. Peck lobbied for Jaeckel\'s admittance, and three days later Jaeckel was placed in the facility. He stayed in the hospital until his death in June 1997.', u'Filmmaker John Singleton has cited this film as influencing him more than any other film.', u""Opening credits: In the Southwest of the 1880's the difference between death and glory was often but a fraction of a second. This was the speed that made champions of Wyatt Earp, Billy the Kid, and Wild Bill Hickok. But the fastest man with a gun who ever lived, by many contemporary accounts, was a long, lean Texan named Ringo."", u'The theme music used in the trailer for this film is actually the theme from Yellow Sky (1948), also starring Gregory Peck.', u'This marked the return of Jean Parker to films after a five-year absence.', u""Cinematographer Charles G.

Savage (inspired by Gen. Frank Armstrong), many characters in this film were based on real-life people. Maj. Gen. Pat Prichard (played by Millard Mitchell) is based on Maj. Gen. Ira C. Eaker, first commander of the 8th Bomber Command. Col. Keith Davenport (Gary Merrill) is based on Col. Charles B. Overacker, first commander of the 306th Bomb Group. Lt. Jessie Bishop (Robert Patten) is based on Lt. John Morgan, a B-17 co-pilot who received the Congressional Medal of Honor for landing his plane after his pilot was severely wounded during a bombing run. Maj. Joe Cobb (John Kellogg) is based on Maj. (later Col.) Paul Tibbets, who later became famous as the pilot of the B-29 ""Enola Gay"" which dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima in 1945 (Tibbets himself served as a technical advisor for this movie). Sgt. McIlhenny (Robert Arthur) is based on Sgt. Donald Bevan, who was shot down over Germany in 1943 and became a POW. Bevan later co-wrote the play Stalag 17 (1953), with fellow POW Edmund Trzcinski, based on their prison camp experiences.', u'Writer Sy Bartlett was the first American to drop a bomb over Nazi Germany.', u""A highly unusual film in its day in that it has no musical underscore.

It\'s sitting on a wire-frame shelving unit in one of the ""Dolls"" apartments.', u'Gregory Peck was a vocal opponent of the aerial bombing of cities in Germany, Japan, North Korea and Vietnam.', u'Although ostensibly set in England, most of the film was actually shot in the USA. This would explain why the general is driven around in cars that are clearly left hand drive instead of right hand drive as they are in the UK.', u""Darryl F. Zanuck paid out the unprecedented fee of $100,000 for the rights to Sy Bartlett and Beirne Lay Jr.'s book. The chief reason for this is said to be because Zanuck had gotten wind that William Wyler was interested in the property for Paramount. Zanuck made sure that he had the co-operation of the United States Air Force before he went ahead with the deal."", u""Gregory Peck initially turned down the script, feeling that it was too similar to the then-popular play/ film Command Decision (1948). One of the reasons why he changed his tune was because he was highly impressed with 20th Century Fox house director, Henry King. Although they had never worked together before, Peck found King's empathy with the material and his cast and crew to be highly appealing. The two would go on to make 5 more films together: The Gunfighter (1950), David and Bathsheba (1951), The Snows of Kilimanjaro (1952), The Bravados (1958) and Beloved Infidel (1959)."", u'Because of the constant noise in the planes air crew wore ""throat mics"". These had two pickups that sat against the larynx (vocal cords) and picked the sound up directly from them. You will notice that whenever a crew member speaks he puts his hand up against the mic and presses it against his throat. This helped insure good sound pickup.', u'After reading the completed script, officers at the Pentagon were uncomfortable about Savage\'s breakdown under excessive strain, saying they would ""prefer not to indicate to the public that a commanding general...became as irrational as indicated."" Such a high-ranking officer might suffer from ""physical ailments, nervousness, short temper or just plain fatigue, but he would never ""burst out hysterically or have a complete mental collapse."" The screenplay was modified to give Savage a quieter, more subtle breakdown. Other revisions made at the Air Force\'s request included toning down the heavy drinking and having the chaplain watch other men playing poker, not joining in the game himself.', u'Gregory Peck wanted the film to be much more strongly anti-war.', u'""Twelve O\'Clock High"" is an example of a pilot\'s enemy position call. During World War II pilots would call-out the positions of enemy airplanes by referring to their bearings via the use of a pretend face of a clock. In this case, 12 O\'Clock meant the enemy was directly ahead, whereas 6 O\'Clock would mean directly behind. ""High"" or ""Low"" referred to whether the enemy was above or below the airplane respectively. ""Even"" meant that the enemy was level with the pilot\'s plane.', u'When Gen. Savage (Gregory Peck) gets back from his last mission, the one before he cracks up, he\'s in his room with Col. Davenport (Gary Merrill), Gately (Hugh Marlowe) and a drunk Col. Stovall (Dean Jagger). Davenport asks Savage if he knows that the ""Old Man"" went along on the just finished mission. After Savage tells him he didn\'t know, Davenport continues, ""He slipped into Curt May\'s plane"". During the era when this movie takes place, Maj. Curtis LeMay (later to become a general and eventually Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff) was flying bombing missions as commander of a B-17 Flying Fortress unit, the 305th Bomb Group, which was part of the Eighth Air Force.', u'Robert Arthur (Sgt. McIllhenny) was the final cast member who received billing in the original film credits to die, in 2008 at the age of 83.', u'The 306th Bomb Group, on which the fictional 918th is based, was the first USAAF group to strike Germany during World War II. This occurred on 27 January 1943. The target was the battleship ""Admiral Scheer"" in the harbor of Wilhelmshaven. Col. Frank Armstrong, on whom the character of Gen. Savage is based, was in the lead plane on that mission. The lead bombardier was Lt. Frank Yaussi.', u""Many of the detailed accounts in the movie are true, and based on the experiences of veterans Bartlett and Lay. The scene where the 918th ignores the radio recall and presses on to bomb the target is true. The 94th BG, based at Bury St. Edmunds, ignored a recall order on their way to Brunswick, Germany, and pressed on to the target alone, their accompanying groups having turned back. The Group commander later said they had fought most of the way to the target, and lost 1/3 of their aircraft at that point. Instead of a reprimand, the 94th Group was given the highest group award, what is now known as the Presidential Unit Citation. The account where the pilot fought the wounded co-pilot's thrashing for hours was also true, and the pilot was awarded a Medal of Honor for saving his crew."", u'The opening credits film\'s dedication states: ""This motion picture is humbly dedicated to those Americans, both living and dead, whose gallant effort made possible daylight precision bombing. They were the only Americans fighting in Europe in the fall of 1942. They stood alone, against the enemy and against doubts from home and abroad. This is THEIR story.""', u'""The Screen Guild Theater"" broadcast another 60 minute radio adaptation of the movie on April 12, 1951 with Gregory Peck and Hugh Marlowe again reprising their film roles.', u""Paul Mantz, Hollywood's leading stunt pilot, was paid the then-unprecedented sum of $4,500 to crash-land a B-17 bomber for one early scene in the film. Frank Tallman, Mantz' partner in Tallmantz Aviation, wrote in his autobiography that, while many B-17s had been landed by one pilot, as far as he knew this flight was the first time that a B-17 ever took off with only one pilot and no other crew; nobody was sure that it could be done. The footage was used again in The War Lover (1962)."", u'Although the Air Force began locating B-17s for use in the film soon after the studio purchased the novel, they withheld full cooperation from Twentieth Century-Fox until receiving a script.', u""The film's release was delayed because MGM's Command Decision (1948) beat 20th Century-Fox to the punch.

King visited Eglin AFB on March 8, 1949 and found an ideal location for principal photography several miles north of the main base at its Eglin AFB Auxiliary Field No. 3, better known as Duke Field, where the mock installation with 15 buildings (including a World War II control tower) were constructed to simulate RAF Archbury. The film\'s technical advisor, Colonel John deRussy, was stationed at Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama at the time, and suggested Ozark Army Air Field near Daleville, Alabama (now known as Cairns Army Airfield, adjacent to Fort Rucker). King chose Cairns as the location for filming B-17 takeoffs and landings, including the B-17 belly-landing sequence, since the light-colored runways at Eglin did not match wartime runways in England which had been black to make them less visible to enemy aircraft. When the crew arrived at Cairns, it was also considered as an ""ideal for shots of Harvey Stovall reminiscing about his World War II service"" since the field was somewhat overgrown.', u'Darryl F. Zanuck intentionally held up production of the film due to concern over the low public interest in war films.', u'When the brass is monitoring the progress of the ball bearing mission, they hear about the heavy number of German fighters impeding the progress of the mission. Someone then announces that fighters have been ordered to ram bombers in order to stop them. This was an actual tactic used by Germany toward the end of the war, in 1945. They thought the psychological affect would keep bomber pilots from wanting to fly ... it did not have that effect. The way it was supposed to work, the German pilot was to dive or fly head-on toward a bomber, but then bail out just prior to impact ... Not too soon and the plane would veer off and too late the pilot would not live to fly another day. Called ""Sonderkommando Elbe"" by the Germans, who claim it brought down approx. 24 bombers. At first they used standard fighters, but then later when they introduced their jet, they designed a version with reinforced wings, not to dogfight, but again to ram, slicing thru bomber wings.', u'Major Harvey Stovall character is based on WWI ace William Howard Stovall.

Quincannon (Victor McLaglen) is addressing the troops and warning them to ""watch them words,"" he asks who owns a dog that had wandered over and was watching the assembled soldiers. Not receiving an answer, he concludes, ""Nice dog! Irish setter!"" The scene was improvised on the spot by director John Ford. The dog was an unnamed Navajo pet that had fallen asleep during the setup. Multiple takes were required because McLaglen kept blowing the line, calling the dog a ""cocker spaniel.""', u'John Ford initially was uncertain who to cast in the lead role. However, he knew that he did not want John Wayne for the part-considering, among other factors, that Wayne would be playing a character over twenty years older than he was at the time. Reportedly, Wayne\'s performance in Red River (1948) changed Ford\'s mind, causing him to exclaim, ""I didn\'t know the big son of a bitch could act!"" Ford realized Wayne had grown considerably as an actor, and was now capable of playing the character he envisaged for this film. When shooting was completed, Ford presented Wayne with a cake with the message, ""You\'re an actor now.""', u""Winton C. Hoch filed a protest with the cinematographers' union about overtime involved in being made to shoot the lightning and thunder scenes over the troops. As it turned out, it was these shots that won him an Oscar for cinematography."", u'The horse that Ben Johnson rode in this film was a famous movie horse used by many stars in many 1940s and 1950s westerns. It was a big sorrel stallion called ""Steel"" and was owned by Johnson\'s father-in-law, Clarence ""Fat"" Jones, who ran one of the most successful horse-renting stables in Hollywood. The horse, which was known for being very quiet but flashy, was ridden by John Wayne in Tall in the Saddle (1944) and The Conqueror (1956), Gregory Peck in Yellow Sky (1948) and Randolph Scott in The Tall T (1957). The horse made stars look like good riders and Fat Jones always insisted if ""Steel"" was used in a movie, the company hire every other horse used in the movie from his stable, so ""Steel"" was worth a fortune to him. ""Steel"" had his own double and the horse that Johnson rides in the galloping scenes was not ""Steel"" but a spectacular galloper called ""Bingo"". ""Steel"" was no movie prima donna, however. Johnson also rode him when he won his world champion calf roping title. He also rode both ""Steel"" and ""Bingo"" in Wagon Master (1950).', u""The exterior shots of Capt.

In the opera the motif is connected with the forging of Siegfried\'s sword.', u'In the graveyard, one of the crosses carries the name ""DeVoto"", this is likely an homage to Bernard DeVoto, a prominent historian of the American West.', u'John Wayne named Captain Nathan Brittles as one of his favourite roles.', u""The film was budgeted at $1,851,290, $40,000 less than Fort Apache (1948), and because of John Ford's familiarity with the Monument Valley area, it was completed after only thirty-one days of shooting and was brought in almost $500,000 under budget."", u'Capt. Brittles marks each day off an 1876 calendar with no month, on which the first day is a Wednesday. That would make the month of his ""retirement"" as March of 1876. But it cannot be March as Custer was killed in June 1876. The calendar is wrong for 1876.', u'The second John Ford movie filmed in color.

This led to Ford casting Wayne in more complex roles in films like She Wore a Yellow Ribbon (1949) and The Searchers (1956).', u'Filmed in 1946 but held for release for two years, in part due to legal problems with Howard Hughes who claimed it was similar to his The Outlaw (1943).', u""There was some concern that John Wayne and Montgomery Clift would not get along, since they were diametrically opposed on all political issues, and both were outspoken on their views. According to legend they agreed not to discuss politics and the shooting went smoothly. However, both Wayne and Walter Brennan would not get along with Clift, and they stayed away from the young actor when not filming. Clift later turned down Dean Martin's role in Rio Bravo (1959) because he did not want to be reunited with those two actors."", u'The theme song, ""Settle Down"" was later adapted by the score\'s author, Dimitri Tiomkin, and sung by Dean Martin and Ricky Nelson under the title ""My Rifle, My Pony and Me"" in Rio Bravo (1959), another John Wayne western directed by Howard Hawks.', u'Despite the reputed lack of rain, there were frequent unexpected downpours on location. John Wayne convinced Howard Hawks to shoot in all weather, and the script was rewritten to accommodate a fierce storm.', u'Howard Hawks was distressed by what he considered John Ireland\'s unprofessional and lecherous behavior during filming, which were partially due to the actor\'s alcoholism. This contributed to Ireland\'s part, ""Cherry Valance"", being drastically reduced in the finished film. However, others on the film--notably writer Borden Chase--have said that Hawks\' main problem with Ireland was that that they were both competing for the affections of Joanne Dru and Hawks found himself on the losing end (Ireland and Dru were married a year later) and took out his resentment at his loss on Ireland. Hawks later called Chase ""an idiot,"" a heavy drinker and philanderer who didn\'t know what he was talking about, adding that the real reason he cut Ireland\'s scenes was because the actor was always getting drunk, stoned on marijuana, and losing his hat and gun.', u'Texas Longhorn cattle had been nearly extinct as a breed for about 50 years when this film was made. Only a few dozen animals were available. In the herd scenes most of the cattle are Hereford crosses with the precious Longhorns prominently placed in crucial scenes.', u'John Wayne felt the film was slightly overlong, and was concerned how Montgomery Clift could fight him on screen. Howard Hawks filmed the final fight in such a way that Clift was able to realistically stand up to the much taller and heavier Wayne.', u'This was the only film in which Harry Carey Jr. appeared with his father Harry Carey, although they have no scenes together.', u'Before filming began consideration was given to shooting in color, but Howard Hawks found the processes at that time to be too garish and decided that black-and-white would be more conducive to a feeling of the period.', u'Writer Borden Chase readily admitted that the storyline was Mutiny on the Bounty (1935) with saddles and stirrups.', u'Film debut of Montgomery Clift. NOTE: This film was shelved for two years, so the first film the public saw of Clift was Yksin maailmassa (1948), for which he was Oscar nominated.', u'Burt Lancaster was offered the Montgomery Clift role by agent Charles K. Feldman, who was trying to sign the former acrobat, but Lancaster had just signed with agent Harold Hecht and so turned down the role to star in The Killers (1946), which was his film debut.', u'On the first day of shooting, Montgomery Clift burned himself on the thigh with a blank cartridge practising quick draws.', u'Montgomery Clift was nervous about standing up to John Wayne but gained confidence when Howard Hawks told him to play his scenes like David against Goliath. He also urged the young actor to underplay in his scenes with Wayne, particularly the scene in which his character challenges Dunson for the first time. Wayne was also not sure Clift could be convincing as a rugged cowboy, but after that first confrontation scene he told Hawks his doubts were gone and ""he\'s going to be okay.""', u'Howard Hawks and John Wayne also differed on how Wayne would play the aged Dunson. Hawks thought that beyond the added gray hair and wrinkles, Wayne should move and talk differently and suggested he consult Walter Brennan on techniques for appearing old. Wayne found the shuffling and tottering that Brennan suggested to be detrimental to his character and image and played it his own way, ""standin\' tall."" Wayne did, however, interject some subtle movements to convey his advanced years, such as reaching out for Montgomery Clift\'s assistance in rising to his feet from a crouch. Wayne recalled, ""Oh, yeah, Hawks and I had a few fights along the way, but he accepted me as an expert, which I was, and we did not have any more trouble, and I was always happy to work for Hawks.""', u""In a 1974 interview, Howard Hawks said that he originally offered the role of Thomas Dunson to Gary Cooper but he had declined it because he didn't believe the ruthless nature of Dunson's character would have suited his screen image."", u'Reportedly, upon completing this movie Howard Hawks gave John Wayne a belt buckle that featured the Red River D logo (Wayne later wore this as part of his costume in several other films including El Dorado (1967)). According to this story, Wayne later returned the favor and gave Hawks a twin buckle. However, Hank Worden, who played Sims Reeves, claimed that he had liked the Red River D brand and had had a local silversmith make him a small buckle with the brand (which he also wore in several later films). According to Worden, Wayne saw his buckle, admired it, and asked for the name of the silversmith. Wayne then had matching (larger) buckles made for himself and Hawks.', u'To coordinate the massive movement of actors, crew and cattle, the company depended on short-wave radios and walkie-talkies for communications.', u'Final film of Harry Carey.', u'Montgomery Clift had learned to ride horses while at military prep school, but it was a different kind of riding than he was required to do in this role. He asked experienced Western actor Noah Beery Jr.. for help and worked hard to become convincing on screen. Beery later said, ""The thing he enjoyed most was becoming a hell of a good cowboy and horseman."" Howard Hawks always had high praise for how hard Clift worked on the picture.', u'Howard Hawks said he often thought of John Ford when shooting, particularly in a burial scene when ominous clouds started to gather. He told John Wayne to keep talking, say anything, and they would fix the sound later. In the final cut the scene is played with a big cloud dramatically passing over, and Hawks said he told Ford, ""Hey, I\'ve got one almost as good as you can do--you better go and see it.""', u'Howard Hawks shot the beginning of the cattle drive in close-ups of each of the principal cowhands because he felt tight shots would be needed to help the audience keep all the characters straight in their minds. To that end, he also gave them all different kinds of hats, including a derby. Montgomery Clift used Hawks\' own hat, which was given to him by Gary Cooper. Cooper had imparted a weather-beaten look to the hat by watering it every night. ""Spiders built nests in it,"" Hawks said. ""It looked great.""', u'Montgomery Clift didn\'t warm to either Howard Hawks or John Wayne. He did occasionally take part in the nightly poker games that they organized where ""they laughed and drank and told dirty jokes and slapped each other on the back. They tried to draw me into their circle but I couldn\'t go along with them. The machismo thing repelled me because it seemed so forced and unnecessary"".', u'Howard Hawks and his crew scouted more than 15,000 miles of territory in Texas, Arizona, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Mexico before settling on a location. The film was shot on a vast cattle ranch near Elgin, AZ, from June to November 1946. Other locations included the Whetstone Mountains in Arizona and the San Pedro River, standing in for the Red River.', u""This was Howard Hawks' first Western film."", u'In an interview with Life Magazine, John Wayne described Montgomery Clift as ""an arrogant little bastard"".', u'Howard Hawks claimed the problem with the one scene that invites criticism, the ending, was not the scene itself but the way Joanne Dru played it.', u""This was 1948's third highest grossing film at $4,150,000. Only Road to Rio (1947) ($4,500,000) and Easter Parade (1948) ($4,200,000) made more."", u'Howard Hawks had great respect for John Wayne, even though many people didn\'t consider him a great actor. ""He\'s a damn good actor. He does everything, and he makes you believe it,"" Hawks later commented.', u'During production, many members of the cast and crew caught illnesses and injuries. Howard Hawks was hospitalized for several days after being stung by a centipede. John Wayne caught a severe cold. Joanne Dru suffered from influenza.', u'John Wayne responded to Montgomery Clift\'s underplaying by working harder at his difficult role. In the scene where Clift tells him he\'s taking over the drive and moving the herd to Abilene, Wayne turned his back on him and said in a low voice, ""I\'m gonna kill you, Matt."" The action was counter to Howard Hawks\' direction to have Wayne cringe, but the actor refused to appear cowardly and played it his way, to Hawks\' ultimate satisfaction. The improvised moment left Clift dumbfounded and was used in the final cut.', u'Ranked #5 on the American Film Institute\'s list of the 10 greatest films in the genre ""Western"" in June 2008.', u""Borden Chase objected to what he considered the historically inaccurate use of six-shooters. Howard Hawks insisted on using them, however, so he didn't have to stop a scene to reload guns."", u'In the shot of Groot driving the chuck wagon across the river, Walter Brennan did the stunt himself.', u'Harry Carey Jr. reputedly played two different roles in the film. One was Dan Latimer, who was killed in the stampede. The other was supposedly later in the movie when he (wearing black vest and hat) and John Wayne stood together and Carey spoke the line, ""They crossed here . . . ""', u'To get the impressive shot of Dunson surveying his vast herd, the camera was placed on a motorized turntable so it always moved at the same speed. The shot began with him at a fencepost and panned across the cattle until it came to another fencepost. The camera was then stopped while the available cattle were moved into the next segment of the shot, then started again. This was repeated until the camera moves back to him, giving the impression that he was looking out at many times more cattle than they actually had on location.', u'The role of Tess Millay was intended for Margaret Sheridan, but she became pregnant shortly before filming. She suggested her friend Joanne Dru for the role.', u'Cary Grant (who had worked with Howard Hawks on Bringing Up Baby (1938) and Only Angels Have Wings (1939)) turned down the role of gunslinger Cherry Valance, a part that was subsequently minimized in the final film.', u""Two sets of costumes were required to cover wear and tear, to a total of $150,000 for the cowboys' wardrobe (Joanne Dru's costumes alone cost more than $20,000). Each actor had two pairs of boots at $150 a pair."", u'Originally budgeted at $500,000, the film eventually cost at least twice that.', u'Howard Hawks originally wanted Gregg Toland as his director of photography. When Toland proved unavailable, he had to go with Russell Harlan instead.', u'""Lux Radio Theater"" broadcast a 60-minute radio adaptation of the movie on March 7, 1949 with John Wayne, Joanne Dru and Walter Brennan reprising their film roles.', u""Several players appeared with John Wayne in a number of films, many of them identified as the John Ford stock company in many of that director's pictures. Hank Worden (Sims Reeves) played a key part as Old Mose in The Searchers (1956) and was in 15 other Wayne movies. Paul Fix made 27 pictures with Wayne between 1931-73. Wayne worked with Harry Carey four times and with his son, Harry Carey Jr., ten times. Noah Beery Jr. and Wayne were in four films together."", u'Harry Carey Jr. (Dan Latimer) was the real-life son of Harry Carey (Mr. Melville) and son-in-law of Paul Fix (Teeler Yacey).', u'Harry Carey Jr. later said that while John Wayne did not personally like Montgomery Clift, he did not deny that Clift was very effective in the film.', u""Montgomery Clift was offered a flat $60,000 for the film, but he had to be talked into doing the role, mostly because of his concern about the climactic fight scene with the bigger and tougher John Wayne. It was a doubt amplified in his mind by several friends who told him he was crazy to play against type. Clift finally agreed to do it at Howard Hawks' urging but refused to sign more than a one-picture deal."", u""In Rio Bravo (1959), Howard Hawks encouraged 19-year-old Ricky Nelson to copy Montgomery Clift's mannerism from this film, rubbing his nose with his index finger."", u""John Wayne gave the producers extensive advice about the possible location and logistical problems associated with making Westerns and insisted Howard Hawks hire real cowhands and trained stunt professionals instead of the amateurs he had lined up. The director ended up signing 70 real cowboys for the job. He also contracted to have dozens of horses represent the hundreds required by the story and about 1000 head of cattle at $10 per day each stand in for Dunson's herd of 10,000. Wayne said once it was clear Hawks was taking his advice seriously and the budget would be increased, he agreed to do the picture."", u'Both the book ""The Celluloid Closet"" and the 1995 documentary made from it (The Celluloid Closet (1995)) referenced thus film as one of the classic Hollywood pictures with veiled homoerotic undertones. Joseph McBride and Gerald Peary, in an interview with Howard Hawks for ""Film Comment"", commented on the gay subtexts of several of the director\'s films, particularly this one. Hawks\' reply was that it was ""a goddamn silly statement to make."" The exchanges between Matt Garth and Cherry Valance have been especially singled out as coded homosexual dialogue. Also, it is rumored that Montgomery Clift and John Ireland had an affair during filming.', u'Montgomery Clift once said ""I watched myself in ""Red River"" and I knew I was going to be famous, so I decided I would get drunk anonymously one last time"".', u'Joanne Dru married fellow co-star John Ireland in 1949. They divorced in 1957.', u'Dams had to be built across the San Pedro River (standing in for the Red River) so it would rise to the appropriate level for shooting, and the 500 actors and extras had to be fitted with duplicate authentic costumes to cover for the substantial wear-and-tear they endured.', u'John Wayne was offered $150,000 and 10% of the profits to play the role of Tom Dunson.', u'Howard Hawks cast Montgomery Clift in the film after seeing him in ""The Searching Wind"" on Broadway.', u""Blink and you'll miss a couple of future stars in bit parts. Shelley Winters can be glimpsed as a dance hall girl in the second wagon train. Richard Farnsworth plays one of Dunson's men. He was also a stuntman on the picture.

Feldman and expressed his concerns with their approach to the film. The first thing he suggested was that they get United Artists to up the $1.5-million budget by more than 50%, since their intentions were clearly to make a blockbuster.', u'The film bears some resemblance to Come and Get It (1936), a film Howard Hawks began that was taken over by William Wyler. In both films, there is a conflict between an older and younger man, father and foster son figures, who end up competing for the same woman; in that film, the Frances Farmer character is a surrogate for the woman the older man loved and lost years before.', u'More than 9,000 steers were photographed for the herd drive, requiring 25,000 gallons of water to settle the dust they kicked up.', u'The song Dean Martin sings in the jail in Rio Bravo (1959) was originally written by Dimitri Tiomkin for this film, but it was completed too late for use in the scene where a cowboy song was needed, so they substituted another one. However, strains of the song can be heard in the theme music, and the words were changed for use in the later movie.', u""Although not released until September 1948, it became the year's third biggest moneymaker, earning more than $4 million on its first run."", u'At the start of filming, John Wayne had serious doubts if Montgomery Clift would be manly enough to play a character that stood up to him.

He respected them and they enjoyed working for him. They loved it when a movie was being shot anywhere nearby because it meant work. They would travel many miles by wagon for a job, and knew they could count on a big lunch on a Ford set. The movie required 200 Navajos as Apache warriors and another 100 Navajo women and children.

His biographer Peter Collier asserts that ""the ramrod cavalry martinet he played in John Ford\'s \'Fort Apache\' was perhaps closest to his off-screen personality at this time.""', u'Although Henry Fonda would work with John Ford nine times over the course of their careers, the actor found the director\'s unwillingness to rehearse emotional scenes frustrating. He noted how if he wanted to discuss a scene, Ford would just change the subject or tell him to shut up. Fonda also never became comfortable with Ford\'s foul language and bullying ways. ""I literally saw tears coming out of Henry Fonda\'s eyes on [this film],"" Michael Wayne recalled.

The two used to tease him mercilessly about what they said was the enormous size of his rear end. The burly, rough-edged Bond harbored ambitions of becoming a romantic lead, much to everyone\'s amusement, and kept complaining throughout the picture that he should have been playing Wayne\'s role.

He was concerned about a scene of the men working at a manure pile as possibly offensive and insisted that a shot of two dead troopers be handled discreetly without any overt gruesomeness. He also gave orders that no toilet should be shown on screen and that drinking scenes be kept to a minimum. Breen also instructed John Ford to keep constant contact with Mel Morse, regional director of the American Humane Society, regarding any scenes involving horses or other animals.', u'Although they would work together on 11 pictures, John Ford and Frank Nugent did not establish the same close relationship Ford had with Dudley Nichols, nor did Ford have the same level of respect for Nugent, even though Nugent married Ford\'s daughter. ""Once the script is finished, the writer had better keep out of his way,"" Nugent said. ""The finished picture is always Ford\'s, never the writer\'s."" Nevertheless, Ford was lucky to receive both Nugent\'s and Merian C. Cooper\'s contributions to the project. According to screenwriter Philip Dunne, who worked with Ford on How Green Was My Valley (1941), ""Ford doesn\'t really understand scripts. He has no story sense. He has a great sense of scenes. But Ford should never be the producer of his pictures.""', u'""Screen Director\'s Playhouse"" broadcast a 30-minute radio adaptation of the movie on August 5, 1949 with John Wayne and Ward Bond reprising their film roles.', u'Realizing that John Ford needed expert, fast-paced editing to make his pictures work, producer Merian C. Cooper managed to get Ford to turn over control of this and other films once principal photography was over.', u'John Ford hired two doctors from Los Angeles to oversee his 600-person crew at Monument Valley, where the company worked in 135-degree heat.', u""The film's original budget was $2.8 million, and for their work, Shirley Temple, John Wayne and Henry Fonda were each paid $100,000, while Victor McLaglen received $75,000."", u'John Ford fired actor/director Paul Fix while the crew was filming in Monument Valley. The writer hired a University of Arizona anthropology student as his guide. After he returned, Ford asked him if he thought he had gathered enough information. When Nugent answered yes, Ford told him, ""Good. Now forget everything you\'ve read and we\'ll start writing a movie.""', u'John Ford had previously directed Shirley Temple and Victor McLaglen in Wee Willie Winkie (1937).', u'While Frank Nugent completed the script, John Ford went scouting locations in Monument Valley. Fully aware that he needed a moneymaker to keep Argosy solvent, Ford spent six months carefully planning a shooting script and pre-production set-ups so that he was able to cut his budget from $2.8 million to $2.1 million and shorten the planned shooting schedule from 77 days to 44.', u'Ben Johnson, who plays Sgt. Tyree in She Wore a Yellow Ribbon (1949) and Trooper Tyree in Rio Grande (1950), also appears in this film, though not as an actor. A former rodeo rider described as ""the best horseman in Hollywood"", Johnson was Henry Fonda\'s stunt double in this movie.', u'This film was shot in 1947, and the period in which it was set--the 1880s--was only about 70 years prior to that. So it is conceivable that veterans of the Apache Wars of that period could have seen this film when it was released.', u'John Ford made certain that the story included several Irish characters; he wanted to include ""a bit of Americana"" by depicting the type of Irish-American who headed west after the Civil War.', u'After his work on the film, Ben Johnson was signed as a ""termer"" by John Ford and Merian C. Cooper and went on to appear in several other Ford westerns, including 3 Godfathers (1948), She Wore a Yellow Ribbon (1949) and Wagon Master (1950).', u""As preparation for writing the film's script, John Ford had Frank Nugent read 50 books about the story's period and setting and sent him to Arizona to study Apache culture."", u""George O'Brien, an old friend of John Ford's who had starred in his silent The Iron Horse (1924), came out of retirement to play the fort commander replaced by Henry Fonda in this story."", u""First assistant cameraman William H.

Just as Fred Derry did in the movie, Wyler flew in B-17s in combat over Germany, although rather than being a bombardier, as Derry was, Wyler shot footage for documentary films (his hearing was permanently damaged when an anti-aircraft shell exploded near his plane while on a bombing raid). Additionally, he modeled the reunion of Al and Milly, in which they first see each other at opposite ends of a long hallway, on his own homecoming to his wife, Margaret Tallichet.', u'In 1946 this became the most successful film at the box office since Gone with the Wind (1939) which was released 7 years earlier.', u""Harold Russell's character was originally written as a war veteran suffering from combat trauma.

Mayo filmed both of the above movies simultaneously -- sometimes shooting scenes from both on the same day.', u'According to his biographer A. Scott Berg, producer Samuel Goldwyn re-released the film in a modified format to play on wide screens. It opened with all the hoopla of a new picture, including a gala premiere in Washington, DC, on February 3, 1954, with Sherman Adams, five Supreme Court justices, two cabinet members and 24 senators in attendance.
