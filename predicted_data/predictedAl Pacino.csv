The phrase refers to famed Major League Baseball manager, Billy Martin. Despite his talents as a manager (he led the New York Yankees to two World Series titles), Martin\'s fiery temper, fueled by his alcoholism, often got him into trouble and as a result, he was fired multiple times. Despite his character flaws, Billy Martin was always being given a ""second chance"".', u'The special scent that Linus puts on his neck to seduce Abigail is noted in a title card as ""The Gilroy."" This is an in-joke on Tony Gilroy who wrote the screenplays for The Bourne Identity (2002), The Bourne Supremacy (2004), and The Bourne Ultimatum (2007), all starring Matt Damon, and also wrote and directed Michael Clayton (2007), which stars George Clooney and is produced by Steven Soderbergh.', u'Matt Damon\'s brief scene on a London street corner is very reminiscent of the Bourne movies: hand-held camera, European location, cell phone use, even the dialogue (""I\'ve used four identities...

When the shot pans over to George Clooney, the number ""5150"" is displayed next to him. This corresponds to the health and safety code for placing a psychiatric hold on a deranged individual. In other words, a crazy person is often referred to as a ""5150"" around police and medical circles.', u'When the pit boss is leaving the pawn shop, he passes by a sign showing the word ""Griffin"".

The Ocean\'s Trilogy & The Iron Man Trilogy, he also did in ""Iron Man 2"".', u'Linus tells Reuben that Rusty is pulling an ""Irwin Allen"". This is in homage to the producer Irwin Allen who is widely popular for his disaster movies and TV shows that depicted ways the world would end. His one technical contribution to the world of film and TV was his pioneering of the ""shaky-cam"" technique to imply aerial turbulence or an earthquake. His approach was to simply tilt the camera back and forth, and have his actors throw themselves across a set. This goes along with Rusty telling Bank there is a possibility of an earthquake, and their exit plan for the end of the movie to cause one to get all the people to leave with their winnings.', u'The characters make several references to a ""Susan B. Anthony"" in their heist. This is a reference to the Susan B. Anthony dollar manufactured by the US mint in 1979. It was similar in appearance and size to a regular quarter and many people dropped it into a slot machine without realizing what it was worth. This method was used twice in the film, though the people are using an ordinary coin they don\'t realize that it will be worth millions in the slot: first by the woman in The Bank who wins the jackpot and later by the VUP at the slot machine in the airport.', u""All members of the Caldwell (Linus') family that we know of have impersonated some kind of law-enforcing agent in the three 'Ocean' movies.

Adamson was a retired police officer, whom Michael Mann had been working with off and on since the film Thief (1981) starring James Caan (and based upon the career of famed Chicago burglar Frank Hohimer whom Adamson had arrested). They had later worked together on two shows produced by Mann: Miami Vice (1984) and Crime Story (1986). According to Chuck Adamson (and confirmed by Michael Mann) in the Heat-Special Edition DVD Documentary ""Crime Stories"", McCauley was a professional robber, with whom he had frequently crossed paths. Events, such as the scene between Vincent Hanna and Neil McCauley in the coffee shop, where they basically tell each other that the next time they meet will be their last, and the warehouse sting, where McCauley got tipped off that the cops were around, due to an officer making a noise really happened. In real-life, Neil McCauley was killed during a robbery of a grocery store (similar to the bank heist shoot-out) by Adamson\'s team, who were tipped off to the robbery.', u'The scene where Vincent catches his wife cheating, removes the television set, and later throws it from his car, was lifted from a similar scene with Dennis Farina in Crime Story (1986), also produced by Michael Mann.', u""An ending discussed, featured Neil and Vincent shooting and killing each other, instead of Vincent shooting Neil.

A deleted scene explains this: the doctor had approached Neil and wanted 30,000 dollars instead of the usual 15,000 dollars, saying Neil and Chris were wanted criminals and a high-risk factor. Neil then explains to the doctor, that if Chris died from his injuries, he would hunt down the doctor and kill him.', u""The word 'fuck' is used 52 times, mostly by Al Pacino and Robert De Niro."", u'Body count: twenty-one.', u""The shooting at the drive-in movie theater differs in one way between the movie and script drafts: in the drafts, Neil's reflexes cause him to spot the assassin creeping up to the shotgun side window and react accordingly in the nick of time. In this version, Shiherlis is not stationed on the roof of the projection building, but is instead stationed with Cheritto by the exit gate to shoot the driver. The assassin would also beg Neil to kill him afterwards."", u'In a deleted scene, Nate tells Neil that he and Chris will be set up with new lives in Ireland.', u'Moby\'s two contributions to the soundtrack were originally meant to be reversed, his cover of Joy Division\'s ""New Dawn Fades"" was supposed to play over the closing credits and ""God Moving Over the Face of the Waters"" while Hanna pursues McCauley on the freeway. However, Michael Mann felt ""God Moving"" was such a cathartic piece of music, it was more suited to strike up during McCauley\'s death scene, ending the movie.', u'Earlier drafts had Nate getting caught by Hanna, and facing accessory charges, for the armored car robbery and the bank robbery.', u""Hanna's team of detectives and McCauley's crew are mirror images of each other right to the end: The only detective to die is Hanna's No. 2 man, Bosko.

Originally, this would have gone to Schwartz, who is shot in the shoulder by Cheritto.', u""The only thief to not get away from the bank heist is carrying a different model rifle than the others, an Israeli Galil.

He was accused by Italian authorities of being involved in the disappearance of Vatican funds amounting to $1.25 billion. Lucchesi was based on Giulio Andreotti, an Italian politician and former Prime Minister. Gilday was based on Paul Marcinkus, a one-time director of the Vatican Bank who to this day has remained silent about the conspiracy."", u""Michael Corleone's funeral was written and rehearsed, but not shot."", u""The movie provides a fictional explanation for several events surrounding the real-life scandals of the Vatican Bank, from 1978 to 1982. Most notably, the film depicts the alleged murder of Pope John Paul I, who was found dead sitting up in his bed on September 29, 1978, only 33 days after assuming the papacy. Journalist David Yallop has speculated that John Paul I died after drinking poisoned tea (as depicted in the film), the victim of a conspiracy by archbishops and cardinals who were fearful of the new pope's planned reforms for the Vatican Bank (the character of Archbishop Gilday is based on Paul Marcinkus, a Chicago-born archbishop who was the head of the Vatican Bank at the time). Also in the film, the murder of the Swiss banker Frederick Keinszig mirrors the real-life death of Italian banker Roberto Calvi, president of the Banco Ambrosiano. In 1982 the bank--which had strong ties to both the Vatican Bank and the Sicilian Mafia--collapsed largely due to Calvi's shady international money exchanges. On June 18, 1982, Calvi (who had fled Italy to escape indictment) was found hanging from the Blackfriar's Bridge in London, with $15,000 in various currencies in his pocket. His death was first ruled a suicide, then later a murder. In 2005 five people--including two Sicilian gangsters--were indicted for Calvi's murder, but all were acquitted in 2007. Additionally in the film, the Sicilian Don Licio Lucchesi is a loose caricature of former Italian Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti, who had ties to the Sicilian Mafia early in his career but who later turned on them. With Lucchesi's thick glasses and ever-present bodyguard, the caricature of Andreotti would be very recognizable to Italian audiences."", u""Although being credited as one of the three editors, Lisa Fruchtman worked only on the final five minutes of the film, from Mary's murder until Michael's death.""]","[u'USA::12 December 1990 (Beverly Hills, California)\n (premiere)', u'USA::25 December 1990', u'Norway::24 January 1991', u'Germany::18 February 1991 (Berlin International Film Festival)', u'Germany::21 February 1991', u'Austria::22 February 1991', u'Australia::28 February 1991', u'Spain::1 March 1991', u'UK::8 March 1991', u'Ireland::8 March 1991', u'Italy::8 March 1991', u'Japan::8 March 1991', u'Uruguay::8 March 1991', u'Brazil::15 March 1991', u'Finland::15 March 1991', u'Portugal::15 March 1991', u'Sweden::15 March 1991', u'South Korea::16 March 1991', u'Hong Kong::21 March 1991', u'Denmark::22 March 1991', u'Netherlands::22 March 1991', u'Turkey::22 March 1991', u'France::27 March 1991', u'Greece::3 May 1991', u'Hungary::3 May 1991', u'Argentina::16 May 1991', u'Czech Republic::1 January 1993', u'France::8 September 2009 (Deauville Film Festival)', u'Japan::20 November 2010 (Toyohashi Slowtown Cinema Festival)', u'China::20 April 2015 (Beijing International Film Festival)']",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Then the make-up artists sculpted Pruneface\'s wrinkled mug over the life mask to form a second mold from which foam-latex facial parts, also known as appliances, were cast. The appliances were attached to Armstrong\'s face in several sections to the actor\'s face and the make-up session could take up to three hours long to apply.

He had moved to Paris to be away from a plentiful supply of the drug in the U.S.', u'When director Brian De Palma submitted the film to the MPAA, they gave it an ""X rating"".

He yet again made some further cuts and submitted it a third time; yet again it was given an ""X"". De Palma refused to cut the film any further to qualify it for an R. He and producer Martin Bregman arranged a hearing with the MPAA. They brought in a panel of experts, including real narcotics officers, who stated that not only was the film an accurate portrayal of real life in the drug underworld, but ultimately it was an anti-drug film, and should be widely seen. This convinced the arbitrators that the third submitted cut of the film deserved an ""R rating"" by a vote of 18-2. However, De Palma surmised that if the third cut of the film was judged an ""R"" then the very first cut should have been an ""R"" as well. He asked the studio if he could release the first cut but was told that he couldn\'t. However since the Studio execs really didn\'t know the differences between the different cuts that had been submitted, De Palma released the first cut of the film to theaters anyway.

For a scene requiring mock brain-scans of the possessed lead character, he shot a real-life radiologist and his assistant, Paul Bateson. In 1979 Friedkin was planning an adaptation of Gerald Walker\'s novel ""Cruising"", inspired by a real-life serial killer who was carving up ""leather boys"" in the city\'s underground gay bars and dumping their body parts in the Hudson River, wrapped in black plastic bags.

Police traced items of recovered clothing to a shop in Greenwich Village, catering to gays, and distinctive tattoos identified one of the victims as a well known member of the gay community. Because several of the cases involved unidentified persons and there was no confirmed cause of death, the crimes were not officially classified as homicides but were listed as CUPPI\'s--circumstances undetermined pending police investigation.

Charged with the slaying, Paul Bateson, a 38-year-old X-ray technician, confessed to meeting Verrill in a Greenwich Village gay bar. After having sex at Verrill\'s flat, Bateson admitted to crushing his victim\'s skull with a metal skillet, afterward stabbing Verrill in the heart. Convicted of the homicide on March 5, 1979, he was sentenced to a term of 20 years to life in prison. While in custody awaiting trial, Bateson bragged of killing other men ""for fun,"" dismembering their bodies and dropping the bagged remains in the Hudson River. This case inspired the novel upon which this film was based. Detectives were satisfied that Bateson actually was the serial killer they had been looking for, but lack of solid evidence resulted in his not being charged with them.', u'In an effort to make the scenes of gay ""leather bars"" as real as possible, actual leather bars in New York City that catered to gay men were used. These locations are in Manhattan\'s lower West Side neighborhoods in the meat packing district, most of which remain open to this day. The extras in full black leather and chaps, among other provocative sexual attire, were actual patrons of the bars recruited for the scenes a few days before filming began. They were instructed to act as they would normally act in gay bars, but to tone down sexually-oriented activities because of the likelihood these acts would give the film an ""X"" rating.', u'Al Pacino makes his first appearance 15 minutes into the film.', u""Angered over reports of the film's negative portrayal of gay life that leaked out during shooting, activists distributed hundreds of whistles to members of New York City's gay community and encouraged them to spoil exterior filming on city streets by blowing them loudly whenever they spotted a crew from the film shooting on location, a tactic that cost the studio a considerable amount of money that had to be spent on lost production time and post-dubbing."", u""Joe Spinell made this movie before Maniac (1980), playing a brutal, closeted police officer in the early scenes. His character mentions his wife leaving him and moving down to Florida with their young daughter to live with his wife's sister. In real life, Spinell's wife, porn star Jean Jennings, divorced him several weeks before he filmed his scenes and moved to Florida--exactly as his character describes."", u'The L.A. punk band The Germs recorded five or so songs expressly for the soundtrack to this movie, although only ""Lion\'s Share"" was actually used. During the recording sessions, director William Friedkin was so energized by the Germs\' playing that he took to doing the ""pogo"" dance around the engineer\'s booth.', u'During a murder scene in a room at the St. James Hotel where a man is stabbed to death on a bed, director William Friedkin edited in several near-subliminal frames from a gay hardcore movie that can clearly be seen in slow motion on DVD.', u""Most of Karen Allen's performance ended up on the cutting room floor."", u'In addition to protests that occurred when the film was released, the production itself was plagued by demonstrations protesting it. Protesters would clog streets, make lots of noise--in order to ruin live recorded sound--and even climb up on rooftops and shine lights with reflectors down on to the set,k to disrupt the lighting and distract the crew.', u'The plot, about murders of the patrons of gay nightclubs, caused many to protest the release of the film. In fact, organized protests by gay groups were planned on the day the film was released. The public largely ignored the protests.', u'Robert De Niro and Roy Scheider turned down the role of Steve Burns.', u""William Friedkin returned to the project after some well-publicized murders were committed in New York City's gay community were committed. He remembered the project that The French Connection (1971) producer Philip D'Antoni had first talked to him about a few years earlier, which eventually resulted in this film being made."", u'The film was part of a cycle of mainstream Hollywood movies featuring gay partnerships and drag characters. Others included Making Love (1982), Victor Victoria (1982), Partners (1982), Tootsie (1982) and Personal Best (1982).', u'Paul Morrissey was going to direct with Jeff Bridges as Steve Burns and Jan-Michael Vincent as Stuart Richards.', u""William Friedkin initially wasn't interested in the project when producer Philip D'Antoni first brought it to his attention. D'Antoni then tried Steven Spielberg who dropped out when--not surprisingly--none of the major studios were prepared to back it."", u'Throughout the summer of 1979, members of New York\'s gay community protested against the production of the film. Gay people were urged to disrupt filming and gay-owned businesses to bar the filmmakers from their premises. People attempted to interfere with shooting by pointing mirrors from rooftops to ruin lighting for scenes, blasting whistles and air horns near locations, and playing loud music. One thousand protesters marched through the East Village demanding the city withdraw support for the film. Al Pacino said that he understood the protests but insisted that upon reading the screenplay he never at any point felt that the film was anti-gay. He said that the leather bars were ""just a fragment of the gay community, the same way the Mafia is a fragment of Italian-American life"", referring to The Godfather (1972), and that he would ""never want to do anything to harm the gay community"".', u'The title is a play on words with a dual meaning, as ""cruising"" can describe police officers on patrol and also cruising for sex.', u""James A.

Rechy had written an essay defending Friedkin\'s right to make the film, although not defending the film itself. At Rechy\'s suggestion, Friedkin deleted a scene showing the Gay Liberation slogan ""We Are Everywhere"" as graffiti on a wall just before the first body part is pulled from the river, and added a disclaimer: ""This film is not intended as an indictment of the homosexual world. It is set in one small segment of that world, which is not meant to be representative of the whole."" Friedkin later claimed that it was the MPAA and United Artists that required the disclaimer, calling it ""part of the dark bargain that was made to get the film released at all"" and ""a sop to organized gay rights groups"". Friedkin claimed that no one involved in making the film thought it would be considered as representative of the entire gay community, but gay film historian Vito Russo disputes that, citing the disclaimer as ""an admission of guilt. What director would make such a statement if he truly believed that his film would not be taken to be representative of the whole?""', u'Timothy Bottoms was considered for the role of Steve Burns.']","[u'USA::8 February 1980 (New York City, New York)\n (premiere)', u'USA::15 February 1980', u'Australia::12 June 1980', u'Sweden::28 July 1980', u'Spain::14 August 1980 (Barcelona)', u'Netherlands::21 August 1980', u'West Germany::25 August 1980', u'France::23 September 1980', u'Italy::28 October 1980', u'Norway::28 October 1980', u'Japan::10 January 1981', u'Denmark::16 January 1981', u'Portugal::12 February 1981', u'Hong Kong::27 February 1981', u'Brazil::18 May 1981', u'Uruguay::29 May 1981', u'Mexico::24 September 1981', u'Argentina::7 January 1982', u'Italy::20 July 1982 (Mystfest)', u'Turkey::July 1989', u'USA::12 May 1995 (re-release)', u'Italy::December 1997 (Noir in Festival)', u'Italy::November 2003 (Turin Film Festival)', u'France::23 May 2007 (Cannes Film Festival)', u'Greece::September 2007 (Athens Film Festival)', u'Spain::9 October 2007 (Sitges Film Festival)', u'Greece::9 October 2007 (DVD premiere)', u'Germany::27 June 2015 (Munich International Film Festival)']",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

For this scene, Sidney Lumet told Charles Durning to improvise, and to immediately get Sonny on the defensive.

Standard procedure would be to shoot the street scenes on location, and then film the bank and barbershop interiors on sets constructed at a studio (where it's much easier to control lighting, sound, etc.). But Sidney Lumet wanted realistic continuity. He wanted us to see, for example, that when a character enters the bank from the street, he's really doing that-not walking through a door and emerging on a fake set miles away. Lumet got his wish and found a block of a Brooklyn street that suited his purposes, including a vacant warehouse that could be turned into a bank."", u'The bank where the robbery took place was a branch of the Chase Manhattan Bank, at 450 Avenue P on the corner of East 3rd Street, in Gravesend, Brooklyn.

Consequently, his character was replaced by Frankie Pentangeli (Michael V. Gazzo), who received an Oscar nomination for the performance.

Sonny curses at the ""Japs"" for dropping bombs in Hawaii on his father\'s birthday.', u'Timothy Carey, who had turned down the offer to play Luca Brasi in the original, was offered the role of Don Fanucci in this film. While performing his audition at Paramount Studios in which Francis Ford Coppola and Martin Scorsese were present, Carey pulled a prop gun loaded with blanks out of a pastry box he had with him, and fired a shot at Coppola, before pretending to commit suicide.

Producer Martin Bregman said he had to hurt Serpico's feelings and ordered him to leave because he believed that his presence would prove a distraction."", u""According to Sidney Lumet, Al Pacino always needed to be in the character's state of mind in any given scene and could not shed that state off camera, so he behaved accordingly at all times, either happy, joking, and laughing for a lighthearted scene or angry and lashing out at everyone if the scene they were working on called for that behavior."", u'Sidney Lumet was pleased with the cooperation of the NYPD, especially in light of the subject matter and the proximity in time to the actual events depicted in the movie.

They decided to use mostly unknown actors. Lumet said the best way to strengthen the sense of reality was not to use actors for whom audiences had a lot of previous associations. Even Al Pacino, despite his high exposure in The Godfather (1972), was still relatively new.', u""The actors were allowed to do some improvisation in their scenes. Much of Al Pacino's explosive reaction in Serpico's last abortive meeting with his former captain was off the cuff."", u'Sidney Lumet liked to do very simple things on the first day of shooting, like basic entrances and exits, to let actors and crew get used to each other and make them aware that things will move very quickly. He will often shoot just a single take and move quickly to another set-up. He said this process also helps to spot weak links in his team. The first day on this film, he worked at three different, fairly far-flung locations. Al Pacino was initially stunned, especially after coming off the methodically low, deliberate process of The Godfather (1972). But he and the rest of the cast soon learned that this fast pace had the benefit of keeping the inner tension of the narrative and the characters alive.', u'The aria, Serpico is listening in his garden is ""E lucevan le stelle"" (""And the stars were shining"") from Giacomo Puccini\'s opera Tosca. An opera that also deals with - among other things - corruption and abuse of power.', u'Speaking of the production in a later interview, Sidney Lumet said, ""Serpico, just physically and in terms of logistics, gives you the problem of keeping your emotional theme work in perspective. You have to ask yourself not only \'Where am I physically?\' but \'Where am I emotionally?\' I think I was more tired after finishing Serpico than almost any movie I\'ve ever done. There was also the obligation to the real Frank Serpico--to be honest with his life and not exploit it.""', u'Playwright Sidney Kingsley loaned his apartment to Sidney Lumet for use to film the party scene.

Francis Ford Coppola told Variety, ""There were many people killed in that movie, but everyone worries about the horse. It was the same on the set. When the head arrived, it upset many crew members who are animal lovers, who like little doggies. What they don\'t know is that we got the head from a pet food manufacturer who slaughters two hundred horses a day just to feed those little doggies.""', u'During an early shot of the scene where Vito Corleone returns home and his people carry him up the stairs, Marlon Brando put weights under his body on the bed as a prank, to make it harder to lift him.', u'Marlon Brando wanted to make Don Corleone ""look like a bulldog,"" so he stuffed his cheeks with cotton wool for the audition.

The extra\'s frightened reaction is genuine. Caan also came up with the idea of throwing money at the man to make up for breaking his camera. As he put it, ""Where I came from, you broke something, you replaced it or repaid the owner.""', u'There was intense friction between Francis Ford Coppola and Paramount, in which [Paramount] frequently tried to have Coppola replaced, citing his inability to stay on schedule, unnecessary expenses, and production and casting errors (Coppola actually completed the film ahead of schedule and budget).', u'The scenes in which Enzo comes to visit Vito Corleone in the hospital were shot in reverse, with the outside scene shot first. Gabriele Torrei, the actor who plays Enzo, had never acted in front of a camera before and his nervous shaking, after the car drives away, was real.', u'Whenever oranges appear in the film, they foreshadow death or a near death involving the Corleone family.', u'Note the attention to detail: most of the cars have wooden bumpers. Bumpers were removed by car owners during the war and replaced with wooden ones. The chrome ones were turned in to help with the war effort. After the war, it took years for them to be replaced.', u""The cat held by Marlon Brando in the opening scene was a stray that Coppola found while on the lot at Paramount, and was not originally called for in the script. So content was the cat that its purring muffled some of Brando's dialogue, and, as a result, most of his lines had to be looped."", u'According to Francis Ford Coppola, the film took 62 days to shoot.', u'The smack that Vito gives Johnny Fontane was not in the script. Marlon Brando improvised the smack and Al Martino\'s confused reaction was real.

Marlon Brando had seen him on TV during the Estes Kefauver hearings in 1951 and imitated his husky whisper in the film."", u'The line ""I\'m gonna make him an offer he can\'t refuse"" was selected by the American Film Institute on its list as one of the top 100 movie quotes. It was at #2, right behind ""Frankly, my dear, I don\'t give a damn"" from Gone with the Wind (1939).', u'According to Richard S. Castellano, he defended Gordon Willis during a disagreement Willis was having with Francis Ford Coppola. Coppola got revenge on Castellano by making him do twenty takes of the shots of Clemenza walking up four flight of stairs.', u'Although there are many claims of real Mafiosi as cast members, Francis Ford Coppola stated in a May 2009 interview with Howard Stern that no organized crime members were cast or used as consultants. Coppola went on to explain there are expectations of reciprocity once one is provided a ""favor"" by an organized crime member or otherwise involved in a business action with the same. He specifically denied the connection of Gianni Russo to organized crime. The closest Coppola claims to have come to a real gangster during production, at least to his knowledge, was an interaction with Lenny Montana, who played Luca Brasi. Coppola said, when he asked if Montana knew how to spin the cylinder of the revolver, Montana replied, ""You kiddin\'?""', u""Orson Welles lobbied to get the part of Don Vito Corleone, even offering to lose a good deal of weight in order to get the role. Francis Ford Coppola, a Welles fan, had to turn him down because he already had Marlon Brando in mind for the role and felt Welles wouldn't be right for it."", u""According to Mario Puzo, the character of Johnny Fontane was NOT based on Frank Sinatra. However, it was widely assumed that it was, and Sinatra was furious; when he met Puzo at a restaurant, he screamed vulgar terms and threats at Puzo. Sinatra was also vehemently opposed to the film. Due to this backlash, Fontane's role in the film was scaled down to a couple of scenes."", u'For the scene where Clemenza is cooking, Francis Ford Coppola originally wrote in the script, ""Clemenza browns some sausage."" Upon seeing this, Mario Puzo crossed out ""browns"" and replaced it with ""fries,"" writing in the margin, ""Gangsters don\'t brown.""', u""Al Pacino's maternal grandparents emigrated to America from Corleone, Sicily, just as Vito Corleone had."", u'At the meeting in the restaurant, Sollozzo speaks to Michael in Sicilian so rapidly that subtitles could not be used. He begins with, ""I am sorry. What happened to your father was business. I have much respect for your father. But your father, his thinking is old-fashioned. You must understand why I had to do that. Now let\'s work through where we go from here."" When Michael returns from the bathroom, he continues in Sicilian with, ""Everything all right? I respect myself, understand, and cannot allow another man to hold me back. What happened was unavoidable. I had the unspoken support of the other Family dons. If your father were in better health, without his eldest son running things, no disrespect intended, we wouldn\'t have this nonsense. We will stop fighting until your father is well and can resume bargaining. No vengeance will be taken. We will have peace. But your Family should interfere no longer.""', u'The character Moe Greene was modeled after Jewish mobster Bugsy Siegel, although Siegel was not known for wearing glasses. Both were assassinated with a shot through the eye, with the glasses worn by Greene being necessary in order to accomplish the special effect eye shot.', u'Director Francis Ford Coppola worked with relatives in this film, (making it a family film in many contexts). In chronological order of appearance: his sister, Talia Shire, portrayed Connie Corleone throughout the trilogy, his mother, Italia Coppola, serves as an extra in the restaurant meeting, his father, Carmine Coppola, is the piano player in the Mattress sequence and, he composed the music, his sons Gian-Carlo Coppola and Roman Coppola, can be seen as extras in the scene where Sonny beats up Carlo, and he is at the funeral, and his daughter, Sofia Coppola, is the baby, Michael Rizzi, in the baptism (she was three weeks old at the time of shooting).', u""Francis Ford Coppola was reluctant to let his sister, Talia Shire, audition for the role of Connie. He felt she was too pretty for the part and did not want to be accused of nepotism. Only at Mario Puzo's request did Shire get a chance to audition."", u'Because Corleone, Sicily, was too developed, even in the early 1970s, the Sicilian town of Savoca, outside Taormina, was used for shooting the scenes where Michael is in exile in Italy.', u""One of the reasons why Francis Ford Coppola finally agreed to direct the film was because he was in debt to Warner Brothers, following $400,000 budget overruns on George Lucas's THX 1138 (1971). Lucas urged him to take the job."", u'George Lucas put together the ""Mattress Sequence"" (the montage of crime scene photos and headlines about the war between the five families) as a favor to Francis Ford Coppola for helping him fund American Graffiti (1973). He asked not to be credited. Lucas used photos from real crime scenes. The one pictured is Frank ""The Enforcer"" Nitti, Al Capone\'s right-hand man who had not been murdered, but actually shot himself. During the scene Coppola\'s father Carmine Coppola is the piano player.', u'Francis Ford Coppola insisted on the film being called ""Mario Puzo\'s The Godfather"" rather than just ""The Godfather,"" because his original draft of the screenplay was so faithful to Puzo\'s novel, he thought Puzo deserved the credit for it.', u""In 1974, the film premiered on NBC over two nights: Saturday, November 16th, and Monday, November 18th, from 9-11 PM. Both nights, at 11 PM, New York City's Municipal Water Authorities had some overflow problems from all the toilets flushing around the same time."", u'Gianni Russo used his organized crime connections to secure the role of Carlo Rizzi, going so far as to get a camera crew to film his own audition and send it to the producers. However, Marlon Brando was initially against having Russo, who had never acted before, in the film; this made Russo furious and he went to threaten Brando. However, this reckless act proved to be a blessing in disguise, because Brando thought Russo was acting and was convinced he would be good for the role.', u'Al Pacino wore a foam latex facial appliance that covered his entire left cheek and was made up with colors to match his skin tone and give the effect of bruising, to simulate the effect of having his jaw broken by Captain McCluskey.', u""Francis Ford Coppola turned in an initial director's cut running 126 minutes. Paramount production chief Robert Evans rejected this version and demanded a longer cut with more scenes about the family. The final release version was nearly 50 minutes longer than Coppola's initial cut."", u""The three-year-old child actor, Anthony Gounaris, responded best when his real name was used while shooting the film. That is why Michael's son's name is Anthony."", u'Richard S. Castellano ad-libbed the line ""Leave the gun, Take the cannoli.""', u'The very first scene to be shot was the one where Michael and Kay go Christmas shopping.', u'Sergio Leone was approached to direct the film, but turned it down since he felt the story, which glorified the Mafia, was not interesting enough. He later regretted refusing the offer, but would go on to direct his own critically acclaimed gangster film, Once Upon a Time in America (1984).', u'A young Sylvester Stallone auditioned for the roles of Paulie Gatto and Carlo Rizzi, but was not cast for either. Stallone instead decided to try his hand at writing, first completing the screenplay for the modestly successful The Lords of Flatbush (1974). He would later get his break in Rocky (1976), alongside Talia Shire, who portrays Connie Corleone in this film.', u'Stanley Kubrick thought the film had the best cast ever and could be the best movie ever made.', u""In many of the Sicily scenes, Michael wipes his nose with a handkerchief. The novel explains that McCluskey's punch did damage to his sinuses."", u'During pre-production, Francis Ford Coppola shot his own unofficial screen tests with Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, and Diane Keaton at his home in San Francisco. Robert Evans was unimpressed by them and insisted that official screen tests be held. The studio spent $420,000 on the screen tests but in the end, the actors Coppola originally wanted were hired.', u'The scenes of Michael and Kay at the wedding at the beginning were actually shot at night. Due to the rushed schedule, Francis Ford Coppola had to get their scenes in the bag. Cinematographer Gordon Willis was furious at having to rig up so many lights.', u""When Vito Corleone has his brush with death, there is a poster of Jake LaMotta hanging on a building wall behind the fruit vendor.

According to Robert Evans in his autobiography, Colombo called his home and threatened him and his family. Paramount received many letters during pre-production from Italian-Americans, including politicians, decrying the film as anti-Italian. They threatened to protest and disrupt filming. Producer Albert S. Ruddy met with Colombo, who demanded that the terms ""Mafia"" and ""Cosa Nostra"" not be used in the film. Ruddy gave them the right to review the script and make changes. He also agreed to hire League members (read: mobsters) as extras and advisers. The angry letters ceased after this agreement was made.

Oscar winner Rod Steiger campaigned hard for the role of Michael, even though he was too old for the part. Warren Beatty, Jack Nicholson, and Dustin Hoffman were all offered the part of Michael Corleone, but all refused. (Beatty was also offered directing and producing duties.) Suggestions of Alain Delon and Burt Reynolds were rejected by Francis Ford Coppola. Paramount production chief Robert Evans wanted Robert Redford to be cast in the part, but Coppola demurred, as he was too WASP-y. Evans explained that Redford could fit the role as he could be perceived as ""northern Italian."" Evans eventually lost the struggle over the actor he derided as ""The Midget."" The Irish-American Ryan O\'Neal then became the front-runner for the part, though it eventually devolved onto James Caan. Before being cast as Michael, Al Pacino was committed to starring in The Gang That Couldn\'t Shoot Straight (1971). Coppola, in a 2003 ""Cigar Aficionado"" interview, said that Paramount pulled some strings and managed to get Pacino released. The Paramount brass, particularly Evans, were adamantly opposed to casting Pacino, who did poorly in screen tests, until they saw his excellent performance in The Panic in Needle Park (1971). Caan went back to his original role of Sonny when Pacino came on board. Robert De Niro tested for both Michael and Sonny and was almost cast as Carlo, before being cast as Paulie.

Evans insisted on Caan because he wanted at least one ""name"" actor to play one of the brothers and because the 6\'4"" Caridi would tower over Pacino on screen.

There is a rumor that Burt Reynolds was originally cast as Sonny Corleone, but Marlon Brando wouldn\'t act with him, considering him more a TV star.', u'When writing the novel, Mario Puzo either directly or indirectly borrowed ideas from real life Mafia stories. Specifically, he borrowed a lot of from the life of New York gangster ""Crazy"" Joe Gallo, including the dynamics of he and his brothers. In the movie, Sonny is the ""hot head"" (Like Crazy Joe), Michael is the thoughtful and intelligent one (Like Larry Gallo), and Fredo is the dimwit (Like Michael Gallo). Also terms like ""Sleeping with the fishes"" and ""Hitting the mattresses"" came from the lives of the Gallos. An associate of the Gallos was killed while on a fishing trip with friends and the Gallos were sent a fish wrapped in a box just as when Sonny gets Luca Brasi\'s bulletproof vest with a fish.

When asked for his opinion by the Paramount brass, Coppola said he wanted to cast either Laurence Olivier or Marlon Brando as the Don.

Coppola, however, was adamant in his conviction that Brando take the role instead. This would be the third time Brando performed in a part sought by Sinatra, after playing Terry Malloy in On the Waterfront (1954) and Sky Masterson in Guys and Dolls (1955). Brando\'s previous film, Burn! (1969), had been a terrible flop and he could not get work in American pictures, being considered by many producers as ""washed up."" Paramount executives initially would offer Marlon Brando only union scale for the role of Don Corleone. Finally, the studio relented and paid Brando $300,000, according to Coppola\'s account. In his autobiography The Kid Stays in the Picture (2002), former Paramount production chief Robert Evans claims that Brando was paid $50,000, plus points, and sold back his points to Paramount before the release of the picture for an additional $100,000 because he had female-related money troubles.

At the time Paramount execs only saw the early scenes of Michael at the wedding and were exclaiming, ""When is he going to do something?"" When they finally saw the scene where Michael shoots Sollozzo and McCluskey in the restaurant, they changed their minds and Pacino got to keep his job.', u""Francis Ford Coppola shot Sonny's assassination scene in one take with different cameras positioned at each shot. This was because there were 149 squibs taped onto James Caan's body to simulate the effect of rapid machine-gun fire, and they couldn't shoot another take."", u'Body count: 18 (including the horse).', u'Fabrizio, Michael\'s Sicilian bodyguard who planted the bomb that killed Appolonia, was supposed to be found by Michael at a pizza parlor he opens in America and subsequently blown away with a shotgun at the end of the movie as per ""The Godfather"" novel. This scene was filmed but ultimately cut because the makeup artists plastered Angelo Infanti with so much fake blood that the scene looked ridiculous. Photos of Michael Corleone with a hat, shotgun blazing, appeared in many magazines, despite the scene\'s eventual excision. Fabrizio\'s death was filmed again, for The Godfather: Part II (1974), this time by car bomb (as the ultimate form of poetic justice), but that scene was also deleted from the theatrical version. It was restored in The Godfather Saga (1977).', u""Moe Green's execution by a bullet through his eye was accomplished by a hidden pellet shooter in the glasses' frame that smashed the lens outward."", u""Sonny Corleone's death scene at a highway toll booth was to take place on the Jones Beach Causeway, but was actually filmed on a small airport runway at Mitchell Field on Long Island. The scene was the most expensive in the movie to set up and film for it cost over $100,000 to set up and was finished in just one take from four or five different camera angles. The large billboard next to the toll booth was set up to hide the appearance of a modern high-rise building in the background. According to Joe Gelmis, 110 brass casings containing gunpowder squibs and sacks of blood were deployed all over James Caan's body. Plus there were over 200 pre-drilled holes in his car, a 1941 Lincoln, filled with squibs to simulate the ambush attack."", u'The presence of oranges in the Godfather trilogy indicates that a death-related event will soon occur (even though production designer Dean Tavoularis claimed the oranges were simply used to brighten up the darkly shot film). In chronological order of such events: Hagen and Woltz negotiate Johnny Fontane\'s position at a table with a bowl of oranges on it, and later Woltz discovers his horse\'s severed headDon Corleone buys oranges right before he is shot. He does not die, but his missing driver/bodyguard, Paulie, does die;Sonny drives past an advertisement for Florida Oranges before he is assassinated;At the Mafioso summit, bowls of oranges are placed on the table (specifically in front of those Dons who will be assassinated);Michael eats an orange while discussing his plans with Hagen for assassinating the other dons;Before Don Corleone dies, he puts an orange peel in his mouth to playfully scare his grandson;Tessio, who is executed for attempting to betray Michael, plays with an orange at Connie\'s wedding. In fact, he reaches across the table to grab it, indicating that he will ""cross"" the Corleones;And in a slight twist, there are no real oranges for Carlo Rizzi, but Rizzi does wear an orange suit right before Sonny beats him up, then helps to arrange Sonny\'s death, and is himself garroted in retribution for Sonny\'s death later.- The only deaths in the film that don\'t appear to have oranges foreshadowing them are the assassinations of Sollozzo, McCluskey and Apollonia. It appears as if oranges do not presage Paulie\'s death, but they do, when he is \'out sick\' as the driver/bodyguard for Don Corleone, and the don decides to buy oranges before the attempted, but unsuccessful, assassination, thereby causing Santino to order Paulie\'s death. In Paulie\'s first scene, he gives Clemenza a pitcher of wine with oranges floating in it. Clemenza, who tells him to ""do his job,"" also takes him on the drive where he is killed for not doing his job faithfully.', u'Robert De Niro was originally cast as the ill-fated driver Paulie, while Al Pacino had accepted a role in Bang the Drum Slowly (1973). Francis Ford Coppola wanted Pacino so badly for the role of Michael that he persuaded the producers of the other film to release him from his contract. This meant he had to provide a replacement, so De Niro was released from his contract on this film.', u""The relationship between Francis Ford Coppola and Gordon Willis was highly combustible. They would often have screaming rows, with a few broken props as a result. After one incident, such a loud noise exploded from Coppola's office that the crew thought that Coppola had shot himself (he had only broken a door). They also conflicted because Willis was very hard on the actors about hitting their marks - with his low lighting scheme, if they missed, they would be filmed in total darkness. Coppola, on the other hand, considered himself a protector of actors. He felt that he could get the most out of them by nurturing them."", u'Don Vito Corleone died on July 29, 1955.', u'At Connie\'s wedding, Sonny is seen in close quarters with Lucy Mancini (Jeannie Linero) Connie\'s maid of honour at the event (wearing a pink dress). According to the novel, Sonny takes Lucy as his mistress (she is ""that young girl"" Don Corleone mentions to Sonny; she is also seen before Sonny visits Connie). The novel and film trilogy differ on her fate, though: in the film she eventually moves on, settling down with a Las Vegas doctor; she is briefly seen in The Godfather: Part III (1990), with her son Vincent playing a major role.', u""Sonny's death scene was inspired by the ending of Bonnie and Clyde (1967)."", u'Virgil ""The Turk"" Sollozzo and Captain Marc McCluskey were murdered in January 1946.', u'Nearly all deaths are foreshadowed by seen oranges. Even Fredo\'s death in ""The Godfahter II."" is already foreshadowed in ""The Godfahter I."" In the scene were Fredo is alone with Vito Corleone in his room, after his return from the hospital, there is a small tree full of oranges placed on the table right beside Fredo.', u'Michael Corleone continually drinks water in the first two films, hinting that he is diabetic. He later suffers a diabetic coma on the third film.', u'After Michael attempts the assassination, they originally planned an intermission, but director Francis Ford Coppola thought that it would just slow down the pace of the movie.', u'In 2008 this film has been included in the list of Hollywood non-Reproduction Movies of all times among greatest 100 script in history', u""After Clemenza and Tessio are turned down by Michael, Clemenza shakes right hands with the Godfather but Tessio uses his left hand to shake Michael's right hand.""]","[u'USA::14 March 1972 (New York City, New York)\n (premiere)', u'USA::15 March 1972 (New York City, New York)', u'USA::22 March 1972 (Los Angeles, California)', u'Canada::24 March 1972', u'USA::24 March 1972', u'Brazil::7 July 1972', u'Japan::15 July 1972', u'Uruguay::10 August 1972', u'UK::23 August 1972 (London)\n (premiere)', u'UK::24 August 1972', u'West Germany::24 August 1972', u'Ireland::25 August 1972', u'Italy::14 September 1972 (Rome)\n (premiere)', u'Argentina::20 September 1972', u'Italy::21 September 1972', u'Sweden::27 September 1972', u'Finland::29 September 1972', u'Greece::29 September 1972', u'France::30 September 1972 (Paris)\n (premiere)', u'Mexico::4 October 1972', u'Norway::16 October 1972 (Oslo)', u'France::18 October 1972', u'Spain::20 October 1972', u'Portugal::24 October 1972', u'Belgium::27 October 1972 (Gent)', u'Australia::2 November 1972', u'Denmark::26 December 1972', u'Poland::31 December 1972', u'Netherlands::18 January 1973', u'Japan::24 March 1973 (re-release)', u'Turkey::October 1973', u'Hong Kong::11 October 1973', u'Czechoslovakia::1 January 1975', u'South Korea::25 May 1977', u'Japan::7 October 1978 (re-release)', u'Italy::18 August 1979 (re-release)', u'Hong Kong::24 January 1980 (re-release)', u'Taiwan::31 October 1980 (re-release)', u'Hungary::25 March 1982', u'Australia::1 November 1990 (re-release)', u'Turkey::30 November 1990 (re-release)', u'Iceland::6 March 1991 (re-release)', u'USA::21 March 1997 (re-release)', u'Australia::7 August 1997 (re-release)', u'Mexico::14 August 1998 (re-release)', u'Canada::23 September 2001 (Cinefest Sudbury International Film Festival)', u'Germany::February 2004 (Berlin International Film Festival)', u'Japan::19 June 2004 (re-release)', u'France::September 2004 (Deauville Film Festival)', u'France::2 August 2006 (re-release)', u'Italy::15 June 2008 (Taormina International Film Festival)', u'Brazil::27 September 2008 (Festival do Rio BR)', u'Italy::23 October 2008 (Rome Film Festival)', u'UK::25 September 2009 (re-release)', u'Canada::5 February 2010 (Digital Film Festival)', u'South Korea::27 May 2010 (re-release)', u'Italy::2 November 2010 (re-release)', u'Spain::17 June 2011 (re-release)', u'Netherlands::10 November 2011 (re-release)', u'Argentina::24 November 2011 (re-release)', u'USA::1 March 2012 (re-release) (limited)', u'Taiwan::19 October 2012 (re-release)', u'Peru::29 November 2012 (re-release)', u'Mexico::8 February 2013 (re-release)', u'France::18 September 2013 (re-release)', u'Chile::24 January 2015 (re-release)', u'China::18 April 2015 (Beijing International Film Festival)', u'Israel::17 July 2015 (Jerusalem Film Festival)', u'Peru::4 June 2016 (re-release) (limited)', u'Greece::30 June 2016 (re-release)', u'Australia::16 September 2016 (Brisbane) (Sydney) (re-release)', u'Sweden::10 November 2016 (Stockholm International Film Festival)']",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
