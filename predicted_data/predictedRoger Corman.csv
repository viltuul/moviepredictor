Just before the ten year option ran out, and in order to meet the terms of the contract so they would have first refusal to renew them, Constantin films hurriedly had put this film into production. Marvel were not impressed at the low budget results and in order to avoid damaging the brand they quietly bought the few film prints and negative from Constantin films to avoid the possibility of it getting any kind of theatrical or video release. (but not before somebody in the industry had managed to make an illicit video copy). Both Roger Corman (who produced the film), the director Oley Sassone and the cast and crew of the film were not consulted or informed of this move, as there were indeed plans in place for a small theatrical release and a trailer had been made with this in mind. It is rumored that Marvel subsequently had all the film prints and the negative destroyed.The end result was that Constantin films were able to keep another ten year option on the Fantastic Four film series. After Cnstantin Films secured funding from 20th Century Fox the big budget 2005 version was the end result, After the box office success of the 2005 version, and several years before Marvel had formed their own film studios, Marvel then renewed Constantin Films ten year option and this resulted in the 2007 sequel and the 2015 reboot. However the critical and financial failure of the 2015 version made Fox get cold feet in the FF project and withdrew t concentrate on keeping hold of it's more successful and profitable Marvel Franchise, 'The X-Men'.

As the film was meant to compete with Jurassic Park (1993), Brosnan later wrote that he was taken aback when it was revealed that the film\'s budget would have only been $1 million. Although concerned that the restrictive budget would require a reduction in the amount of dinosaurs used, Corman assured him that he was free to write whatever he wanted, and that any modifications would be made in the final draft. Once Brosnan sent his first draft to Hollywood, he lost all contact with the film crew. His screenplay had in fact been heavily revised to the point where his credit had been reduced to ""original story"".', u'The movie bares little resemblance to the original 1984 novel by Harry Adam Knight, the pseudonym for Australian author John Brosnan.

The footage of the airbag in use was sent to the U.S. Congress so they could pass a law (the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991) dictating that airbags should be installed in all automobiles manufactured after September 1, 1998.

He also had braces on both legs, and had difficulty standing or walking without his cane; the weakness of his legs is visible in some scenes. Fortunately, Karloff lived long enough to view the completed film as well as enjoy the accolades he deserved for his performance.', u'Roger Corman told Peter Bogdanovich he could make any film he wanted to, with two conditions: he had to use stock footage from The Terror (1963), and he had to hire Boris Karloff for two days (Karloff was under contract and owed Corman those two days). Karloff was so impressed with the script that he refused pay for any shooting time over his contracted two days. He worked for a total of five days on the movie.', u'The sequence with Bobby Thompson shooting people in cars driving on a freeway from the top of an oil storage tank was loosely inspired by the Highway 101 sniper attack where on April 25, 1965, a 16-year-old alienated youth, named Michael Andrew Clark, shot at motorists from a hilltop along Highway 101 just south of Orcutt, California, killing three and injuring 10 others before committing suicide. Prior to the shooting spree, Clark left behind a note vowing to make his parents ""die a thousand times in court"" for his actions, and he was right; a lawsuit was brought against Clark\'s parents by two of the victim\'s families for mistreating and not raising their son well, and negligence for allowing Clark access to the hunting rifle used for the shooting spree.', u'The story Orlok tells of the servant fleeing death is W. Somerset Maugham\'s short story ""The Appointment in Samarra."" Reportedly, Karloff nailed the telling of the story in a single take, and received a standing ovation from everyone on set.', u'Peter Bogdanovich planned to have Boris Karloff actually appear in the film for about 20 minutes with two days of filming, and have the stock footage from The Terror (1963) add another 20 minutes of screen time for Karloff. In the final movie, Karloff is actually on screen (not counting the scenes from ""The Terror"") for about 30 minutes and shot all his scenes in five days.', u'Aside from background music played on a car radio, there is no musical soundtrack for the movie.', u'The shooter can be heard taking a breath and holding it before each shot when he fires. This is the correct way for a sniper to steady his weapon before pulling the trigger. But when he fires shots at the moving vehicles on the freeway, the crosshairs are centered on the driver or the passenger - which would cause the shooter to miss, because he\'s not ""leading"" his rapidly moving targets. However, director Peter Bogdanovich did this because audiences would not understand why the shooter was aiming well ahead of each vehicle before he fired. They would expect all his shots to miss if the shooter had done this.', u""The house in which Tim O'Kelly's clean-cut character lives with his happy family is given a fantasy look by the cartoonish colors of the walls in each room, and the strange lack of doorknobs on many interior doors. The sparse wall decorations and the smallness of the rooms gives the house a claustrophobic look. Director Peter Bogdanovich did all this to reflect the warped fairy-tale nature of the deranged young shooter's life."", u""Voices of Joey Bishop and announcer Regis Philbin can be heard in background, excerpted from Bishop's late night ABC TV talk show of late Sixties."", u""The sets for Bobby Thompson's home and for Orlok's hotel room are the same set pieces, with some redressing and a new paint job."", u'As the film includes extracts from Roger Corman\'s film ""The Terror"", Corman suggested to Peter Bogdanovich that the little-known actor who appears opposite Boris Karloff in that film should also appear in this one, perhaps in the role of the killer. Bogdanovich turned down this idea. The young actor became world-famous shortly after ""Targets"" first appeared - it was Jack Nicholson.', u""Frank Marshall's parents and then-girlfriend appear as film-goers at the drive-in scenes. The film's dolly grip also appears, as the father shot, to the horror of his son who is sitting next to him in one of the cars."", u'Drive-in scenes were shot at the since-closed Reseda Drive-In Theatre in Reseda, CA, as clearly shown on the marquee and screen tower. Early in the movie, the Sepulveda Drive-In in Van Nuys is briefly shown in the background as Bobby drives down the highway. On the DVD commentary, Peter Bogdanovich incorrectly credits this as being the Reseda Drive-In.', u'Peter Bogdanovich named his own character ""Sammy Michaels"" after Samuel Fuller (whose middle name is ""Michael"") in gratitude for the work Fuller did on the script.', u'Shot in 22 days and completed in December 1967 (copyright 1967). Due to its controversial nature, Paramount only released it after inserting a written prologue denouncing gun violence.', u""According to Peter Bogdanovich's introduction to the film on the DVD, the scene in which Sammy wakes up with a hangover and is jolted when the first thing he sees is Byron Orlok originally called for him to laugh at himself, but he couldn't manage it. Boris Karloff suggested the bit that is actually used in the film - and ad-libbed Orlok's start when he unexpectedly confronts himself in a mirror, as well."", u'The sniping scene at the oil tank was shot without a sound technician. All the noises were added in post.', u""When film cameras, which run at 24 frames per second, film directly off the screen of US televisions, which run at 30 fps, the result is a dark or light bar across the image, rolling from top to bottom. To avoid this effect in the scene when Sammy and Orlok are watching The Criminal Code (1931), in most shots a film picture was matted in over the TV screen, giving a steady picture with no bar. However, according to Peter Bogdanovich's DVD commentary, they couldn't afford to use a matte for the establishing shot for the scene, which pans across the TV's screen, so the bar appears in that shot and only that shot (in Europe, where the TV frame rate is 25 fps, often they simply run the film camera at 25 fps also, for shots with a TV picture in them)."", u'Although the character of Byron Orlock is based on the man who plays him (Boris Karloff), the similarities are very few. Both are respected and iconic British actors known for their roles in horror films, but while Orlock is embittered with the film industry and wants to retire, Karloff never retired and was always grateful for his success in the film industry. Also, while Orlock seems regretful of his status as a ""horror actor,"" Karloff was in fact very proud of his legacy, and was particularly proud of his most famous role, Frankenstein\'s monster.', u'When Bobby writes out the check to buy the sniper rifle, he writes the check out to Boris Karloff.', u""When Roger Corman hired Bogdanovich to direct, Corman asked if Bogdanovich was familiar with the directorial styles of Alfred Hitchcock and Howard Hawks with Hitchcock's work being very concise, efficient and organized while Hawks opted for a more kinetic shooting style that was partly improvised without much organization. Corman advised Bogdanovich to shoot like Hitchcock."", u'In the beginning credits of the movie, it states, ""Radio music supplied by Charles Greene and Brian Stone"". The music that they used was ""Green Rocky Road"", performed by the band ""The Daily Flash"", which Greene and Stone managed.', u""Samuel Fuller advised Peter Bogdanovich to save as much money as possible, in order to have the film's climax be as epic as it could be."", u'Was edited into a GP rated version and re-released in 1971 in order to capitalize on the popularity of The Last Picture Show (1971)', u'Included among the ""1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die"", edited by Steven Schneider.', u'(at around 50 mins) The horror story which Orlok (Boris Karloff) tells directly to the audience in his distinctive voice - about a man in ancient times who flees to another city because he believes Death is planning to take him at a certain time and place - is similar to the wonderful stories by mystery writer Michael Avallone for a 1950s radio program called ""The Frightened"". Karloff\'s powerful delivery of the stories were accompanied by chilling background music and sound effects (including screams, gasps, and terrified pleas for help). In the early 1960s, Mercury Records released thirteen of the stories on two albums entitled ""Tales of the Frightened"" (volume 1 and 2). They can be heard at Archive.org. Karloff also recorded an album called ""Tales of Mystery and Imagination"", which includes The Legend of Sleepy Hollow.']","[u'Italy::June 1968 (Pesaro Film Festival)', u'USA::13 August 1968 (New York City, New York)\n (premiere)', u'USA::15 August 1968', u'Sweden::15 October 1969', u'Denmark::13 March 1970', u'France::31 March 1971', u'West Germany::20 November 1972 (TV premiere)', u'Spain::29 May 1974 (re-release)', u'Greece::14 April 2004 (DVD premiere)']",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

As shown in the film, Aiello, knowing he was marked for death by Capone, did arrange to have a cousin purchase a train ticket for him at the last minute so that he could skip town. However, he was killed by machine gunners from an apartment window opposite his apartment building as he was leaving to catch the train on October 23rd, 1930: A year and nine months after the massacre, not before.']","[u'USA::30 June 1967', u'Japan::29 July 1967', u'Sweden::16 August 1967', u'West Germany::6 October 1967', u'Italy::25 October 1967', u'Finland::3 November 1967', u'France::16 November 1967', u'Mexico::21 December 1967', u'Spain::29 January 1968 (Madrid)', u'Denmark::5 February 1968', u'Hong Kong::23 May 1968', u'Turkey::19 January 1969', u'UK::26 June 2009 (Edinburgh International Film Festival)']",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

THE CHALLENGE OF EVERY OUTLAW GUNMAN! THE NOTORIOUS SELF-DEFENSE KILLER! (original print ad - all caps)', u""His only friend was his gun... His only refuge - a woman's heart!""]","[u""Based on the life and exploits of an actual western gunslinger named John Ringo, a distant cousin of the outlaw Younger family. The real Ringo was a ruthless murderer and survivor of the infamous gunfight at the OK Corral, against (Dr.) John Holliday, Wyatt Earp and the Earp brothers. Also unlike the movie's account, the actual John Ringo--his real name--suffered a severe bout of melancholy following a visit to his family in California in July of 1882 and went on a monumental ten-day alcoholic binge, which climaxed when he sat down under an oak tree, drew his gun and used it to commit suicide."", u'The original story was written by John Bowers and Andr\xe9 De Toth with John Wayne in mind. Wayne loved it and offered Bowers $10,000 for it. The writer thought it was worth more and told Wayne how he felt. The actor reportedly said, ""Well, you wrote it for me. Don\'t you have any artistic integrity?"" Bowers later got $70,000 for it at Fox, and Wayne harboured ill-feelings about the incident, accusing Bowers of selling it out from under him. In addition, Wayne refused to work for Columbia Pictures because its chief, Harry Cohn, had mistreated him years before when he was a young contract player. Cohn had bought the project for Wayne, but Wayne\'s grudge was too deep, and Cohn sold the script to Twentieth Century Fox, which cast Gregory Peck in the role Wayne badly wanted but for which he refused to bend. When the Reno Chamber of Commerce named Peck the top western star for 1950 and presented him with the Silver Spurs award, an angry Wayne said, ""Well, who the hell decided that you were the best cowboy of the year?"". Wayne\'s final film, The Shootist (1976), is very similar to this film.', u'The large painting on the wall behind Gregory Peck\'s chair in the barroom is ""Custer\'s Last Fight"", painted in 1884 by Cassily Adams and reproduced as a lithographic print by Otto Becker from Adams\' original painting. These prints were distributed in 1896 to bars and taverns all over America by the Anheuser Busch Co.', u'The studio hated Gregory Peck\'s authentic period mustache. In fact, the head of production at Fox, Spyros P. Skouras, was out of town when production began. By the time he got back, so much of the film had been shot that it was too late to order Peck to shave it off and re-shoot. After the film did not do well at the box office, Skouras ran into Peck and he reportedly said, ""That mustache cost us millions"".', u'In the original ending Hunt Bromley was arrested by the sheriff, but studio chief Darryl F. Zanuck was so enraged at this resolution that director Henry King and writer Nunnally Johnson concocted the ending where Bromley is beaten up by the sheriff and let go. That satisfied Zanuck more.', u'The western street in this film is the same one used in The Ox-Bow Incident (1943).', u'""Screen Director\'s Playhouse"" broadcast a 60 minute radio adaptation of the movie on June 7, 1951 with Gregory Peck reprising his film role.', u'Bob Dylan\'s 1986 song ""Brownsville Girl,"" co-written with Sam Shepard, alludes to watching Gregory Peck in this film. Peck himself thanked Dylan publicly when he delivered the speech when Dylan was given his Kennedy Center award in 1997.', u'In 1996, veteran character actor Richard Jaeckel, who played ""Eddie"", was diagnosed with cancer at the same time his wife had Alzheimer\'s disease. The Jaeckels had lost their Brentwood (CA) home, were over $1 million in debt and Jaeckel was basically homeless. His family tried unsuccessfully to place him into the Motion Picture and Television Hospital in Woodland Hills, CA. Peck lobbied for Jaeckel\'s admittance, and three days later Jaeckel was placed in the facility. He stayed in the hospital until his death in June 1997.', u'Filmmaker John Singleton has cited this film as influencing him more than any other film.', u""Opening credits: In the Southwest of the 1880's the difference between death and glory was often but a fraction of a second. This was the speed that made champions of Wyatt Earp, Billy the Kid, and Wild Bill Hickok. But the fastest man with a gun who ever lived, by many contemporary accounts, was a long, lean Texan named Ringo."", u'The theme music used in the trailer for this film is actually the theme from Yellow Sky (1948), also starring Gregory Peck.', u'This marked the return of Jean Parker to films after a five-year absence.', u""Cinematographer Charles G. Clarke shot the title backgrounds using Gregory Peck's double."", u""The film's original title was The Big Gun."", u""The film was the second of Henry King's six collaborations with Gregory Peck."", u'Skip Homeier is the last surviving principal cast member.', u""While Ringo was talking to the Marshall in the saloon, he said that he was 35 and hadn't even got a watch. Gregory Peck was 34 at the time."", u'Roger Corman was a script reader at Fox, and advised that this should go straight into production. He also claims to have made contributions and adjustments to the screenplay, but has never been credited.', u'Clark Gable was offered the lead role.', u""Gregory Peck said about 'The Gunfighter' - 'Tis one of my favorite pictures of all the pictures I've made'."", u""Included among the American Film Institute's 1998 list of the 400 movies nominated for the Top 100 Greatest American Movies."", u'This film was the subject of the classic Bob Dylan song ""Brownsville Girl"". It starts: ""There was this movie I seen one time, about a man riding \'cross the desert and it starred Gregory Peck. He was shot down by a hungry kid, trying to make a name for himself, the townspeople wanted to track that kid down and string him up by his neck. \'Turn him loose, let him go, let him say he outdrew me fair and square. I want him to feel what it\'s like to every moment face his death\'"" Then Dylan goes on to compare his own position in pop music to the gunfighter.']","[u'USA::26 May 1950 (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania)', u'USA::9 June 1950 (San Francisco, California)', u'USA::23 June 1950 (New York City, New York)', u'Canada::30 June 1950 (Toronto)', u'UK::10 August 1950 (London)', u'Sweden::21 August 1950', u'Brazil::8 September 1950', u'Italy::8 September 1950', u'Finland::10 November 1950', u'Australia::15 December 1950', u'Belgium::19 January 1951 (Brussels)', u'Portugal::5 June 1951', u'Japan::13 November 1951', u'France::4 April 1952', u'Denmark::21 April 1952', u'Argentina::21 August 1952', u'West Germany::3 July 1953', u'Austria::October 1953', u'Denmark::16 November 1964 (re-release)', u'Austria::August 1965 (re-release)']",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Also, the reason Scooby-Doo and Shaggy make cameos in the film, even though they are not Looney Tunes, was because Joe Dante wanted some non-Warner Brothers characters in the film like Tom & Jerry, and Droopy, but Warner Brothers thought that would be too weird, so they told him a Scooby-Doo cameo would seem more ""appropriate"". If one looks closely, the animation of Scooby and Shaggy is stiffer, and more limited than that of the Looney Tunes characters, referring to the drastically cheaper budgets of the Hanna-Barbera studio, at the time the original Scooby series was created.', u""Joe Dante refuses to talk about this movie in interview in great detail. All he's said is that he only agreed to direct the film to pay tribute to Chuck Jones, who had recently passed away and was a close friend of Dante's and that Warner Brothers gave him no freedom in the creative process."", u'In the cartoon where Elmer Fudd shoots Bugs Bunny, when we see a clapperboard, the director is J.

Consequently, his character was replaced by Frankie Pentangeli (Michael V. Gazzo), who received an Oscar nomination for the performance.

As shown in the film, Aiello, knowing he was marked for death by Capone, did arrange to have a cousin purchase a train ticket for him at the last minute so that he could skip town.

Corman quickly wrote some new dialogue for Granger to satisfy his concerns (though he has declined to state how much of that dialogue made it into the finished film), and filming proceeded before the smoke dissipated."", u'Director Roger Corman once said of this film: ""The odd thing about this movie is that it had a very similar plot to an old western of mine, Five Guns West (1955). It also came out before The Dirty Dozen (1967). I\'ve heard stories that the producers of \'The Dirty Dozen\' actually postponed production of their film an entire year because they realized that our story-lines were so similar.""', u'Producer Roger Corman once described how this film came about: "". . . Bob Campbell [R. Wright Campbell], who had just done [The Young Racers (1963)] for me, had finished a script titled \'The Dubious Patriots\'. Once again, the theme was one I liked very much: bad men sent to do good as a way to redeem themselves and win their freedom. In New York--on the way back from Racers--I gave Picker [David V. Picker] the script on a Friday and he said, \'We\'ll look at it. But we\'re backed up with scripts and it might be a few weeks before I can get to it.\'"" Picker rang Corman on Monday and the picture was given the go-ahead. Corman was surprised because his experience with the major studios was not always positive. Corman added: ""It went that fast. Right place at the right time. The title was changed to ""The Secret Invasion"", which was believed to be more commercial. UA budgeted the production at $600,000, which was double my bigger Poe [Edgar Allan Poe] pictures. The film was shot in the summer of 1963.""', u'Director Roger Corman said of the changes to the original script, ""Initially, the prisoner being held was an atomic scientist, the only man knowing the missing key ingredient in the equations to make an atomic bomb. So by freeing him, the five criminals help unleash atomic warfare. And UA [United Artists] said they liked the idea but not that man. So I changed him to an Italian general who would lead the resistance against the Nazis and thereby facilitate an Allied invasion of Italy. UA wanted them to be full-out heroes with less subtlety than I might have sought. I had wanted them to unwittingly and ironically do something bad on their way to being heroes. But this was the majors, and with a half-million of their dollars at stake, I had a feeling these characters might lack nuance. I knew this was one of the drawbacks to working with the studios--story by committee.""', u""Due to an earthquake in Yugoslavia during filming, the production didn't get all of the Yugoslav soldiers they were promised could be used as extras, along with accompanying military equipment, because everything was needed for rescue and recovery work."", u'Filmed in Yugoslavia, with much of the location work done in the Croatian city of Dubrovnik.', u'A Yugoslav production assistant liked to fire a real gun in the air when clearing the set of people prior to action.', u'Yugoslav government officials demanded that Yugoslav Resistance (""Partisan"") characters wear red stars on their uniforms. Director Roger Corman tried to stop this, arguing that partisans would not identify themselves to the Nazis in this way, but the Yugoslavs had their own way. However, Corman found a solution to this visual problem--he had them edited out in post-production.', u'Director Roger Corman was given the largest budget he ever had to work with up until that time--approximately $600,000.', u'Roger Corman directed this movie in between making Poe films (i.e. filmed adaptations of Edgar Allan Poe horror stories) The Masque of the Red Death (1964) and The Tomb of Ligeia (1964), the latter of which was the last of his Poe adaptions.', u'Shot in 36 days.', u""Bobby Darin apparently quit just before production began.
