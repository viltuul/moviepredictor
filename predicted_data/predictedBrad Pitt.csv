What he discovered became legendary.', u'Based on the Best-Selling True Story']","[u'Director James Gray wrote to Francis Ford Coppola, who directed Apocalypse Now (1979), asking for advice about shooting in the jungle. Coppola\'s two-word reply was ""Don\'t go."" When Coppola decided to make Apocalypse Now, he received the same advice from Roger Corman.', u'Holland went swimming with the largest predators in the Amazon basin - inadvertently. ""I got in the river one day with the local kids and had the best day ever, but I didn\'t realize the water was filled with black caimans, which are like giant alligators,"" he says. ""The next day we were filming on the boat when I saw this big crocodile-looking thing in the river. Apparently they are very docile and don\'t really attack people, but to me this thing looked as mean as could be.""', u'The decision to shoot on 35mm may have been the film\'s saving grace, as the production team\'s computers proved no match for the oppressive jungle conditions. ""The humidity got to my Mac to the point where it wouldn\'t turn on anymore,"" Gray recalls. ""Looking back on it now, the film format worked out pretty well because it\'s a mechanical process. If I\'d relied on digital, the machines might have conked out completely and then I\'d be in real trouble.""', u'One particularly volatile night shoot brought home how quickly the situation can change in the jungle. As Gray recalls, ""we were filming a campfire scene between Charlie and Robert near the river when I started to hear people in the dark screaming, saying the river was about to rise. It didn\'t seem that big a deal to me; I figured fine, let the river rise, we\'ll be out of here in a few hours anyway. Six minutes later we were about to do close-ups when all of a sudden the river flooded the entire set in about 45 seconds. Everybody ran for the hills grabbing the camera, the film. Within two minutes, the area where we\'d just been shooting was totally under water. Fortunately, everyone was okay and I got what I needed. We were dealing with that kind of disruption on a daily basis.""', u'While filming in the jungle, Hunnam remembers a particularly nerve-wracking encounter one Saturday night following an exhausting six-day shooting week. ""I was staying in this little shack on this hill and woke up at three in the morning to this ungodly noise, like there was a pneumatic drill in my ear. An insect had burrowed into my ear and hit my eardrum so it couldn\'t go any further. It was a long beetle with wings. When it couldn\'t get back out, it kept trying to burrow further in and flapping its wings. That\'s what woke me up.""', u'Tom Holland broke his nose on his very last day of shooting.', u'Tom Holland had to wear a fake mustache for the movie as he said he was ""a child"" and couldn\'t grow one yet.', u'Although Fawcett vanished from view in 1925, his legend endured in fictional form, beginning with the character of Professor Challenger in The Lost World. Sir Conan Doyle modeled the intrepid hero of his 1912 novel on Fawcett, with whom he was close friends.', u'If shooting on 35mm film made perfect sense aesthetically, it posed significant logistical challenges in the middle of the Colombian jungle. ""It was an act of absolute hubris to shoot this picture on film,"" says Gray, who set up an elaborate routine in order to ship, process and review the film during production. ""First, we had to teach a young guy from Bogota how to load the film, because nobody really knows how to do that anymore,"" Gray recalls. ""Then, every day after we finished our shoot, they\'d put this film into a torn-up crappy cardboard box and load it onto a single-engine crop duster that would take off from this little runway."" After a series of plane changes, the film canisters eventually made their way to London. ""You\'re talking three flights every day just to get your film processed,"" Gray says. ""The next morning, there was always this sense of dread when the satellite phone rang and you\'d be thinking: \'I really hope the film arrived.\'""', u'Filming included so many gunshots and big explosions that it scared local farmers, who complained to local newspapers and tv stations.', u'When it came to filming in the jungle, ""It felt pretty sketchy at times,"" admits Pattinson. ""There were enormous spiders and snakes everywhere. And giant, gorgeous, bright blue frogs that will kill you. We were worried about Arbor Vipers that drop from trees and bite you in the face. After someone in the crew got bitten in the neck by a snake, they asked me and Charlie to go into virgin jungle with blunt machetes, and all the Colombians were telling us, \'There\'s a reason you don\'t go off the path. The animals will leave you alone until you start smashing the jungle.\'""', u'According to director James Gray, ""This idea of the intrepid explorer seems foreign to us now but people like Fawcett and Shackleton were the superheroes of their day,"" explains Gray. ""When I was growing up as a kid, Neil Armstrong made you slack-jawed with awe because he was willing to take unbelievable risks so he could walk on another celestial body. Well, back in the day, Fawcett and these other guys were like the astronauts in the sixties.""', u""According to James Gray, the story is less about adventure as it is about the characters. Percy Fawcett's father who had high social standing was basically a gambling addict who lost not one, but two family fortunes. Percy spends the better part of his adult life trying to answer for his father's misdeeds."", u'Most of Pattinson\'s scenes took place in uncomfortable situations in the jungle, where he forged a close rapport with Hunnam. ""Charlie and I would be an hour up river from the base camp basically covered in sand fleas all day,"" Pattinson says. ""It\'s definitely a bonding experience when there\'s no way to hide from extreme conditions. I remember we pushed a wooden raft with horses on it upstream. After just one day of that, you\'re completely done, yet the real guys did this for three years every single day, going against the river. It\'s complete madness.""', u'Principal photography on Lost City of Z began in August 2015, in Northern Ireland\'s breathtaking countryside. By October, however, Gray and his team had decamped for Santa Marta, Colombia, where cast and crew would endure a string of mishaps from flash floods and poisonous snakes to sweltering heat and humidity. The inhospitable rainforest environment helped cast and crew to channel Fawcett\'s adventure. ""It was hot, it was buggy, it was uncomfortable and I actually think that was a blessing,"" recalls Grann, who visited the set in Colombia. ""I think it was important to have some sense of what Fawcett actually experienced when they were performing these scenes.""', u'Charlie Hunnam lost 20-40 lb for the role of Col. Perceval Fawcett.', u'James Gray worked closely with Sienna Miller to ensure Nina was given full dimension and her own arc instead of being a passive wife character that Miller herself has often admitted she ends up playing.', u""According to director James Gray, the relationship between Fawcett and Nina could be a whole movie in itself. They first met at a gala and were set to be married when Fawcett's mother told him that Nina was impure. Fawcett rejected the marriage and Nina married somebody else who three years later on his deathbed told her to go marry Percy Fawcett, which she did. Gray wanted to cover that in the film but was unable to make it fit in the time frame he wanted."", u'Lead actor Charlie Hunnam wanted to eat and sleep in the battlefield trenches during filming the war scenes. He was not allowed however probably due to Insurance parameters.', u'According to director James Gray, Fawcett was the product of a brutal childhood. He was beaten terribly by the school system and was brought up in a very strict Victorian and puritanical household.', u'Benedict Cumberbatch was originally going to play Percy Fawcett, but had to drop out due to scheduling conflicts with Doctor Strange (2016).', u'James Gray cooked pasta for the cast and crew most nights while filming in the jungle.', u'Fascinated in part by Percy Fawcett\'s conflicted relationships with his son and wife, Gray also embraced the saga as a way of addressing issues still bedeviling the world today. ""The Lost City of Z involves politics in a way,"" Gray explains. ""The upper crust in Britain looked down on Fawcett because his father was an alcoholic who wasted the family fortune. They all looked down on the indigenous people. And even the indigenous people warred amongst each other. There was something powerful in this sad truth about human beings, that we feel the need to put each other in separate boxes of class and race and gender.""', u'Brad Pitt was originally slated to star as Percy Fawcett.', u'Gray cast Robert Pattinson to play Henry Costin, Fawcett\'s steadfast right-hand man and surveying partner. The Twilight star has admired Gray\'s filmmaking ever since he saw the director\'s 2007 gritty crime caper We Own the Night. ""I remember thinking that was one of the best pieces of filmmaking I\'d ever seen,"" Pattinson says. ""Then I saw Two Lovers, which is one of my favorite films. I love the performances James gets out of his actors. He shoots in this very kind of classical way so I really wanted to work with him.""', u'Several other Europeans attempted to explore the Amazon before Fawcett ever set foot in the South American rainforest. For example, Prussian naturalist Alexander von Humboldt assembled a massive collection of botanical and zoological specimens from the Brazilian Amazon in 1820. Englishman Henry Walter Bates spent 11 years in Amazonia throughout the 1850s, when he amassed an enormous collection of insects. Pre-dating these scientific ventures, Portuguese explorers colonized the territory in the 16th century and popularized the legend of El Dorado, City of Gold.', u'According to Sienna Miller, Nina was fluent in German and a committed suffragette, she represented a transitional feminist of sorts, confident in her own abilities yet totally committed to her husband\'s dream. ""They were Buddhists, which was relatively unheard of in that era, and very forward-thinking, progressive people.""', u'James Gray, known for such critically-hailed dramas as Little Odessa, The Yards, and Two Lovers, was excited at the prospect of turning Grann\'s narrative into a film, but he knew it would be an extremely ambitious undertaking. ""When I read the book, it seemed almost impossible to make,"" he said. ""The story involved the United Kingdom, World War I and, of course, the jungle. I thought, ""Any movie that\'s going to be worth anything has to cover all three of those big things, and that sounds impossible - so I\'d like to try.""', u'The role of Percy Fawcett was originally supposed to be played by Brad Pitt. However after discussions, both Brad and the director felt the role should be played by a British actor. This allowed Brad Pitt the opportunity to take the lead role in World War Z while they went on to sign Benedict Cumberbatch. Benedict was all set to go when his wife became pregnant and preferred not to give birth in the middle of the Amazon. This eventually led them to sign on with Charlie Hunnam.', u'To capture the dramatically varied settings of the Amazonian rainforest, proper English life and horrific World War I battles, Gray asked cinematographer Khondji to shoot on film stock. ""I wanted the movie to be almost like a throwback visually to the complexity of characterization you might see in the \'New Hollywood\' films of the 1970s,"" he says. ""I wanted to couple that with the epic sense of adventure David Lean brought to his films in the early \'60s. Of course, I should be so lucky, but that was the ambition.""', u'The decision to shoot on 35 mm film cost the production an additional $750,000.', u'First feature length film for Ian McDiarmid since Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (2005).', u""To achieve the lush look he wanted for The Lost City of Z, Gray enlisted French cinematographer Darius Khondji, an Academy Award nominee whose r\xe9sum\xe9 includes such diverse projects as Amour, Se7en, Evita, and Gray's own The Immigrant."", u""Although reports have never been officially confirmed, the publishers of the Indiana Jones children's book series did seek to make a seemingly self-referential connection between the two adventurers. In the 1991 book Indiana Jones and the Seven Veils, published after the release of Spielberg's Indiana Jones original trilogy, the bullwhip-wielding archaeologist travels to the Amazon after he discovers secret writings by Fawcett recounting his quest for a lost city."", u'Based on the best-selling true story novel written by The New Yorker staff writer David Grann, who researched the topic for his 2005 article.', u'According to director James Gray, the hardest thing in making a movie is the first 30 minutes, because in the first 30 minutes, every single aspect of the story needs to be established in great detail.', u'Percy Fawcett is in the artillery, but his red uniform is actually meant for infantry soldiers. This was intentional, as the director liked the way the colors worked in the scenes and allowed him to plausibly put Fawcett in the trenches in World War I later on.', u'Intent on capturing the reality faced by the actual explorers a century earlier, Gray committed to shooting in remote rainforest locations, which presented challenges from all directions - including the trees. ""The weird thing about the jungle is that it\'s verdant and lush and beautiful,"" he says. ""But people call the Amazon a counterfeit paradise. It\'s a tough environment and making a film there was no picnic.""', u'Previously rated R by the MPAA for ""brief violence.""', u""Brad Pitt's Plan B production company and Paramount Pictures optioned David Grann's The Lost City of Z. James Gray is directing the film, which stars Charlie Hunnam as Fawcett."", u'According to director James Gray, the boat trip was believed to be eight weeks long, filled with violent pick-pockets and knife fights.', u""Fawcett's passion for archaeological adventure coincided with the British Empire's avid interest in scientific exploration. Eager to investigate the farthest reaches of the planet in the early 20th century, the white establishment in Europe and the United States enthusiastically backed expeditions that promised to document previously uncharted territories."", u""The movie does technically follow the story of Fawcett's real-life expedition, but it is not historically accurate, especially when it comes to the portrayal of Fawcett himself and his motivations for the journey."", u'The book, written by David Grann, was sent to James Gray by Brad Pitt, Dede Gardner, and Jeremy Kleiner from the Plan B production company.', u'Charlie Hunnam plays the father of Tom Holland. In reality, Hunnam is 17 years older than Holland.', u'The Lost City of Z was adapted from a book written by David Grann.', u'Edward Ashley and Tom Holland both were in the movie In The Heart of the Sea as well.', u'The movie does technically follow the story of Fawcett\'s life and expeditions, but it is not historically accurate, especially when it comes to the portrayal of Fawcett himself and his motivations for the journey. Namely, Fawcett, who grew up in British India, was heavily influenced by mysticism and the occult teachings of Theosophists, a European pseudo-religious group whose fantastical ideas about the secret history of the world were highly popular and influential among the European and American elite at the turn of the 20th century. Although the movie shows Fawcett passionately defending his idea that the indigenous people of South America could have had a lost ancient civilization of their own that was as developed as, for instance, the Ancient Greece in Europe, this is not what the real Fawcett believed at all. Inspired by theosophical teachings, he thought that the lost jungle city in the Amazon might actually be one of the mythical lost cities hidden around the world, where the survivors of the apocalyptic event that destroyed the original, highly developed human society likened to Atlantis, hid away, and that this lost Amazonian city was inhabited by the so-called ""white Indians"" that were their descendants. This is also the reason why Fawcett named this city The Lost City of Z, since he believed that once the city is found, the mystical inhabitants will finally share their ancient secrets with the rest of the world and possibly change the human history forever. In other words, just like the letter Z is the final letter of the English alphabet, in Fawcett\'s mind, this lost Amazonian city symbolized the finality of human conquest for knowledge. All these beliefs directly led to Fawcett\'s decision to take his young son, who in Fawcett\'s mind was literally destined to help him find the lost city, and his son\'s best friend with him on his final journey despite the fact that the boys were not experienced explorers and that the expedition itself was ill prepared for the journey to begin with. Documentaries such as Secrets of the Dead: Lost in the Amazon (2011) cover these aspects of his life story. Another misconception is that he was probably killed by the Kalapalo tribe or some other hostile indigenous tribe from the area. This theory was especially promoted by George M. Dyott, an adventurer sent by the British Royal Society to look for Fawcett several years after Fawcett\'s disappearance. He decided to continue Fawcett\'s journey from Fawcett\'s last known location and ended up in the territory of a hostile indigenous tribe. He concluded that Fawcett must have run into them on his journey as well and got killed. Dyott survived the encounter with the hostile tribe and returned home to, based on his beliefs and findings, write a novel about Fawcett and his doomed expedition. The novel became popular and was later adapted into a movie called Manhunt in the Jungle (1958). Throughout the 20th century many people tried to find traces of Fawcett and his expedition but they either got killed as well or found absolutely nothing. However, eventually, some of the items Fawcett had with him on the journey began to resurface, primarily his compass and his family ring. The compass was found in the jungle, but the ring was found in a store in the same Brazilian state where Fawcett and his team went missing. The store owner claimed that Fawcett himself gave him the ring as payment on his previous failed expedition in 1920, but Fawcett\'s wife claimed that Fawcett brought the ring home with him after that journey. This strange inconstancy, the fact that all tribes from the area where Fawcett went missing keep denying to this very day that their people killed him, Fawcett\'s own reports from the doomed journey, which he regularly sent through local messengers to the Western press, claiming that he had established a good rapport with the local tribes, as well as the fact that everyone in the small Brazilian town which Fawcett last visited before heading off into the jungle knew exactly where he was going led to a more probable theory that the bandits who plagued the area in the 1920s killed Fawcett and stole his belongings, selling the ring to some local. Interestingly, in the 21st century, archaeologists have discovered traces of a possible indigenous civilization they named Kuhikugu that may have covered a vast area centuries ago, including the border regions between Bolivia and Brazil that Fawcett was hired to map. This is probably the source of the stories that Fawcett heard about a lost city in the Amazon. However, this civilization was closer to the typical South American tribal states of its era than anything that existed in Europe at the time.', u'Amazonian indigenous native Antonio Bolivar who played Old Karamakate in Academy Award Nominee film Embrace of the Serpent (2015), plays a minor role as an indigenous chief on the last tribe Colonel Fawcett and Jack encounter.']","[u'USA::15 October 2016 (New York Film Festival)', u'Germany::14 February 2017 (Berlin International Film Festival)', u'Belgium::15 March 2017', u'France::15 March 2017', u'UK::24 March 2017', u'Ireland::24 March 2017', u'Germany::30 March 2017', u'USA::6 April 2017 (Wisconsin Film Festival)', u'USA::8 April 2017 (Cleveland International Film Festival)', u'USA::9 April 2017 (RiverRun International Film Festival)', u'USA::9 April 2017 (San Francisco International Film Festival)', u'USA::14 April 2017 (limited)', u'Israel::20 April 2017', u'Singapore::20 April 2017', u'Canada::21 April 2017 (limited)', u'Lithuania::21 April 2017', u'Turkey::21 April 2017', u'USA::21 April 2017', u'Georgia::27 April 2017', u'Cambodia::27 April 2017', u'Kuwait::27 April 2017', u'Netherlands::27 April 2017', u'Portugal::4 May 2017', u'Spain::5 May 2017', u'New Zealand::18 May 2017', u'India::19 May 2017', u'Vietnam::19 May 2017', u'Indonesia::31 May 2017', u'Brazil::1 June 2017', u'China::2 June 2017', u'Estonia::2 June 2017', u'Taiwan::2 June 2017', u'Philippines::7 June 2017', u'Greece::8 June 2017', u'Italy::17 June 2017 (Biografilm Festival)', u'Italy::22 June 2017', u'New Zealand::22 July 2017 (New Zealand International Film Festival)', u'Chile::3 August 2017', u'Sweden::7 August 2017 (DVD premiere)', u'Denmark::10 August 2017', u'Australia::24 August 2017', u'France::6 September 2017 (Deauville Film Festival)', u'Peru::14 September 2017', u'South Korea::21 September 2017', u'Argentina::28 September 2017', u'Mexico::29 September 2017', u'Bulgaria::13 October 2017 (Cinelibri International Book&Movie Festival)']",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

It was conceived as a multi-character love story set in the Middle East during the First World War which begins with a prologue set in prehistoric times. Eventually, Malick removed the WWI narrative and the prehistoric prologue became the whole film, with the narrative becoming more metaphorical and involving a prehistoric Minotaur or a ""sleeping god"" resting in the depths of the water while dreaming about the origins and formation of the universe.', u'The visual effects team of the film were presented with four main visual challenges: (1) creating the astrophysical imagery before the solar system we know existed, and then conceiving and visualizing the futurescape of our universe, referencing the latest theories about our cosmic destiny; (2) representing the protoplanetary disk that formed and condensed to become our solar system and the planets it contains; (3) imaging the first unicellular forms of life in all their majesty and motion, which would learn to replicate and form increasingly complex organisms; and (4) re-conceiving animals that no longer roam the earth, convincingly blending them with analog equivalents where they exist today.', u'The film actually started shooting in 2003 when renowned nature cinematographer Paul Atkins (who also happened to be the director of photography of the film) alerted the filmmakers that volcanoes were erupting in Hawaii. So, they sent him off to capture some of the most extraordinary shots in the film, as molten lava bursts up under the ocean. One cameraman took the IMAX camera so close to exploding magma that his boots melted.', u'Emma Thompson was attached to the film before Cate Blanchett signed on.', u'In order to overcome the visual challenges of the process, Terrence Malick and Dan Glass, visual effects supervisor for the film, created what they called ""Skunkworks"" for photographic experimentation. According to Glass, these were literally chemical experiments conducted to see how various liquids, dyes, gasses and fluids might behave while being filmed at high-speed. Malick and Glass used everything from gels and glass, to smoke machines and fluid tanks, to create a whole range of effects. One of their main inspirations was the rich work of 19th-century painter Albert Bierstadt, to the extent that Malick referred to their work as ""Bierstadting"".', u""According to Dan Glass, visual effects supervisor for the film, Terrence Malick was saying that he wanted the feeling that every shot in the film was drawn by a different artist's hand."", u'According to producer Sarah Green, ""Terry has been working on this idea - and, in fact, on shots for this movie - since he began making films in the \'70s. There\'s actually footage in this film from the \'70s that he\'s carefully kept. It\'s been a passion of his for his whole filmmaking career to make a film that really examines our relationship to nature, and our place with nature, as humans."" Malick shot footage for the film whenever opportunities presented themselves over the years, with the producing team coming on board 12 years ago. The process came into focus over the last year, with the film solidifying and gelling into two different versions - the documentary and the IMAX experience. [2016]', u'In producing and finding imagery for the film, Malick found great resources within the scientific community. ""There\'s many different astrophysical shots, as you\'ll see, many of which are created from original high-res imagery from the Hubble Space Telescope,"" said producer Nicolas Gonda, ""In addition to that, and through the guidance of our Visual Effects Supervisor, Dan Glass, we also created live, analogue re-creations of events telescopes wouldn\'t be able to see.""

When Beatty opened the envelope, apparently becoming aware of the mistake, he hesitated to announce a winner. He then handed the card to Dunaway who announced the heavily favored La La Land as the winner for Best Picture. The three nominated producers Jordan Horowitz, Marc Platt and Fred Berger as well as the whole cast and crew of the film went up on stage. Horowitz gave his thanks first, up next was Platt during whose speech the mistake became known when the ceremony\'s producers ran through the crowd on stage looking for the faulty as well as correct envelopes. It became clear that Horowitz was handed the wrong envelope by Beatty, which stated ""Emma Stone, La La Land, Best Actress in a Leading Role"", upon accepting the award, while the right envelope announcing Moonlight as the real Best Picture winner had to be brought on-stage from backstage and was finally handed to Beatty. The crowd on stage became slowly aware of the mistake and, despite being already aware of the not winning, Berger still gave a speech thanking his family and ending his speech by stating ""We lost by the way, but, you know."" Horowitz, also being told about the mistake, stepped up to the microphone again and finally revealed to the public that Moonlight actually had won, showing the correct Best Picture card to the audience as well as the camera. Beatty additionally cleared up that he was handed the wrong envelope and also announced Moonlight as winner of Best Picture. After this announcement, the cast and crew of La La Land slowly left the stage, while the three producers handed their awards over to the team from Moonlight, which was able to finally give their speeches.

The final test was manning a real tank during a combat exercise. Brad Pitt, who was much older than his cast mates, made sure that he participated in all of the physical training alongside the other actors.', u""At 50, Brad Pitt is considerably older than the average WWII NCO (non-commissioned officer), who likely would have been in his mid 20s to early 30s. Considering his age, choice of sidearm, and long service record mentioned in the film, it's entirely possible that his character is a WWI veteran. It would also explain why his character knew German before the war started. However, the scene where the tank drives past an entire German town on fire originally ran longer, and had Pitt's character explaining that his mother originally came from a small German town, not unlike the one they are just passing. This would imply he learned German from his mother,"", u""During filming, Brad Pitt and Shia LaBeouf almost got in a real fight with Scott Eastwood while the cameras were rolling.

It was miserable, but we loved it"".', u'It has been reported that Shia LaBeouf became a Christian while shooting this movie. His actual words were, ""I found God during \'Fury\'. I became a Christian man, and not in a fucking bullshit way--in a very real way. I could have just said the prayers that were on the page, but . . . it\'s a full-blown exchange of heart, a surrender of control.""

This would have been the original-issue uniform. Norman wears the newer M1943 Field Jacket, distinguishable by its many large pockets and greener color.

However, the L55 M1A2 76mm gun mounted on Fury was capable of penetrating the front armor of the Tiger tank at ranges up to 700 meters, more if HVAP ammo was used.', u""Fury is easily distinguished by the two machine guns fitted to the top of the turret. It was a common practice among tankers. Someone who wanted to use the top .50-cal. machine gun would have to get out and stand on the engine deck, exposing themselves. Another gun would be mounted in front of the commander's hatch so the commander could use it without exposing himself. One tank known to have the extra .30-cal. gun is Col. Creighton Williams Abrams Thunderbolt VIII."", u""The red air-recognition panels on the engine decks of the tanks are clearly visible.

Logan Lerman admitted that the experience ""left scars I\'m healing from.""', u""The scene where Sgt. Collier (Brad Pitt) and Norman (Logan Lerman) meet for the first time originally ran longer, and gave some additional insight in Collier's initial cool demeanor toward him. In the scene's unedited version (included as an extra on the BluRay version), Collier showed an even more antagonistic response to him, especially upon hearing his name. In a later truncated scene, Collier explained that his younger brother, who died in a car accident caused by Collier himself, was also called Norman."", u'The presence of severe burn scars on the back of Sgt. Collier (Brad Pitt) remains unexplained in the finished movie. However, the scene where Collier and Norman (Logan Lerman) have a conversation while driving past a burning town originally ran much longer, and contained a significant character moment. Collier would have explained that he got the scars during a car accident as a young man. He had gotten into a drunken fight during a festival once, and while getting away from the sheriff with his truck, he subsequently crashed it, causing the death of his younger brother and fiancee who were in it. The car\'s engine ended up on his own back, causing severe burns. The judge who presided over his case offered him the option to enlist in the army and ""die for his country"", which he chose over jail time.', u""The death scene of 'The Old Man', Captain Waggoner (played by Jason Isaacs), was omitted from the film. The last time he is seen in the movie is after his final conversation with Sgt. Collier (Brad Pitt) in the small German village, just before it is bombed during an air raid.

That became the day that D.O.M.A. was overturned, marking a momentous advancement for gay rights. As a celebration broke out, Larry Kramer grabbed the microphone and said ""We did it!""', u'For the 2011 Broadway premiere of the play ""The Normal Heart"", Playwright Larry Kramer wrote a flyer called ""Please Know"" (which he often handed out to exiting audience members himself). ""Please Know"" explained that most of the events and characters in the play were based on real events, and people. Some of the real people he said his characters were based on included: Paul Popham, one of the founders of the Gay Men\'s Health Crisis (the basis for Bruce); Dr. Linda Laubenstein, an early A.I.D.S. researcher (the basis for Emma); and Rodger McFarlane, Creator of the crisis hotline, that was the precursor to the G.M.H.C. and gay rights activist (the basis for Tommy). Like McFarlane, Tommy is a Southerner (McFarlane was born and raised in South Alabama). Like Laubenstein, Emma uses a wheelchair (Laubenstein was left paraplegic after a childhood bout with polio). Although this was not mentioned in Kramer\'s handout, the character of Felix also had a real-life inspiration: John Duka, who, during the early 1980s, wrote a column in the New York Times\' Thursday Style section titled ""Notes on Fashion"". Duka had been openly gay while working at New York Magazine, but upon his move to the Times in 1980, he felt he needed to re-closet himself, because of the Times\' then-more-conservative attitudes. Also like Felix, he also had a brief marriage to a woman.

This is an in-joke reference to a section of Max Brooks\' ""Zombie Survival Guide"" (the book that preceded ""World War Z"") which discussed the best weapons to use when fighting zombies. The book considers both options superior to the gun, which Segen also takes as a backup.', u'""Segen"" in Hebrew literally means ""Lieutenant"".', u""The screenplay for this film was featured in the 2007 Blacklist; a list of the 'most liked' unmade scripts of the year."", u'A total of 85 prop machine guns, rifles and pistols to be used for scenes filmed in Hungary, were confiscated by counter-terrorism customs officers in Budapest, Hungary after being flown in from London. Hungarian authorities said the guns could be activated by removing the screws filling the end of the barrels. Hungarian law requires weapons to be deactivated only if the process is irreversible. The movie\'s weapons supervisor, \'Bela Gajdos\', commented that a permit for the weapons had been issued by Hungarian police. Reports claimed that main actor Brad Pitt was ""furious"" at the seizure but producers said it had not delayed filming.', u'Brad Pitt said of his involvement in the film - ""This whole thing started because I just wanted to do a film that my boys could see before they turned 18 - one that they would like, anyways.

The wrap-up team found a stack of purchase orders for extras that was casually tossed aside in a drawer which was unaccounted for.', u'In a high-six-figure deal, Paramount Pictures acquired screen rights to the Max Brooks novel ""World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War."" Brooks\' follow-up to the satirical ""The Zombie Survival Guide"" sparked a bidding battle, with Warner Brothers & Leonardo DiCaprio\'s Appian Way on the other side of the table from Paramount & Brad Pitt\'s Plan B.', u'Paramount executive Marc Evans, director Marc Forster and Adam Goodman, the president of production, did not like the original cut (which has the Russian ending that culminated in a big battle between zombies and humans). All three felt that it was incoherent, abrupt, and a typical Hollywood blockbuster ending that only served to surpass the Jerusalem scenes in scale. They brought in Damon Lindelof to view a rough cut of the film, and he suggested to them either to add new scenes to improve the coherence, or do a complete third-act rewrite and risk additional resource plus re-shoots. Lindelof recalled: ""So when I gave them those two roads and they sounded more interested in Road B, I was like, \'To be honest with you, good luck selling that to Paramount."" Fortunately, the studio agreed not to spend additional money on finishing the special effects of this climax, but instead use it on a simpler, more personal and tension-driven ending.', u'Marc Forster states that he prefers the extended, unrated cut of the film. For him it\'s not just about the additional blood and gore, it\'s about the overall intensity compared to the PG-13-rated version. Forster says that although he\'s proud of the theatrical version, he felt a bit ""handcuffed"" when he was trying to deliver the toned-down PG-13-rated version.', u'Filming took place in several areas of the UK including Cornwall, where the UN control room scene was filmed alongside scenes on the Ministry of Defence (MOD) Primary Casualty Receiving Facility (PCRF), RFA Argus (AS on the flight-deck). Filming also took place in Glasgow with the streets made to look like those in Philadelphia, USA with many American cars, trucks, taxis and street signage shipped in from the USA. Filming took place in Malta, at Valletta, and elsewhere.', u'The original cinematographer was Robert Richardson. He left the film near the end of principal photography to begin working on Django Unchained (2012), so shooting was completed by Newton Thomas Sigel. Reshoots were shot by Ben Seresin. Richardson, who received sole credit in early promotional material, later had his name removed from the film, reportedly because it was converted to 3-D against his wishes, and Seresin was given sole credit instead.', u""Brad Pitt was most intrigued by the book's geopolitical aspects (what with his then-partner Angelina Jolie being a UN Goodwill Ambassador and all), and his production company Plan B, together with Paramount, spent $1 million on the film rights. However, it soon became clear that much of the geopolitics that Pitt was interested in would have to be dropped if they wanted the story to come together on screen. Furthermore, Pitt's production company, Plan B, had never taken on a project of this size, its experience limited to eclectic, low-budget dramas; their biggest film before this was Eat Pray Love (2010)."", u'When Gerry goes to South Korea, the U.S. soldiers there are wearing 2nd Infantry Division patches on their uniforms.

There were rumors that Forster's notes for Pitt had to be relayed through an intermediary. Forster later learned of these stories and has openly denied all of them. He admitted that there was a fair amount of tension over the reshoots and the delayed release of the movie, but ultimately everyone was on the same page with the new direction of the story. Forster suspected that the media spread the rumors in the wake of earlier bad publicity about production troubles, inflated budgets and reshoots."", u'In the movie, Daniella Kertesz portrays a Lieutenant in the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF).

The review also noted the film appears stylistically similar to Children of Men (2006), following Gerry Lane as he travels the post-war world and interviews survivors of the zombie war who are ""starting to wonder if survival is a victory of any kind."" This early screenplay, however, was a more literal adaptation of the book, and was substantially rewritten twice as a more epic account of the zombie outbreak, with more focus on action scenes. Despite the change, Ain\'t It Cool News later posted a favorable review of the altered film.', u""If it seems odd that the Air Belarus pilots know English, you'll be pleased to know that English is the internationally accepted language for pilots. With the exception of smaller air strips where the potential for confusion is minimal."", u""Marc Forster and J. Michael Straczynski clashed throughout the writing process. Forster wanted to focus on the action, which Straczynski felt detracted from the story's main themes; he was more interested in remaining faithful to the book, focusing on the characters and the global reaction to the Zombie Apocalypse. Straczynski was eventually fired and replaced with Matthew Michael Carnahan, who made the film an action-adventure focused on a UN field specialist named Gerry Lane, dropping the book's first-person accounts. Brad Pitt had already been cast as Gerry before any script was written; in fact, Pitt had read the book and obtained the rights to it, and approached Forster about a possible adaptation."", u""Shooting in Malta for the Jerusalem scenes was a nightmare, with two film crews working side-by-side, hundreds of extras, and all sorts of minor costs escalating the budget. One day, shooting had to be delayed for several hours because the caterer hadn't prepared enough food. When work in Malta finished, the wrap-up crew found a stack of purchase orders related to the cast and extras that had been casually tossed into a desk drawer and forgotten; the amount totalled in the millions of dollars. And all the while, the script still wasn't finished, with work still being done on the third act."", u""It was hoped that Marc Forster would be able to focus on story and characters while his crew could guide him on action and effects, but not only was he unable to bring his usual team with him, the lack of a strong leader at the head of the project produced a muddled vision for what the film would be like. As late as three weeks before shooting was to begin in June 2011, Forster hadn't even decided yet on what the zombies would look like or how they would behave."", u""Brad Pitt's schedule conflicted with his commitment to starring in Killing Them Softly (2012), and he also took time off to spend time with his family, pushing production back even further."", u'The production company was looking to recruit 2,000 local extras for the shoot in Glasgow. At least 3,000 people showed up at a casting call.', u""Reunites Brad Pitt with David Morse after Twelve Monkeys (1995). Both worked in the movie, although they didn't share a scene together."", u'In March 2013, it was reported that Paramount changed a scene in the film in which the characters speculate that the zombie outbreak originated in mainland China in hopes of landing a distribution deal in the country. However, an executive familiar with upcoming releases in China later told The Wrap in June 2013 that a cut of the film was rejected by Chinese censors. A Paramount executive contended that he was ""unaware of any rejection"", explaining, ""We have submitted one version and have yet to receive a response.""', u""Peter Capaldi's character was a late addition to the script."", u'At the Helicopter crash scene the buildings are the same as in the ""Midnight Express"" Turkish prison. ""Midnight Express"" was also shot in Malta, as were ""World War Z"" Israel scenes.', u""Marc Forster described the film as reminiscent of 1970s conspiracy thrillers like All the President's Men (1976).

The book is a complete guide on how to protect yourself from the living dead.', u'This is the second movie that Brad Pitt and David Morse have starred in together that concerns the release of a deadly virus that kills a large portion of the human race. The first was Twelve Monkeys.', u'There is a book on the table at the research facility titled ""By the sea"". Brad Pitt and his then-partner Angelina Jolie later produced and starred in a movie called Meren \xe4\xe4rell\xe4 (2015), but it is unrelated to this book.', u'Italian censorship visa # 107487 delivered on 24-6-2013.', u'Originally, the film had a different ending: the plane lands in Moscow rather than crashing in Wales. The passengers are rounded up, and the elderly and sick are executed. Gerry is drafted into the Russian army. An unknown period of time passes, and we see Gerry fighting the zombies. He realizes the zombies are weak in the cold. The film ended with him getting back to the USA and leading a D-Day like invasion against the undead on the Oregon coast. The ending that was used instead made the movie less brutal and ended it with a glimpse of hope.', u'Matthew Fox had a bigger role in the film. He was a supporting character who in the end would be set up as a (human) villain for World War Z 2. Due to the constant re-writes and editing, his role in the final cut was reduced down to only 5 lines of dialogue.', u""The rewrite was almost at 60 pages long and cost an additional $20 million more. In addition to the new opening and the rewritten third act, the following snippets were added by Drew Goddard and Damon Lindelof, with Christopher McQuarrie doing uncredited dialog sharpening: At the family breakfast, the TV news report of the zombie sighting.Rachel's asthma attackGerry's phone call to Karen from South Korea to Jerusalem"", u""J. Michael Straczynski's early draft of the script stayed closer to the source material. That version followed Gerry Lane, a UN worker tasked with investigating the failures that led to the outbreak so that they can be avoided in the future. The bulk of the narrative consisted of interviews with prominent figures and flashbacks to their role in the initial outbreak, largely taken from the book. This was framed by Gerry's journey around the globe to meet these individuals, showing the current condition of the human race, and flashbacks to the Lane family's struggle to survive in the wilderness in the early days of the war."", u""In the beginning of the trailer released in March 2013, while Gerry's family is having breakfast the radio in the background mentions a flight which landed without permission before martial law is declared in Russia. This is likely the infamous Flight 575 alluded to in the book. Before Flight 575, a few people were able to smuggle infected loved ones out of China, where the authorities were rounding up the afflicted to control the disease. Some unspecified zombie disaster befalls Flight 575, leading to greatly increased scrutiny and restrictions. (In J. Michael Straczynski's script, the pilots lose contact with the cabin, but don't know that it's because the plane is overrun with zombies. They make an emergency landing in the US, and an unsuspecting SWAT team is overwhelmed as soon as they open the cabin door.)"", u""The shot where the zombie pins Brad Pitt down and shakes his head and splattering blood all over Pitt's face is the same as Pitt does in Fight Club (1999), to Lou."", u'Paramount, after seeing how out-of-control production had gotten in Malta, ordered a scaling back of the budget, forcing the production to scrap a number of scenes. Members of the production criticized the third act as ""Rambo vs. zombies"", losing the character-driven drama of the rest of the film, and production wrapped with the knowledge that rewrites and reshoots were inevitable.', u'The climactic battle scene in Russia, for which there was 12 minutes of footage, had Gerry Lane fighting through zombies more like ""a warrior hero"" than ""the sympathetic family man"" of the earlier acts. The second-unit director, Simon Crane, said, ""It wasn\'t character-driven anymore... [The filmmakers] really needed to think about what they wanted to do with the third act.""

In the original book, Tejada\'s free swinging ways and relatively high strikeout rate was something of a point of contention, with the Dominican shortstop telling Billy Beane and other Athletics\' members that ""You can\'t walk your way off the island"".', u'At the meeting where Billy Beane discusses his views on new players with Peter Brand in the room for the first time, the name-bar ""PRATT C"", the name of actor Chris Pratt, can be seen on the whiteboard behind one of the board members.

At various points from the 1950s until his death a few years ago, King called Oakland Raiders, Golden State Warriors, A\'s and early on San Francisco Giants games. Current Oakland Raiders announcer Greg Papa was also the television play-by-play announcer for the Oakland A\'s from 1989 to 2003 and is the host of the San Francisco Giants pre and post games shows. Also heard are Ken Korach, then King\'s second fiddle who later took over the #1 play-by-play role, and color man Ray Fosse, a veteran of the 1970s Oakland championship teams who continued to call games for the A\'s through the 2013 season. Scott Hatteberg sometimes fills in for Ray Fosse as a color commentator.', u'Billy Beane refers to John Poloni as ""Rocco"". This is a reference to Jack McGee\'s father who played minor league baseball and whose nickname was ""Rocco"".', u'The film cast includes three Oscar winners: Brad Pitt, Spike Jonze and Philip Seymour Hoffman; and one Oscar nominee: Jonah Hill.', u'One of the most persistently negative faceless voices attacking Beane\'s approach to team building in the film is performed by noted character actor Ron Canada. The character who gives a sharp rebuke to the A\'s after the climactic playoff loss, was intended to evoke the views of baseball traditionalist like Hall of Famer Joe Morgan. In fact Canada auditioned as a Morgan voice match. Director Miller worked with Canada, a hard core fan of the game over three recording sessions to portray the broadcast scoldings from the game\'s conservatives. Some of that dialog is the result of mock interviews of Canada\'s ""character"" by Miller in the recording studio.Though not credited, Canada is proud to have contributed something to what he calls ""a sports film for grownups."".', u""Billy Beane is portrayed as a lonely divorc\xe9e in the film, though in real life, he had actually remarried.

This marks the first feature film Trumbull has provided the effects for in 29 years, his last being Blade Runner (1982).', u'The critic Jim Emerson got word of what Terrence Malick intended the sequence of dinosaurs to mean, by way of the visual effects supervisor in charge of that very sequence who is Michael L. Fink. Emerson describes what he learned from Fink; ""The premise of the four-shot scene was to depict the birth of consciousness (what some have called the ""birth of compassion"")-the first moment in which a living creature made a conscious decision to choose what Michael described as ""right from wrong, good from evil."" Or, perhaps, a form of altruism over predatory instinct"".', u'Emmanuel Lubezki explained Terrence Malick\'s approach to film by saying ""Photography is not used to illustrate dialogue or a performance"" but instead is used ""to capture emotion so that the movie is very experiential"". So the film, with Lubezki\'s own words, is ""meant to trigger tons of memories, like a scent or a perfume"".', u""The butterfly that landed on Mrs. O'Brien's (Jessica Chastain) hands was not CG but a real one.

Penn said ""I didn\'t at all find on the screen the emotion of the script, which is the most magnificent one that I\'ve ever read. A clearer and more conventional narrative would have helped the film without, in my opinion, lessening its beauty and its impact.

In short, she is my PERSON....something happened to my heart and mind in the days and weeks following Rayya\'s diagnosis.

And I have no more time for denying that truth. The thought of someday sitting in a hospital room with her, holding her hand and watching her slide away, without ever having let her (or myself!) know the extent of my true feelings for her...well, that thought was unthinkable. Here is the thing about truth: Once you see it, you cannot un-see it. So that truth, once it came to my heart\'s attention, could not be ignored....For those of you who are doing the math here, and who are wondering if this situation is why my marriage came to an end this spring, the simple answer is yes. ... So. Here is where we stand now: Rayya and I are together. I love her, and she loves me. I\'m walking through this cancer journey with her, not only as her friend, but as her partner.

During a promotional press event for the movie, Jolie responded to the criticisms by saying, ""the idea is, if you ask Marianne, because she did address that... if you did actually want to find somebody that was her exact makeup, she\'s actually majority Dutch, and she\'s as black as she is Chinese, and she\'s Cuban, and she\'s French.

His FBI handler was convicted of multiple felonies.', u""DIRECTOR TRADEMARK (reference): When Sullivan turns on the shower before Madolyn starts to listen to Costigan's tape, the shots are the same exact three shots in Psycho (1960)'s infamous shower scene."", u'The rat at the end is completely digital.', u'at around 5 mins) Right after the time skip in the beginning of the movie, during the first lesson at the police academy, the teacher is elaborating on the details of a gunshot wound to the head, which is the leading cause of the vast majority of deaths throughout the course of the rest of the movie.', u'At the end of the movie when Billy brings the tape to Madolyn, we can deduce that the child is not from Colin Sullivan, but from Costigan. She wants to tell him something, but he leaves right before she does. Sullivan also has, during a scene in the film, some ""issues with what happened last night"". Madolyn then sleeps with Billy.', u'Martin Scorsese expresses the highly unpleasant experience in making the film. He states ""Moral Ground Zero, I call it, all the characters killed at the end, basically everyone, and there was no place to go, after that. You know, I hardly did any press for that film. I was tired of it. I felt it was maddening. I mean, I like the picture,"" he continues, ""but the process of making it, particularly in the post-production, was highly unpleasant. I don\'t care how much I\'m being paid, it\'ll kill me. I\'ll die. Very simply.""', u""at around 2h 20 mins) In the final scene, as Sullivan walks to his apartment, the floor has large patterned xs on the carpet. He walks over two of them as he approaches the door. It's as if to say strike one, strike two, and strike three being the coup de grace from Dignam."", u'When Billy Costigan interrogates the drug-addicted bank robber (Joseph Riccobene), who reveals to him that Frank Costello is an FBI informant, the television set in the bank robber\'s living room is playing the final scene from The Informer (1935). The movie has a similar plot, about an Irish nationalist, Gypo Nolan (played by Victor McLaglen in an Oscar-winning role), who turns informant, and feels guilty after betraying a friend to the Irish ""Black and Tan"" police force.']","[u'USA::26 September 2006 (New York City, New York)\n (premiere)', u'Brazil::4 October 2006 (Festival do Rio BR)', u'Philippines::4 October 2006', u'Russia::5 October 2006', u'Canada::6 October 2006', u'UK::6 October 2006', u'Hong Kong::6 October 2006', u'Ireland::6 October 2006', u'Taiwan::6 October 2006', u'Ukraine::6 October 2006', u'USA::6 October 2006', u'Indonesia::11 October 2006', u'Australia::12 October 2006', u'Kazakhstan::12 October 2006', u'New Zealand::12 October 2006', u'Singapore::12 October 2006', u'Thailand::12 October 2006', u'Estonia::13 October 2006', u'Latvia::13 October 2006', u'Italy::15 October 2006 (Rome Film Festival)', u'Kuwait::23 October 2006', u'Czech Republic::26 October 2006', u'Bulgaria::27 October 2006', u'Spain::27 October 2006', u'Iceland::27 October 2006', u'Italy::27 October 2006', u'Poland::27 October 2006', u'Israel::2 November 2006', u'Malaysia::2 November 2006', u'Slovakia::2 November 2006', u'Norway::3 November 2006', u'Romania::3 November 2006', u'Serbia::6 November 2006', u'Egypt::8 November 2006', u'Hungary::9 November 2006', u'Netherlands::9 November 2006', u'Portugal::9 November 2006', u'Brazil::10 November 2006', u'Denmark::10 November 2006', u'Finland::10 November 2006', u'Argentina::16 November 2006', u'Mexico::17 November 2006', u'Panama::17 November 2006', u'Venezuela::17 November 2006', u'Iran::18 November 2006', u'Greece::23 November 2006', u'South Korea::23 November 2006', u'Turkey::24 November 2006', u'Japan::26 November 2006 (Tokyo International Cine City Festival)', u'France::29 November 2006', u'Uruguay::1 December 2006', u'Germany::7 December 2006', u'Sweden::13 December 2006 (Lucia Movie Night)', u'Belgium::27 December 2006', u'Sweden::12 January 2007', u'Japan::20 January 2007', u'USA::26 January 2007 (re-release)', u'Iran::1 February 2007 (Fajr International Film Festival)', u'Argentina::22 February 2007 (re-release)', u'Brazil::2 March 2007 (re-release)', u'Egypt::7 March 2007 (re-release)']",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The review also noted the film appears stylistically similar to Children of Men (2006), following Gerry Lane as he travels the post-war world and interviews survivors of the zombie war who are ""starting to wonder if survival is a victory of any kind.""

Forster wanted to focus on the action, which Straczynski felt detracted from the story's main themes; he was more interested in remaining faithful to the book, focusing on the characters and the global reaction to the Zombie Apocalypse. Straczynski was eventually fired and replaced with Matthew Michael Carnahan, who made the film an action-adventure focused on a UN field specialist named Gerry Lane, dropping the book's first-person accounts. Brad Pitt had already been cast as Gerry before any script was written; in fact, Pitt had read the book and obtained the rights to it, and approached Forster about a possible adaptation."", u""Shooting in Malta for the Jerusalem scenes was a nightmare, with two film crews working side-by-side, hundreds of extras, and all sorts of minor costs escalating the budget. One day, shooting had to be delayed for several hours because the caterer hadn't prepared enough food.

And all the while, the script still wasn't finished, with work still being done on the third act."", u""It was hoped that Marc Forster would be able to focus on story and characters while his crew could guide him on action and effects, but not only was he unable to bring his usual team with him, the lack of a strong leader at the head of the project produced a muddled vision for what the film would be like. As late as three weeks before shooting was to begin in June 2011, Forster hadn't even decided yet on what the zombies would look like or how they would behave."", u""Brad Pitt's schedule conflicted with his commitment to starring in Killing Them Softly (2012), and he also took time off to spend time with his family, pushing production back even further."", u'The production company was looking to recruit 2,000 local extras for the shoot in Glasgow.

Brad Pitt and his then-partner Angelina Jolie later produced and starred in a movie called Meren \xe4\xe4rell\xe4 (2015), but it is unrelated to this book.', u'Italian censorship visa # 107487 delivered on 24-6-2013.', u'Originally, the film had a different ending: the plane lands in Moscow rather than crashing in Wales. The passengers are rounded up, and the elderly and sick are executed. Gerry is drafted into the Russian army. An unknown period of time passes, and we see Gerry fighting the zombies. He realizes the zombies are weak in the cold. The film ended with him getting back to the USA and leading a D-Day like invasion against the undead on the Oregon coast. The ending that was used instead made the movie less brutal and ended it with a glimpse of hope.', u'Matthew Fox had a bigger role in the film. He was a supporting character who in the end would be set up as a (human) villain for World War Z 2. Due to the constant re-writes and editing, his role in the final cut was reduced down to only 5 lines of dialogue.', u""The rewrite was almost at 60 pages long and cost an additional $20 million more. In addition to the new opening and the rewritten third act, the following snippets were added by Drew Goddard and Damon Lindelof, with Christopher McQuarrie doing uncredited dialog sharpening: At the family breakfast, the TV news report of the zombie sighting.Rachel's asthma attackGerry's phone call to Karen from South Korea to Jerusalem"", u""J. Michael Straczynski's early draft of the script stayed closer to the source material. That version followed Gerry Lane, a UN worker tasked with investigating the failures that led to the outbreak so that they can be avoided in the future. The bulk of the narrative consisted of interviews with prominent figures and flashbacks to their role in the initial outbreak, largely taken from the book. This was framed by Gerry's journey around the globe to meet these individuals, showing the current condition of the human race, and flashbacks to the Lane family's struggle to survive in the wilderness in the early days of the war."", u""In the beginning of the trailer released in March 2013, while Gerry's family is having breakfast the radio in the background mentions a flight which landed without permission before martial law is declared in Russia. This is likely the infamous Flight 575 alluded to in the book. Before Flight 575, a few people were able to smuggle infected loved ones out of China, where the authorities were rounding up the afflicted to control the disease. Some unspecified zombie disaster befalls Flight 575, leading to greatly increased scrutiny and restrictions. (In J. Michael Straczynski's script, the pilots lose contact with the cabin, but don't know that it's because the plane is overrun with zombies. They make an emergency landing in the US, and an unsuspecting SWAT team is overwhelmed as soon as they open the cabin door.)"", u""The shot where the zombie pins Brad Pitt down and shakes his head and splattering blood all over Pitt's face is the same as Pitt does in Fight Club (1999), to Lou."", u'Paramount, after seeing how out-of-control production had gotten in Malta, ordered a scaling back of the budget, forcing the production to scrap a number of scenes. Members of the production criticized the third act as ""Rambo vs. zombies"", losing the character-driven drama of the rest of the film, and production wrapped with the knowledge that rewrites and reshoots were inevitable.', u'The climactic battle scene in Russia, for which there was 12 minutes of footage, had Gerry Lane fighting through zombies more like ""a warrior hero"" than ""the sympathetic family man"" of the earlier acts. The second-unit director, Simon Crane, said, ""It wasn\'t character-driven anymore... [The filmmakers] really needed to think about what they wanted to do with the third act."" When the studio agreed to re-write and re-shoot the film to conclude with a more personal ending, director Marc Forster admitted he was relieved and happy, because it came much closer to how he and Brad Pitt had originally envisioned the film to be.', u""The filmmakers had initially filmed a climactic battle scene set in Russia, and the crew moved to Budapest to film it there. This ending was scrapped, but parts of it ended up in the film's epilogue.""]","[u'UK::2 June 2013 (London)\n (premiere)', u'France::15 June 2013 (Champs-Elys\xe9es Film Festival)', u'Serbia::18 June 2013 (Belgrade Blockbuster Review)', u'Egypt::19 June 2013', u'Indonesia::19 June 2013', u'New Zealand::19 June 2013', u'Philippines::19 June 2013', u'United Arab Emirates::20 June 2013', u'Argentina::20 June 2013', u'Australia::20 June 2013', u'Bosnia and Herzegovina::20 June 2013', u'Hong Kong::20 June 2013', u'Croatia::20 June 2013', u'South Korea::20 June 2013', u'Kuwait::20 June 2013', u'Lebanon::20 June 2013', u'Malaysia::20 June 2013', u'Portugal::20 June 2013', u'Serbia::20 June 2013', u'Singapore::20 June 2013', u'Slovenia::20 June 2013', u'Thailand::20 June 2013', u'Taiwan::20 June 2013', u'Bulgaria::21 June 2013', u'Canada::21 June 2013', u'UK::21 June 2013', u'Ireland::21 June 2013', u'India::21 June 2013', u'Lithuania::21 June 2013', u'Romania::21 June 2013', u'Turkey::21 June 2013', u'USA::21 June 2013', u'Vietnam::21 June 2013', u'Bolivia::27 June 2013', u'Switzerland::27 June 2013 (German speaking region)', u'Switzerland::27 June 2013 (Italian speaking region)', u'Chile::27 June 2013', u'Czech Republic::27 June 2013', u'Germany::27 June 2013', u'Dominican Republic::27 June 2013', u'Greece::27 June 2013', u'Hungary::27 June 2013', u'Italy::27 June 2013', u'Cambodia::27 June 2013', u'Kazakhstan::27 June 2013', u'Peru::27 June 2013', u'Russia::27 June 2013', u'Slovakia::27 June 2013', u'Ukraine::27 June 2013', u'Uruguay::27 June 2013', u'Austria::28 June 2013', u'Brazil::28 June 2013', u'Colombia::28 June 2013', u'Cyprus::28 June 2013', u'Ecuador::28 June 2013', u'Estonia::28 June 2013', u'Latvia::28 June 2013', u'Mexico::28 June 2013', u'Panama::28 June 2013', u'Pakistan::28 June 2013', u'Belgium::3 July 2013', u'Switzerland::3 July 2013 (French speaking region)', u'France::3 July 2013', u'Netherlands::4 July 2013', u'Poland::5 July 2013', u'Denmark::11 July 2013', u'Israel::11 July 2013', u'Iceland::12 July 2013', u'Norway::12 July 2013', u'Sweden::12 July 2013', u'Finland::19 July 2013', u'South Africa::19 July 2013', u'Spain::2 August 2013', u'Nigeria::9 August 2013', u'Japan::10 August 2013', u'Venezuela::23 August 2013']",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

At various points from the 1950s until his death a few years ago, King called Oakland Raiders, Golden State Warriors, A\'s and early on San Francisco Giants games. Current Oakland Raiders announcer Greg Papa was also the television play-by-play announcer for the Oakland A\'s from 1989 to 2003 and is the host of the San Francisco Giants pre and post games shows. Also heard are Ken Korach, then King\'s second fiddle who later took over the #1 play-by-play role, and color man Ray Fosse, a veteran of the 1970s Oakland championship teams who continued to call games for the A\'s through the 2013 season. Scott Hatteberg sometimes fills in for Ray Fosse as a color commentator.', u'Billy Beane refers to John Poloni as ""Rocco"". This is a reference to Jack McGee\'s father who played minor league baseball and whose nickname was ""Rocco"".', u'The film cast includes three Oscar winners: Brad Pitt, Spike Jonze and Philip Seymour Hoffman; and one Oscar nominee: Jonah Hill.', u'One of the most persistently negative faceless voices attacking Beane\'s approach to team building in the film is performed by noted character actor Ron Canada. The character who gives a sharp rebuke to the A\'s after the climactic playoff loss, was intended to evoke the views of baseball traditionalist like Hall of Famer Joe Morgan. In fact Canada auditioned as a Morgan voice match. Director Miller worked with Canada, a hard core fan of the game over three recording sessions to portray the broadcast scoldings from the game\'s conservatives. Some of that dialog is the result of mock interviews of Canada\'s ""character"" by Miller in the recording studio.Though not credited, Canada is proud to have contributed something to what he calls ""a sports film for grownups."".', u""Billy Beane is portrayed as a lonely divorc\xe9e in the film, though in real life, he had actually remarried.

He then earned the win when Scott Hatteberg hit a walk off homer in the bottom of the 9th. Koch saved 9 and earned the win in 3 games during the 20 game winning streak."", u""According to the book, the bat used by hatteburg in the walk off homer in was made by a company he did not have a deal with.

Emmanuel Lubezki laid down a series of parameters (a dogma) to be used throughout the film: Shoot in available natural light.Do not underexpose the negative. Keep true blacks.Preserve the latitude of the image.Seek maximum resolution and fine grain.Seek depth with deep focus and stop: ""Compose in depth.""Shoot in backlight for continuity and depth.Use negative fill to avoid light sandwiches (even sources on both sides)Shoot in crosslight only after dawn or before dusk; never front light.Avoid lens flares.Avoid white and primary colors in frame.Shoot with short focal length, hard lenses.No filters, except Polarizer.In the eye of the hurricane, shoot with steady handheld or Steadicam.Z-axis moves instead of pans and tilts.No zooming.Do some static tripod shots ""in midst of our haste""Accept the exception to the dogma (a.k.a Article E) - Article E however does not apply underexposure of the negative.', u'Dissatisfied by the look of modern computer generated visual effects, director Terrence Malick approached veteran special effects supervisor Douglas Trumbull, who was responsible for the visual effects in 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), to create the visual effects for the film using bygone optical and practical methods. This marks the first feature film Trumbull has provided the effects for in 29 years, his last being Blade Runner (1982).', u'The critic Jim Emerson got word of what Terrence Malick intended the sequence of dinosaurs to mean, by way of the visual effects supervisor in charge of that very sequence who is Michael L. Fink. Emerson describes what he learned from Fink; ""The premise of the four-shot scene was to depict the birth of consciousness (what some have called the ""birth of compassion"")-the first moment in which a living creature made a conscious decision to choose what Michael described as ""right from wrong, good from evil."" Or, perhaps, a form of altruism over predatory instinct"".', u'Emmanuel Lubezki explained Terrence Malick\'s approach to film by saying ""Photography is not used to illustrate dialogue or a performance"" but instead is used ""to capture emotion so that the movie is very experiential"".

Penn said ""I didn\'t at all find on the screen the emotion of the script, which is the most magnificent one that I\'ve ever read. A clearer and more conventional narrative would have helped the film without, in my opinion, lessening its beauty and its impact. Frankly, I\'m still trying to figure out what I\'m doing there and what I was supposed to add in that context.

Malick outlived both of his brothers: Lawrence R. Malick committed suicide in Europe at age 19 while studying to be a musician; and Chris Malick died in 2008 at age 60, several years after being severely burned in a car crash in Mexico that killed his wife (the telegram that Mrs. O'Brien receives indicates that R.L. died in a car crash).

One example of this can be found in the English subtitles of characters speaking in a foreign language. Occasionally, the foreign word is inserted into the subtitle.

Instead of the word ""Yes"" appearing in the subtitle, the word ""Oui"" appears, despite the fact that the rest of the French dialogue is translated to English.', u'At his audition in Berlin, Michael Fassbender inquired about playing Colonel Hans Landa.

He had already retired from acting, but agreed to play Winston Churchill in one scene."", u'At the movie premiere, Joseph Goebbels introduces Frederick Zoller to Emil Jannings (played by Hilmar Eichhorn), whom Goebbels calls ""the world\'s greatest actor."" Emil Jannings was a German-born star of silent movies. During the 1920s, he starred in several silent classics of German cinema directed by F.W. Murnau, including The Last Laugh (1922), and Faust (1926). In 1927, Jannings moved to Hollywood to star in American movies. In 1928, he became the very first winner of the Academy Award for Best Actor (and the first person to ever receive an Academy Award) for his work in The Way of All Flesh (1927), and The Last Command (1928). But his Hollywood career ended when talkies came in, as Jannings\' thick German accent made him difficult to understand. Jannings returned to Germany, where he co-starred with Marlene Dietrich in The Blue Angel (1930). During the Third Reich era, Jannings starred in numerous films intended to promote Nazism, including Der Herrscher (1937), Ohm Kr\xfcger (1941), and Bismarck\'s Dismissal (1942). Minister of Propoaganda Joseph Goebbels named Jannings as ""Artist of the State.""

For several months, Mayer gathered intelligence on the Germans\' ""Alpine Fortress,"" by posing as a Nazi officer and as a French electrician.

When the shot pans over to George Clooney, the number ""5150"" is displayed next to him. This corresponds to the health and safety code for placing a psychiatric hold on a deranged individual.

This is in homage to the producer Irwin Allen who is widely popular for his disaster movies and TV shows that depicted ways the world would end. His one technical contribution to the world of film and TV was his pioneering of the ""shaky-cam"" technique to imply aerial turbulence or an earthquake. His approach was to simply tilt the camera back and forth, and have his actors throw themselves across a set. This goes along with Rusty telling Bank there is a possibility of an earthquake, and their exit plan for the end of the movie to cause one to get all the people to leave with their winnings.', u'The characters make several references to a ""Susan B. Anthony"" in their heist. This is a reference to the Susan B. Anthony dollar manufactured by the US mint in 1979.

This method was used twice in the film, though the people are using an ordinary coin they don\'t realize that it will be worth millions in the slot: first by the woman in The Bank who wins the jackpot and later by the VUP at the slot machine in the airport.', u""All members of the Caldwell (Linus') family that we know of have impersonated some kind of law-enforcing agent in the three 'Ocean' movies.

The pop music of the pre-Beatles early sixties tended to be a bit on the clean-cut and cheerful side, but the inspiration for the soundtrack was clearly from the late sixties, which has more attitude and conveys a more aggressive feel. In one section it distinctly borrows from one highly popular hit of the latter part of the decade. As the Oceans crew takes the train during the flashback sequence, the music borrows directly from one late-sixties rock hit, including a nod to the main riff from Inna Gadda Da Vida at the beginning end of the action scene, and with the mayhem taking place over a nod to the jam section from the album version of that song.', u'Four cast members of Oceans Twelve also guest starred on Friends (1994-2004) including Brad Pitt, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, and Bruce Willis.', u'Fake name used by Danny Ocean (George Clooney) is M.

Shortly afterwards, Sam rejoins them, and then Lionel's mother arrives, which comes to a total of thirteen individuals who directly participated in the action aspects of the master plan.

Discoveries at the beginning of the 21st century provide new evidence of several armed battles in the right area at the right time, but definitive proof is hard to find, largely due to the historical practice of building one city on the ruins of another. Homer's Illiad (and similar epics depicting the Trojan War) were written hundreds of years after the Trojan War supposedly occurred, and are of little use in determining factual historical events because they include many mythological elements. One theory is that the Troy of Homer's lifetime was destroyed by an earthquake, and that the Illiad is a symbolic reinterpretation of that, since a horse is the symbol of the Greek god of earthquakes. The producers decided to eliminate all mythological elements from the story, giving the film an air of historical authenticity not present in the original works."", u'After the film was announced, the Turkish government and Ministry of Culture and Tourism contacted the producers and suggested the film be shot in Canakkale, Turkey, site of the real Troy.

According to 'The Iliad', Aeneas was the son of Venus, and the second greatest warrior the Trojans fielded during the war.

His son Orestes later avenged his death by killing them both."", u""There are several differences between Homer's Iliad and this movie. The twelve Greek Gods play a major role in the plot; some side with the Greeks and some with the Trojans, even arguing and physically fighting beside their allies. In the poem, neither Menelaus nor Agamemnon dies. Achilles' death is foretold, but does not occur in the Illiad, which leaves the Trojan War unresolved. He does die in the war in many related works by other authors. Ajax Telamon also survives the Iliad, but in related literature he dies by his own hand shortly after Achilles' death. The war lasts 10 years, and the events depicted in the movie take place during the last few months of the war. A Greek named Filoktitis or Philoctetes kills Paris right after he kills Achilles (not part of the Iliad, but part of the Greek mythology).

However, the movie departs from science in several ways: first, a real z-pinch is much too large to fit in the back of a van; second, a pinch can\'t create energy out of nowhere, and would need a power source much greater than Basher\'s ""score of car batteries"" or anything that would fit inside a van; third, even with such a power source, the electromagnetic pulse (EMP) generated by a real z-pinch is barely powerful enough to knock out an electronic device across a room. In fact, under current science, the only thing capable of generating a city-wide EMP is a genuine nuclear explosion.', u'At the end of the movie Danny Ocean (George Clooney) says to Rusty (Brad Pitt) ""$13 Million and you drive this piece of shit."" During the heist, Benedict (Andy Garcia) is handed a piece of paper that says the vault is holding $163,156,759. In the first meeting of all eleven, Ocean says that they will each get an equal share. Doing simple math, that means Reuben (Elliott Gould) put up about $20 Million in finance to pull off the job.', u'In the scene where the heist is kicked off with Saul/Lyman Zerga (Carl Reiner) going out in front to take delivery from his couriers, when the handcuff is exchanged to Lyman, there is banter in Russian. One of the phrases that is clearly audible is, ""Ya vas lyublyu."" Early in the movie The Great Escape (1963), Danny (Charles Bronson) and Sedgwick (James Coburn) try to sneak out with the Russian labor force and Sedgwick asks Danny if he knows any Russian.

This joke is carried over to this movie when Alex and Susi do the same thing with the line, ""Yeah, Dad, you told us.""', u'To keep things in order during production, director Guy Ritchie introduced a system of fines on set.

The car was in production from 1976-1986 and in this time there was a ""facelift"" updated model as used in this film. The car is driven by the rear wheels and was a favorite amongst police and criminals when they were in production; so much so in fact, that the police started buying second hand cars and converting them for use in the police force when they went out of production. There were many different engines available, such as a 2.3 and 2.6 liter in-line 6 cylinder engine and a 2.4 liter turbo diesel engine, which was revolutionary in the 1980s.

It is said to the dog because it\'s the dog who eats the diamond.', u'When Mickey ""wins"" a new trailer van for his mother from Turkish, he specifically picks out ""periwinkle blue"" as the color.

Norton eventually accepted the role in Fight Club. He and Jim Carrey did so well in auditions for the Andy Kaufman role in Man on the Moon that director Milos Forman told Universal he could not choose between them and the studio would have to make the final choice; they chose Carrey because he was a bigger box-office draw than Norton. Matt Damon took the lead role in The Talented Mr. Ripley, and Runaway Jury was put on hold for years until being revived with John Cusack as the lead."", u""The scene involving the destruction of the corporate artwork (where the huge ball crashes into the coffee shop) was the most troublesome scene to shoot in the whole film. Initially, director David Fincher had wanted to the scene to feature an entirely CG ball on live plates, but visual effects supervisor Kevin Tod Haug convinced him to try shooting it as a live special effect instead. As such, special effects coordinator Cliff Wenger was placed in charge of the scene. Problems began to arise when Wenger discovered that the flooring at the location could only take 250 pounds per square foot. As such, a lightweight ball (100 pounds) had to be built to ensure no damage was caused. However, because the ball was so light, it didn't react the way a heavy ball would; for example, when the ball rolls down the steps, it bounced, when it rolled through the water it left no wake, and when it rolls through the pool, rather than sinking and rolling along the surface, it floated. As well as that, the ball couldn't gather enough speed. In the end, Wenger was reduced to having two special effects people running alongside, pulling the ball on wires and trying to hold it down so it didn't float on the surface of the water. There were also problems shooting the scene where the ball crashes through the front of the coffee shop. Wenger had only a 40 foot run up to the front of the shop, but because the ball was 8 feet high, and the ceiling of the area in which they were shooting was 10 feet, it meant the ramp could only rise 2 feet off the ground, leaving virtually no room for the ball to gather momentum prior to smashing into the glass. As such, when the ball would hit the caf\xe9, it would smash the glass in the front of the shop and then just roll back out instead of crashing on into the counter. In the end, digital effects company Toybox was given the entire scene with orders to do a major cleanup on the live footage. For the rolling shots, they removed the bounces, added furniture which the ball violently knocks out of its way, added pavement cracks in the wake of the ball, added flickering lights, added additional splashes and a wake as the ball moves through the water, and added a digital camera shake. For the caf\xe9 shots, they completed the destruction of the counter, added flying glass and furniture, added flickering lights, and again, added digital vibration to the camera. In the end, although the majority of the actual scene is live photography, almost all of the minor effects in the shots are completely digital."", u""In the scene where Tyler and the Narrator go to the liposuction clinic to collect fat for their soap, they hide behind a dumpster with a sign that reads 'Infectious Human Waste'.

The car has a CRS sticker on the windshield (although the sticker cannot be seen in the actual film - David Fincher mentions it on his DVD commentary).', u'When the film stock was processed, several techniques were applied to alter the look of the footage and increase the \'grubbiness\' of the image. Under the supervision of director David Fincher and director of photography Jeff Cronenweth, the contrast was stretched, the print was underexposed, re-silvering was used to increase density, and high-contrast print stocks were stepped on the print to create a layer of \'dirt\', which Fincher likens to a ""dirty patina.""', u'The typeface used for the titles and logo is named ""Fight This"".', u'The Narrator and Marla are both in attendance at a Sickle-Cell Disease support group.

This was primarily because many scenes were to be shot on practical locations using practical lighting, which wouldn't provide enough luminosity for an anamorphic lens to capture the image (anamorphic lenses require more light than spherical lenses for correct exposure). The disadvantage of shooting with spherical lenses is that the negative has to be blown up for the extraction process (unlike an anamorphic negative), meaning that the final print has a grainier texture than that shot using anamorphic. However, both Fincher and Cronenweth felt that this extra grain actually suited the tone of the film, and no attempts were made to clean it up or reduce it in the post-production process."", u""Three directors were offered the film prior to David Fincher. Peter Jackson was the initial choice of producers Joshua Donen and Ross Grayson Bell, who had been impressed with Jackson's work on Taivaalliset olennot (1994) and Kummituskopla (1996). Jackson however, although he loved the Chuck Palahniuk novel, was too busy prepping The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001) in New Zealand. The second choice for director was Bryan Singer, who was sent the book, but who never got back to the producers (he later admitted he didn't read the novel when he received it). Next to be offered the job was British director Danny Boyle, who met with Donen and Bell, read the book, and loved the material, but who ultimately decided to concentrate on The Beach (2000) instead. The producers then turned to David Fincher, who was in post-production on The Game (1997).

However, Fincher was reluctant to work with 20th Century Fox again after his negative experiences making Alien 3 (1992), so a meeting was set up between Donen, Bell, Fincher, President of Production at Fox 2000 Pictures Laura Ziskin and 20th Century Fox studio head Bill Mechanic, where Fincher's relationship with the studio was restored, and he was hired to direct the film."", u'The film cast includes three Oscar winners: Brad Pitt, Jared Leto and Kevin Scott Mack (cameo role); and two Oscar nominees: Edward Norton and Helena Bonham Carter.', u'In Tyler Durden\'s house there is a Movieline magazine cover featuring Drew Barrymore, a close friend of Edward Norton.

She felt it was a tremendous piece of literature, but not necessarily a great movie. The book was sent to a 20th Century Fox studio reader to evaluate its potential as a possible film, and the report sent back to Ziskin slammed the novel, saying it could never be made into a film, that it was ""exceedingly disturbing"", ""volatile and dangerous"", and would ""make audiences squirm"". Despite this however, Ziskin decided to go ahead with the project temporarily and began to look around for producers who might be willing to take it on. It was first offered to Lawrence Bender and Art Linson, but they turned it down (although Linson would ultimately return as producer). Next, it was offered to Joshua Donen and Ross Grayson Bell of Atman Entertainment. They both loved it and immediately agreed to produce it. Bell has since stated that the highly critical report from the studio reader was all he needed to make him want to work on the film, feeling every reason that the reader gave for why the film couldn\'t be made, was another reason to make it. Donen and Bell immediately organized a read-through of the book with some actors, who performed a roughly scripted version of the novel over the course of a six-hour session, and he sent recordings of the session to the still wavering Ziskin.

history.', u""They're Coming.""]","[u'Bruce Willis took a lower salary than his star-status would normally entitle, partly because of budget restrictions, but mostly because he wanted to work with Terry Gilliam. Actually Bruce did the movie for free. It was only after the movie was released that he was paid.', u""Terry Gilliam was afraid that Brad Pitt wouldn't be able to pull off the nervous, rapid speech. He sent him to a speech coach but in the end he just took away Pitt's cigarettes, and Pitt played the part exactly as Gilliam wanted."", u'Terry Gilliam gave Bruce Willis a list of ""Willis acting clich\xe9s"" not to be used during the film, including the ""steely blue eyes look"".', u'When Cole is drawing blood from himself, the shadow of a hamster in a hamster wheel can be seen on the wall. This scene would normally be shot in 5 minutes, but took a whole day because the hamster would not move, and Terry Gilliam is such a perfectionist, that he insisted that even this detail should work as intended. For the rest of the production, Gilliam\'s perfectionism was nicknamed ""The Hamster Factor"".', u'Although never addressed directly in the film, the script and some promotional material reveal that the future scenes take place in the year 2035.', u'Toward the end of the film, Cole and Railly are watching Vertigo (1958). The scene that is shown heavily influenced the film La Jet\xe9e (1962), which inspired Twelve Monkeys. There is also a version of that same scene shown in La Jet\xe9e (1962).', u'Terry Gilliam\'s first choice for the lead role was Jeff Bridges, whom he had enjoyed working with on The Fisher King (1991), but the studio wanted a bigger star, so he cast Bruce Willis. Ironically, Willis had originally auditioned for ""The Fisher King"", but lost out to Bridges.', u'Director Terry Gilliam first met Bruce Willis while casting his film The Fisher King (1991). He was impressed by the sensitivity shown by Willis in the scene from Die Hard (1988) where McClane (Willis) talks about his wife while pulling glass from his feet. Talking to Willis, Gilliam discovered that this part was ad-libbed by Willis. Gilliam remembered this, and was convinced to cast him in this film.', u'A tagline originally suggested for this film was: ""The future is in the hands of a man who has none."" This was considered to be a confusing tagline, as it made it sound as though he had no hands, as opposed to having no future.', u'Most of the actors took a pay cut just so they could get the chance to work with Terry Gilliam.', u'Brad Pitt was signed to this movie for a relatively small salary, when he was still an ""up and coming"" actor. By the time of the movie\'s release, however, Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles (1994), Legends of the Fall (1994), and Se7en (1995) had been released, making Pitt a top-salary actor.', u'Brad Pitt received his first Golden Globe for his performance as Jeffrey Goines.', u'Throughout the movie, actual monkeys appear on camera, from the ""monkey and a roast beef sandwich"" to zoo animals. Some people suggest 12 different monkeys appear in the film.', u'Artist Lebbeus Woods claimed that the interrogation chair in the movie closely resembled his 1987 illustration ""Neomechanical Tower (Upper) Chamber"" and managed to get a court to stop the movie 28 days after its release. He eventually settled with Universal for a six-figure sum.', u'The scenes in the insane asylum were shot in Eastern State Penitentiary, a now-unused prison in Philadelphia.', u""The final cut didn't do too well in the test screenings and so those involved discussed making major changes to the movie, but Terry Gilliam eventually decided to keep it as it was. When released, it went on to make over five times its budget."", u'Terry Gilliam was impressed by the film\'s screenplay because it touched on some of the themes he\'d covered in his previous film Brazil (1985). He was shocked to find out that Universal was interested in making the film, partly because it was the kind of movie that he didn\'t think major studios would support and partly because he and Universal had clashed violently over ""Brazil"" a decade earlier. When he learned then-Universal chief Casey Silver was a strong backer of the new project, and that none of the figures who he\'d clashed with over ""Brazil"" were going to block him or torpedo it, he signed up to direct.', u'The Army of the Twelve Monkeys is inspired by a passage in L. Frank Baum\'s novel, ""The Magic of Oz"", in which the Nome King and Kiki Aru convince twelve monkeys they will have an endless supply of food if they become human soldiers for them.', u""Right after Dr. Leland Goines gets off the phone with Dr. Railly, Dr. Peters can be seen handling a tray of seven vials filled with a golden liquid. Twice in the movie, a passage of The Book of the Revelation is quoted referring to seven golden vials filled with God's wrath."", u""The two newscasters shown in the film were actual newscasters on Philadelphia's Channel 10 news at the time of filming."", u'When James is escaping from the asylum, he runs past a security guard who is reading a tabloid, its cover is the now famous photo of the fictional ""batboy"" that was supposedly found in a cave in the 1990s. The story, about a society outcast ahead of his time, was made into an off-Broadway hit musical.', u'The ""TV Ball"" prop was notoriously problematic, with either the electronics or hydraulics breaking almost every time it was used.', u'In the 24-hour Hitchcock Theater, Kathryn and James are watching Vertigo (1958). She transforms herself with a blonde wig and James sees her emerge within a red light. This mirrors a scene from that movie. The same Bernard Herrmann score can be heard, and Kathryn wears the same coat that Kim Novak wears in the first part of Vertigo.', u'When Kathryn Railly first gets a call about Cole, she is attending a poetry recital. The work being read is a quatrain from ""The Rubaiyat"" by Persian-born poet and astronomer Omar Khayyam. The quatrain being read is: Yesterday This Day\'s Madness did prepare; To-morrow\'s Silence, Triumph, or Despair: Drink! for you know not whence you came, nor why: Drink! for you know not why you go, nor where.', u""Terry Gilliam admitted he was disappointed with Joseph Melito. He felt he wasn't the right child actor to play Young Cole, and even had a backup on standby if his scenes didn't come off like they should."", u'A quick clip from The Andromeda Strain (1971), featuring a monkey in the throes of death, is seen on the day-room television during a news report about the cruelty of using animal subjects in medical research.', u'The title and logo design are inspired by the ""Get off the Earth"" puzzle created by Sam Loyd in 1898. It consists of 13 characters on two dials, that when twisted, one of them disappears.', u'Johnny Depp was considered for the role of Jeffrey Goines.', u""Some scenes were filmed at Eastern State Penitentiary in Philadelphia. By some accounts, it was the world's first penitentiary, and it was built in 1829 in an effort to begin treating prisoners more humanely. Despite official good intentions, prisoners were forced to wear hoods whenever they were outside of their cells and all forms of human interactions were forbidden. Silence was absolutely enforced throughout the facility and prisoners were kept completely isolated from the outside world and each other, so naturally many of them came in as delinquents and came out insane (if they came out at all). Unsurprisingly, there are now claims that and even in the 20th century, when the prison became overcrowded and the silence rules were dropped, prisoners couldn't wait to get out of that creepy place."", u""Although this was inspired by Chris Marker's classic short, La Jet\xe9e (1962), director Terry Gilliam had not seen it when this was made."", u'In the asylum, when Bruce Willis is sitting at the little table talking to Jeffrey, he is writing with his left hand. Bruce is pretty strict about being a lefty with his directors, even golfing left-handed in Armageddon.', u'The film takes place in 1914-1918, 1990, 1996 and 2035.', u'Terry Gilliam had a nearly fatal horse riding accident during production. He was worried the accident might upset his creative vision.', u'In the 24-hour Hitchcock Theater, Kathryn transforms herself with a blonde wig. Alfred Hitchcock had a notorious obsession with blonde actresses in his films.', u'In the movie, there is an escape attempt but it ends rather quickly. In real life, Eastern State Penitentiary saw dozens of successful escapes. The biggest one was in 1945 when a dozen inmates successfully dug a tunnel from the prison to the outside. The mastermind was bank robber ""Slick Willie"" Sutton and he was caught just two blocks away. Most of the others were recaptured and/or shot and one of them, James Grace, voluntarily surrendered himself a week later. He hadn\'t been able to feed himself since his escape and wanted to know if his cell was still vacant.', u'The first of three movies in which Bruce Willis travels back in time to meet a younger version of himself. The next two were The Kid (2000) and Looper (2012).', u'The voice of a reporter on the radio says, ""This is Roger Pratt reporting."" Roger Pratt was the film\'s director of photography.', u""The actual slides during Kathryn Railly's speech were added in post-production. Actors and extras were asked by Terry Gilliam to look at a blank projection screen."", u'When Cole wakes up in the future to the doctors singing ""Blueberry Hill,"" the painting above him is ""Valley of the Yosemite"", by Albert Bierstadt.', u""Director Terry Gilliam tried to persuade the studio to cast Nick Nolte as James Cole and Jeff Bridges as Jeffrey Goines, but was not successful as neither had any big hits since Another 48 Hrs. (1990) and The Fabulous Baker Boys (1989). Nolte and Bridges are in fact close friends, and have tried and failed to team up several times. Cutter's Way (1981) and Tequila Sunrise (1988) were both meant to star the pair. They finally worked together in Simpatico (1999)."", u'At one point, Cole says ""All I see is dead people."" Bruce Willis later starred in The Sixth Sense (1999), in which a character named Cole says, ""I see dead people.""', u'A statue named ""The Kiss"", by the French sculptor Auguste Rodin can be seen briefly in the movie. A picture of the same statue was used by director Terry Gilliam in an animation he made for the show Monty Python\'s Flying Circus (1969).', u""The Walters Art Museum in Baltimore, Maryland was used as the setting for the lecture during which Dr. Railly is introduced. The film opens on a closeup of The Ideal City, one of the Walters' most iconic paintings and one which Terry Gilliam really liked for the film."", u""In the future scene where Cole is in a hospital with a picture on the ceiling, the blankets on his bed feature a scene from the children's book Fourteen Bears In Summer And Winter by Evelyn Scott written in 1963."", u'Inspired by La Jet\xe9e (1962)', u'Features a fresnel (flat) lens, as did Brazil (1985), also directed by Terry Gilliam.', u'When Cole and the doctor are in the movie theater they are watching Vertigo (1958). When Cole wakes up, The Birds (1963) is playing. As Cole leaves the theater, the marquee says Hitchcock Marathon and lists all the movies, but does not include The Birds (1963).', u'In the 24 hour Alfred Hitchcock theater, James Cole Madeleine Stowe\'s character watches a scene from Vertigo (1958) which features James Stewart and a character named ""Madeleine"".', u""The montage of animals roaming loose in Philadelphia contains a shot of elephants running along the concourse of Franklin Field, the same location of several scenes from Unbreakable (2000) where Bruce Willis's character works as a security guard."", u""Terry Gilliam: [bookends] begins and ends with young Cole's eyes."", u""It was Terry Gilliam's intention to make the film's plot ambiguous and that there are many theories that suggest Cole is simply mad and that none of the events in the future actually happen."", u'There are many parallels between the future world and the present day asylum where Cole is locked: The obvious is that Cole is incarcerated in both times; in the future he is trapped in an underground jail and in the present he is locked in a mental clinic.In the future scenes there are 5 scientists behind a table trying to decide if Cole is the proper man for the mission. In the present day there are also 5 scientists behind a table to figure out if Cole is sane or not (essentially the scientists in the asylum are six if it takes into account Dr Kathryn Railly who is present during the interview. In the final future scenes there is a sixth scientist appearing who, according to the credits, is a mechanic).Right before he time travels, Cole is decontaminated in the showers. After he is apprehended in 1990 and taken into custody he is also forced to shower. In both circumstances he is supervised by two guards, one black and one white (in the future the white guard is thin and the black guard is obese whereas in the present it is vice versa). In 1990 Cole tries to escape from the asylum. As he is roaming in the corridors in a drugged and dizzy state of mind he accidentally enters a room where a cat scanning is conducted. The cat scanner is strongly reminiscent of the time traveling device in the future.', u'Director Terry Gilliam and producer Charles Roven had several arguments about how the film should end. Gilliam wanted to finish on the shot of Railly looking at young Cole while Roven preferred the scripted final scene in the parking lot outside the airport. In an attempt to dissuade Roven, Gilliam proposed an immensely complex setup involving two cranes on top of one another and a vast sea of cars in the hope that Roven would veto it as being too expensive. Roven not only okayed the shot but Gilliam so loved the result that he used it to end the film.', u'According to a newspaper that is vaguely visible in the final airport scene, the date during which the events of the finale take place (and therefore the date of the virus outbreak) is Friday, December 13, 1996.', u'For the first time in his career, Terry Gilliam had ""final cut"" on the finished film. It was all the more surprising to him after the notorious tug of war he had with Universal over Brazil (1985). ""Twelve Monkeys"" has a similarly fatalistic ending, but Universal didn\'t interfere this time.', u'The airport scene at the end of the movie, was filmed at the Philadelphia Convention Center. However, the exterior shot of Cole and Dr. Railly walking into the airport, was filmed at BWI Airport in Baltimore, Maryland.', u'The revolver that Cole is handed at the end is a Cavalry Model Le Mat, as used by the Confederacy during the American Civil War.', u""In Twelve Monkeys, Bruce Willis's character, James Cole, says, 'all I see are dead people', which echoes the words said by Haley Joel Osment's character Cole Sear: 'I see dead people' in The Sixth Sense (1999). Both movies are set in Philadelphia."", u'The picture that proves that James Cole was in the First World War also depicts Jose, his friend from the future who gives him the gun in the final airport scenes.', u'Pennsylvania requires only a rear license plate, the shot of the car at the Goines party, where James Cole is underneath, has a front license plate.

Sloth - also known as laziness; disinclined to activity or exertion: not energetic or vigorous: ""The way of the sluggard is blocked with thorns, but the path of the upright is a highway"" (Proverbs 15:19).

But when New Line sent David Fincher the screenplay to review for his interest in the project, they accidentally sent him the original screenplay with the head-in-the-box ending. When New Line realized that they had sent Fincher the wrong draft, the President of Production, Michael De Luca, met with Fincher and noted that there was internal pressure to retain the revised version; De Luca stated that if Fincher promised to produce the movie, they would be able to stay with the head-in-a-box ending. Despite this, Producer Kopelson refused to allow the film to include the head-in-a-box scene.

Ingels is best known for his work of ""The Old Witch"" from The Haunt of Fear, the sister title of Tales From the Crypt published by EC. After horror comics were vilified and ceased to be published in the mid 1950s, Ingels relocated to Florida, and became a recluse.

Rather than filming separate reaction shots, Ridley Scott rigged the tanker to blow up during the take, in order to get authentic expressions of surprise from the two leads. Despite this, they were so astonished while watching it, that they forgot to actually react, so Scott had to film their reactions again.', u""Ridley Scott is very receptive to ideas from cast and crew members on his films, and used many suggestions from Susan Sarandon during production. Some ideas of Sarandon's that made the final cut of the film: the visual of Louise packing her shoes in plastic bags while prepping for the lady's weekend getaway in the mountains; the scene where Louise exchanges her jewelry for the old man's hat; and the scene where Louise stops the car in the desert at night and takes a personal moment looking at the stars, while Thelma sleeps in the car. That last scene idea took half the night to light. Sarandon and her longtime partner Tim Robbins re-worked most of the dialogue in the sequence between Louise and her boyfriend Jimmy at the hotel in Oklahoma City. Originally that scene called for Louise and Jimmy to make love and conduct an impromptu mock wedding ceremony. Sarandon felt that having sex would be the last thing Louise would be interested in doing at that point in the story, and told Scott that if she performed the sequence as written, that they would have to include a scene where Louise would wig out as a result, and prior to signing on to do the film, Scott gave Sarandon his word that he would not change the ending of the movie.

However, in addition to late \'80s hairstyles and clothing, hanging in the bedroom of the Blocker twins is a poster for Madonna\'s ""True Blue"" album, which was released in 1986, two years after the release of A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984), which can be dated to 1984 by Nancy\'s viewing of The Evil Dead (1981), and a poster on her wall of the band The Police.

This is a reference to season one, episode two, ""It\'s a Miserable Life"", in which the employee (who is the owner\'s son) is shot at the drive-thru during his nightmare.', u'A director of an episode from this show had his daughter Robin be called out on the show for her birthday, which made her a star at her school for a week.', u'Robbie Harper wrote the pilot.', u""In one episode, Director William Malone had his daughter Robin's name and birthday called out on the air."", u'Season two, episode ten, ""Do You Know Where Your Kids Are?"", near the end, when Patti is closing the double doors, a cameraman\'s shadow is visible on the wall when the shot pulls back. Edit Share+ Judging by Patti\'s toys in season two, episode eight, ""Bloodlines"", one would assume that the episode takes place in the \'80s, but posters of Jon Bon Jovi are prominently featured in this episode, leading to some reasonable doubt about the timeline (since this is supposed to be more than a decade later).', u'Season one, episode one, ""No More Mr. Nice Guy"". There\'s more than a few inconsistencies between this episode and the established story from the films. In A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984), it was stated that Freddy was released because ""somebody forgot to sign the search warrant in the right place."" Here he was released, because the arresting officer didn\'t read him his Miranda rights. Lieutenant Blocker is never mentioned in the films, and the Thompsons from the first movie, who were part of the mob, aren\'t mentioned here. Marge Thompson said of Krueger\'s death that the parents left a trail of gasoline through the boiler room and out the door, lit a match and watched it burn. Here, however, Lieutenant Blocker douses Krueger himself with gas and lights the match. In Freddy\'s Dead: The Final Nightmare (1991), the mob is seen throwing a Molotov cocktail into Krueger\'s lair, which is also inconsistent with his death here. In that film, he\'s merely surrounded by flames when the dream demons arrive to offer him immortality, he\'s not actually on fire. In the first film, Marge Thompson revealed that she took Freddy\'s glove as a souvenir after they murdered him. No reference is made to anyone doing this here. In this episode, it\'s officer Gene Stratton who hides Krueger\'s remains, but in A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors (1987), Donald Thompson was revealed to be the only one who knew where Krueger\'s corpse was hidden. There\'s been some speculation as to whether or not Stratton was supposed to be Thompson, but Stratton wasn\'t present when Krueger was murdered, as Thompson was alluded to have been. Additionally, the time period, in which No More Mr. Nice Guy takes place, throws the rest of the Elm Street timeline completely askew. In A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984), Nancy watched The Evil Dead (1981) on her television, and has a poster of the band The Police on her wall, which establishes the film taking place in 1983 or 1984. Since Nancy and her friends were unaware of Freddy (and a deleted scene reveals the kids who were being terrorized in the first film each had siblings who were murdered by Krueger), Freddy\'s death would have been in the late \'60s or early \'70s. No More Mr. Nice Guy is supposed to be a prequel to the first film, however, the look is very late \'80s and (in addition to the vehicles) Lieutenant Blocker winds up wearing a Walkman style of headphones that weren\'t around in the \'60s and \'70s. The timeline is thrown into further disarray by the sequel to this episode, Sister\'s Keeper, where a poster for Madonna\'s ""True Blue"" adorns the wall of the Blocker girls\' bedroom.
