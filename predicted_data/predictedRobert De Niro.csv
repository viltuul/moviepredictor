met with Purvis's son, Alston, and several close friends of the real Melvin Purvis, in order to learn his attitudes, mannerisms, and speech patterns. By the same token, Johnny Depp went to the John Dillinger Museum in Indiana, and was allowed to read some of his letters. According to Depp in the DVD documentary, he even tried on the pants Dillinger wore the night he was shot. With a laugh, Depp says the pants fit him perfectly."", u'In the commentary, Michael Mann reports that a crew member pointed out that the date was April 22nd. Mann then realized that they were filming on the anniversary of the actual shoot-out of the Little Bohemia lodge.', u'During a getaway scene following a bank robbery, Johnny Depp drives a 1932 Studebaker, that was used by Dillinger as a getaway car, following a bank robbery in Greencastle, Indiana. The car was borrowed from a nearby auto museum, during filming in Columbus, Ohio.', u'While filming on location in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, a boy, aged eleven, told Johnny Depp he loved his Fedora hat, and would like to have one like it. Depp told the boy he would see what he could do about that. After filming finished, Depp sent the boy the hat in the mail.', u""For John Dillinger's famous escape from Crown Point Jail, the film makers decided to film at the real jail, which had been closed and turned into a set of small shops, and became a historical site. They dressed the jail and store fronts on the square to it's original condition, as it would've appeared in 1934. They also filmed the Little Bohemia shoot-out at the real lodge. Johnny Depp was staying in the same room the real Dillinger stayed in."", u'In a Senate hearing scene, when asked how many people he has arrested personally, J. Edgar Hoover (Billy Crudup) sheepishly admits, ""I have never arrested anybody."" In real-life, this was a point of embarrassment to Hoover, and he decided to correct it. On May 1, 1936, FBI Agents tracked down Alvin Carpis (played by Giovanni Ribisi in the film) in New Orleans, Louisiana. Hoover flew to New Orleans, and personally arrested Karpis as he sat in his car outside of his hide-out. News reports of the arrest made Hoover a national hero, and solidified his image as a powerful law enforcement officer. However, Karpis later claimed that Hoover\'s involvement in his arrest was not quite so heroic. Supposedly, Hoover waited in a nearby FBI car while Federal Agents surrounded Karpis at gunpoint. Then Hoover walked over to Karpis and told him he was under arrest. When Hoover told the FBI Agents, ""Put the cuffs on him, boys"" the FBI men realized they hadn\'t brought any handcuffs, and Karpis\' hands had to be secured using an Agent\'s necktie.', u'In the movie, John Dillinger and other bank robbers are seen having friendly relations with the Chicago mobsters. Specifically with Phillip D\'Andrea, a top Lieutenant in the Al Capone mob. In real-life, Al Capone was said to admire bank robbers, and would often allow bandits safe haven in Chicago, under the mob\'s protection. However, as also shown in the movie, after Frank Nitti took over the mob, following Al Capone\'s conviction for tax evasion, he cut off such resources to outlaws like Dillinger, Baby Face Nelson, and Alvin Carpis, because of the ""heat"" that was being brought down on the mobs, because of the FBI\'s furious hunt for these men.', u'Although Billie Frechette was never given a ""third degree"" interrogation by the FBI, as shown in the movie, the FBI Agents did, in fact, perform similar tactics on Helen Nelson (the wife of Baby Face Nelson), Alvin Carpis, and a John Dillinger associate in Chicago, named James Probasco. In the instance of Probasco, he ended up falling to his death from a upper-floor window. Offically, it is believed he committed suicide in order to avoid further interrogation. However, some historians believe that the FBI Agents interrogating Probasco attempted to make him talk, by hanging him out of a window, and that the Agents lost their grip on him.', u'The melodramatic dialogue between John Dillinger\'s lawyer Louis Piquett (pronounced ""Pickett""), Prosecutor Robert Estill, and Sheriff Lilian Holley, concerning the removal of Dillinger\'s shackles, and Piquett\'s request to keep Dillinger at Crown Point are virtually word for word the interaction between them in the court records. This includes Sheriff Holley\'s affirmation (which later proved to be a regretful statement) that Crown Point was ""The safest jail in Indiana.""', u""It's true that John Dillinger enjoyed taking photographs of police officers when the opportunity presented itself, and even late in his career, he would often attend Cubs games, and frequent bars in Chicago, but he probably didn't enter the offices of the Dillinger Squad, as depicted in the film. Dillinger also tended to brag about his exploits. As with many other events in his life, he would have surely related such a fantastic thing to his family, his lawyer, or his lawyer's investigator, Art O'Leary, a man Dillinger often confided in. However, according to Bryan Burrough's book, he did enter the same building as the Chicago Police Department on a few occasions, and he did accompany Polly Hamilton into the building to get her waitress' license."", u""Billie Frechette (real name Mary Evelyn Frechette) was actually married to Welton Spark, at the time of her relationship with John Dillinger. She married Spark in July 1932. He was convicted shortly thereafter for mail theft, and received a fifteen-year term in Leavenworth, with a transfer to Alcatraz in September 1934. Her divorce from Spark wasn't finalized until the early '40s. She later married a man named Wally Wilson, the name she took to the grave. Wilson died unexpectedly, cause unknown, date unknown. Billie married Art Tic in 1965, a state Game Warden, and barber from Shawano, Wisconsin. She died January 13, 1969, of mouth cancer. Mysteriously, her grave marker lists her name as Evelyn Tic (apparently against her wishes) and has the incorrect date of death as 1970."", u'John Dillinger\'s lawyer at Crown Point, Louis Piquett (pronounced ""pick it""), never went to law school. He passed the bar on his fourth attempt, receiving his license to practice in 1920.', u'After his embarrassment before the Senate Appropriations Comitte, J. Edgar Hoover is telling his assistant to release a press statement through Walter Winchell to discredit the Senator who humiliated Hoover. Walter Winchell was famous radio show host, and New York City news columnist, who was friends with Hoover. Winchell also hung around with famous New York City gangsters like Lucky Luciano, Meyer Lansky, and Frank Costello.', u'Dillinger\'s line to a bank customer during a robbery - ""We\'re here for the bank\'s money, not yours."" - echoes a similar exchange between Clyde Barrow (Warren Beatty) and a farmer during a bank robbery in Arthur Penn\'s classic, Bonnie and Clyde (1967). (""Is that your money or the bank\'s?"" ""It\'s mine."" You keep it then."") There is some dispute over which real-life bank robber spoke this line. Supposedly, John Dillinger said it to a bank customer while robbing a bank in Greencastle, Indiana. However, some crime historians attribute the line to Charles Arthur ""Pretty Boy"" Floyd. Most crime historians agree that the psychotic Clyde Barrow never used the line. This scene also shares familiarity with the bank scene in Michael Mann\'s Heat (1995), where Robert De Niro\'s character states: ""We\'re here for the bank\'s money, not yours.""', u'John Dillinger was actually left-handed. The gun held by Johnny Depp is backwards.', u'While at the horse track in Florida, Frank Nitti asks Phillip D\'Andrea whether or not it\'s hot outside, saying ""Ever since those pricks shot me, I can\'t stay warm."" This is an allusion to a failed attempt on Nitti\'s life by a corrupt cop named Harry Lang, who tried and failed to murder Nitti during a police raid.', u'Leonardo DiCaprio was initially attached to star in a leading role when this project was put into development in 2004.', u'John Hamilton was actually mortally wounded in a gun battle with police near Hastings, Minnesota, a few hours after leaving Little Bohemia. Hamilton died three or four days later, depending on the source, at the apartment of Barker-Karpis gang member Volney Davis in Aurora, Illinois. John Dillinger and Van Meter, along with members of the Barker-Karpis gang, buried Hamilton in a gravel pit in Oswego, Illinois. In an attempt to prevent identification of the body, ten cans of lye were poured on the corpse, and the right hand was cut off. Agents recovered the body on August 28, 1935. The Bureau was able to identify Hamilton by his teeth. Hamilton\'s teeth were later exhibited at the 1939 midwinter meeting of the Chicago Dental Society. Where Hamilton\'s choppers are presently located, is unknown. A gruesome FBI photo of the recovered body can be seen in the photo section of Dary Matera\'s ""The Life and Death of America\'s First Celebrity Criminal.""', u'While three months separated both John Dillinger and Melvin Purvis, Johnny Depp is almost eleven years older than Christian Bale.', u'This is the third time Johnny Depp and James Russo work together on a film.

Depp was preparing to film Shantaram with Mira Nair while Cotillard was rehearsing for Rob Marshall's musical, Nine (2009)."", u'Dillinger is shown serenading his hostages while driving away from the prison escape by singing ""The Last Round-Up"". ""The Last Round-Up"" was published in 1933. It became songwriter Billy Hill\'s biggest hit. It wasn\'t long before the song became Number 1, and stayed there for nine weeks. According to Lee Hill Taylor, while her father was working on a ranch in Montana, he asked one of the cowboys why they continued to ride in a round-up when they got older. The cowboy told him there was a time when they had to stop, and that would be their ""last round-up."" Right after their brief conversation this cowboy was riding his horse and was accidentally knocked off and trampled to death. Hill never forgot that terrible accident, and used it as the basis for his memorable song.', u'There is a scene where J. Edgar Hoover is giving out Junior G-Man badges to young men who may enter into law enforcement at some point. Al Pacino asks Tone Loc ""What do you want for that, a Junior G-Man badge?"" in Michael Mann\'s classic Heat (1995).', u""The poster and associated advertising was designed by Graphic Designer Neville Brody, who actually designed a new typeface for the title. Michael Mann is a fan of Brody's work."", u'In the DVD audio commentary for the film, Michael Mann praised Jason Clarke repeatedly, calling him one of the most talented actors he had ever encountered.', u'Former Ethiopian Emperor and Rastafari Messiah Haile Selassie appears in an uncredited role in a newsreel.', u'According to Carey Mulligan, a kissing sequence between her and Johnny Depp never made it into the release print (interview: The Graham Norton Show: Johnny Depp/Ricky Gervais/Carey Mulligan/Ed Byrne/Snow Patrol (2011)).', u'In the beginning of the movie, ""Pretty Boy"" Floyd (Channing Tatum) was shot by Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale), and died shortly thereafter. In actuality, Floyd was shot by a retired East Liverpool, Ohio cop. Then, according to the FBI, Purvis questioned him. Receiving only curses, Purvis ordered another Agent to shoot Floyd. Also the movie suggests, Floyd died before John Dillinger (Johnny Depp). Floyd was actually killed three months to the day, after Dillinger.', u""The felt hats used in the film's wardrobe, were specially manufactured by Feltros Portugueses.S.A. (FEPSA), a specialist company founded in 1969, but inheriting the know-how prevalent in its region (S\xe3o Jo\xe3o da Madeira, Portugal) since the mid eighteenth-century."", u'In the shoot-out at the Little Bohemian Lodge, the FBI are told where the gang was holed up, by basically torturing Tommy Carroll (Spencer Garrett). It also portrays ""Baby Face"" Nelson (Stephen Graham) and Homer Van Meter (Stephen Dorff) being killed at this site. Actually, Dillinger (Johnny Depp), Van Meter, Red Hamilton (Jason Clarke), Carroll, and Nelson all escaped unharmed.', u'Jason Clarke and Channing Tatum had significant roles in this film, and would go on to star together in White House Down (2013).', u'One of two 2009 films featuring Stephen Lang and Giovanni Ribisi, with the other film being Avatar (2009).', u'Marion Cotillard and Christian Bale appeared in The Dark Knight Rises (2012).', u'The film cast includes two Oscar winners: Marion Cotillard and Christian Bale; and two Oscar nominees: Carey Mulligan and Johnny Depp.', u'The three reporters peppering Dillinger with questions during a press conference in the Crown Point jail were actual working newspaper reporters from two major newspapers in Northwestern Indiana.', u'After ratting John Dillinger out to the Bureau, in exchange for assurances that she be allowed to stay in the U.S., Anna Sage (real name Ana Cumpanas) collected a five thousand dollar reward, and was duly deported back to Romania twenty-one months after the Biograph shooting.', u'Just before Dillinger goes to the movies the night he is killed, when John is washing and shaving, the camera pans across a table with his pocket watch, gun, glasses, and a money belt. According to Anna Sage (a.k.a. ""The Woman In Red""), John Dillinger was wearing a money belt with three thousand dollars inside. However, when Dillinger was killed, the money belt was nowhere to be found. Historians have speculated that Sergeant Martin Zarkovich, who was a part of Melvin Purvis\' posse at the theater, stole the money.', u""When John Dillinger's body was lying in the street outside the Biograph theater, many by-standers dipped handkerchiefs in his blood to keep as a souvenir."", u'The gunfight at the lodge in the woods was filmed at the Little Bohemia Lodge in Manitowish Waters, Wisconsin, which is the actual location where the gunfight between John Dillinger and the FBI took place in 1934. In fact, shell casings from the 1934 gunfight can still be found in the woods surrounding the lodge.', u'Due to the concern of grave robbers, officials at Crown Hill Cemetery persuaded John Dillinger\'s father to have his famous son\'s grave re-opened, so as to place staggered concrete slabs, along with poured concrete and chicken wire, in and around the grave as a permanent deterrent. He\'d already been offered ten thousand dollars from a Wisconsin carnival man to ""borrow"" Dillinger\'s body for his show, an offer that was fiercely rejected. The grave work was done within a day or two of the initial burial. The identity of who paid for this expensive preventative measure is unknown.', u'Most accounts have John Dillinger dying within a few moments of getting shot outside of the Biograph. According to Special Agent Robert Gillespie, who was right beside the outlaw after he fell, it was approximately three minutes before Dillinger took his last gasp of air.', u'When Melvin Purvis shoots down ""Pretty Boy"" Floyd, he asks Floyd for info on the whereabouts of Harry Campbell. In reality, Floyd was never associated with Campbell, who robbed banks with Alvin Carpis and ""Ma"" Barker\'s sons. The reason for this question, may have been to simplify the narrative of the story. In real-life, ""Pretty Boy"" Floyd was wanted by the FBI for his alleged part in the ""Kansas City Massacre"" on June 17, 1933, in which an FBI Agent, two Kansas policemen, a retired Oklahoma Sheriff, and their captive Frank ""Jelly"" Nash, were ambushed and killed. This was the crime that set into motion the rise of J. Edgar Hoover and the FBI, and the start of the ""War On Crime"". Since this fact would (or could) possibly make the story on film more convoluted, the film makers instead have Purvis question Floyd about Campbell, rather than the massacre, as he did in real-life.', u'The portrayal of the death of gangster George ""Baby Face"" Nelson in this film is completely fictionalized. On November 27, 1934 (four months after Dillinger\'s death), Nelson encountered two FBI Agents, Samuel Cowley and Ed Hollis, in Barrington, Illinois, just outside Chicago. In a roadside battle, Nelson shot and killed both FBI Agents, but was mortally wounded. He escaped in a bullet-riddled car driven by his wife, and died that evening in a nearby safe-house. Nelson\'s body was found the next day, wrapped in a blanket, and lying in a ditch next to a cemetery in Skokie, Illinois. His wife placed a call to police, to tell them where to find the body.', u'In the movie, the first public enemy to get gunned down by the FBI is ""Pretty Boy"" Floyd, but in real-life, Floyd died three months after John Dillinger. His funeral was the largest in Oklahoma history, attracting an estimated twenty thousand people. The next one to get killed is ""Baby Face"" Nelson, where the Agents were shown chasing down Nelson during a raid of Dillinger\'s hideout. In reality, this was Nelson\'s most famous escape, and every single criminal got away unharmed. Dillinger and Baby Face went on to rob more banks, and Nelson wasn\'t actually killed until after Dillinger. In the movie, Dillinger was depicted as having fooled three prison guards with a wooden knife but in reality, he fooled seventeen.', u'Stephen Lang revealed that it took 220 takes to get it right where Winstead fires point blank at John Dillinger when leaving the theater.', u'At one point, Alvin Karpis is seen planning a federal reserve train robbery with John Dillinger. In real-life, the robbery was set up by an underworld associate of Dillinger, Karpis, and ""Baby Face"" Nelson, named William Murray. Interestingly, Murray had set up the exact same robbery, back in 1925, with the Newton Brothers (as seen in the film The Newton Boys (1998)). Although John Dillinger was killed before he could take part in the robbery, Alvin Carpis did pull it off on November 7, 1935.', u'In the scene where ""Baby Face"" Nelson kills FBI Agent Carter Baum, Nelson really did say ""I know you sons of bitches wear vests, so I\'m gonna hit you high and low!"" Also, the gun Nelson uses in that scene, a .45 automatic modified into a mini-machine gun, was something Nelson actually used (as did Homer Van Meter). It was made especially for Nelson by a gunsmith in San Antonio, Texas. The customized Colt Government Super 1911 used by Dillinger\'s gang, had a Thompson front grip attached to the frame, a Thompson Cutts compensator, an extended magazine, and was chambered for .38 Super. .38 Super ammunition was used by both Federal Agents and outlaws, due to the round\'s speed, allowing it to pierce body armor and engine blocks.', u'John Dillinger was shot and killed by FBI Agents on the night of July 22, 1934, while exiting Chicago\'s Biograph Theater, where he had attended a screening of Manhattan Melodrama (1934). While the Biograph Theater was still operating at the time of the production of this movie, the interior had been converted into several smaller venues, and no longer resembled the Depression-era movie palace it had been, at the time of Dillinger\'s death. Production scouts for this movie found that the Paramount Theatre in nearby Aurora, Illinois resembled the Biograph Theater of 1934 enough to double as that venue. For that reason, the interiors for two scenes were filmed there: The scene in which John Dillinger and his cohorts attend a movie, and are alarmed to see themselves and their photographs featured during a newsreel, and the scene taking place immediately prior to Dillinger\'s death. The exterior of the Biograph Theater during the latter scene, however, depicts that actual historic venue, ""dressed"" to appear as it did in 1934.', u'Channing Tatum (""Pretty Boy"" Floyd), Billy Crudup (J. Edgar Hoover), David Wenham (Harry Pierpont), and Christian Stolte (Charles Makley) are the only actors in the film playing characters their own age. All of the other actors in the film play characters much younger than themselves. Melvin Purvis was 28 years old during the events in the film, and Christian Bale was 35 during the shoot. John Dillinger was 31 at the time of his death, while Johnny Depp is 45 in the film. 35-year-old Stephen Graham is playing a 25-year-old Baby Face Nelson, Stephen Dorff, also 35, plays a 27-year-old Homer Van Meter, and Giovanni Ribisi, 34, plays 27-year-old Alvin Carpis.', u""The French title of the film Dillinger attends the night of his death, Manhattan Melodrama (1934), is L'ennemi public n\xb0 1.""]","[u'USA::18 June 2009 (Chicago, Illinois)\n (premiere)', u'USA::23 June 2009 (Los Angeles Film Festival)', u'Canada::1 July 2009', u'UK::1 July 2009', u'Ireland::1 July 2009', u'USA::1 July 2009', u'France::2 July 2009 (Paris Cin\xe9ma)', u'Greece::2 July 2009', u'Denmark::3 July 2009', u'Mexico::3 July 2009', u'Czech Republic::6 July 2009 (Karlovy Vary International Film Festival)', u'Switzerland::8 July 2009 (French speaking region)', u'France::8 July 2009', u'Indonesia::8 July 2009', u'Morocco::8 July 2009', u'Czech Republic::9 July 2009', u'Croatia::9 July 2009', u'Israel::9 July 2009', u'Malaysia::9 July 2009', u'Slovakia::9 July 2009', u'Bulgaria::10 July 2009', u'Estonia::10 July 2009', u'Latvia::10 July 2009', u'Turkey::10 July 2009', u'Hungary::16 July 2009', u'Poland::17 July 2009', u'Romania::17 July 2009', u'Netherlands::20 July 2009 (Amsterdam)\n (premiere)', u'Belgium::22 July 2009', u'Philippines::22 July 2009', u'United Arab Emirates::23 July 2009', u'Hong Kong::23 July 2009', u'Kazakhstan::23 July 2009', u'Russia::23 July 2009', u'Singapore::23 July 2009', u'Thailand::23 July 2009', u'Ukraine::23 July 2009', u'Brazil::24 July 2009', u'Norway::24 July 2009', u'Sweden::24 July 2009', u'Taiwan::24 July 2009', u'Egypt::29 July 2009', u'Argentina::30 July 2009', u'Australia::30 July 2009', u'Switzerland::30 July 2009 (German speaking region)', u'Chile::30 July 2009', u'Lebanon::30 July 2009', u'Netherlands::30 July 2009', u'New Zealand::30 July 2009', u'Iceland::5 August 2009', u'Germany::6 August 2009', u'Portugal::6 August 2009', u'Syria::6 August 2009', u'Austria::7 August 2009', u'India::7 August 2009', u'South Korea::13 August 2009', u'Peru::13 August 2009', u'Spain::14 August 2009', u'Finland::14 August 2009', u'Panama::14 August 2009', u'Colombia::21 August 2009', u'Uruguay::21 August 2009', u'Slovenia::10 September 2009', u'Italy::6 November 2009', u'Japan::12 December 2009']",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

She did appear as Desdemona in Othello, on 8 December at the theater on Vere Street operated by the King's Company, whose manager was Thomas Killigrew, not Thomas Betterton as the film shows. Betterton was a successful theater manager later, but was only 25 in 1660. Other characters also were not historically the age that they appear to be in the film.

Others have claimed, however, that Shelley\'s name was included in the title to avoid legal action from Universal Studios, who claimed to own the rights to the simple title Frankenstein (1931).', u'Kenneth Branagh and Sir Ian Holm appeared in Henry V (1989).', u'Robert De Niro and Sir Ian Holm appeared in Brazil (1985).', u'This film contains several references to previous Frankenstein films: The Creature is brought to life in a metallic vat, as in Frankenstein (1910). Victor cuts an executed criminal from a hangman\'s noose, and uses the body for his experiments, as in Frankenstein (1931) and Young Frankenstein (1974). The Creature is reanimated with electrical charges. This is an invention of Hollywood. The book is silent on how Victor creates the Creature. Once the Creature comes to life, Victor triumphantly shouts, ""It\'s alive!"" The Creature\'s first spoken word is ""friend"". This is also the Creature\'s most frequently-used word, when he learns to speak in Bride of Frankenstein (1935). Victor uses the brain of a brilliant scientist and mentor for his Creature, as in The Curse of Frankenstein (1957). Justine Moritz\'s role is also expanded, and is made to fall in love with Victor in both films. Victor\'s mentor, who paved the road for his experiments, brings a severed arm back to life, and shows it to Victor, as in Frankenstein: The True Story (1973). The Creature hides in some cottagers\' pigsty, and secretly learns to speak and read from observing them through a peephole. In the book, the cottagers are foreign refugees. In this film, the cottagers are simply local townsfolk. This variation on the novel was first used in Terror of Frankenstein (1977). Victor revives a mangled and hideous Elizabeth after the Creature murders her, and Victor and the Creature then engage in a battle for her affection. Horrified, the reanimated Elizabeth takes her own life. The same events take place, almost exactly, in Roger Corman\'s Frankenstein Unbound (1990). A cholera epidemic sweeps through Ingolstadt, leaving Victor to believe that the Creature died from disease. Frankenstein (1992) also featured a cholera epidemic under very similar circumstances, even though it is not present in the novel.', u'Kenneth Branagh did an uncredited re-write on the script. One of his additions was the scene where the reanimated Elizabeth sets herself on fire.', u'The end version makes it look like Henry Clerval was killed, but deleted scenes show he and the Frankenstein Servants survive the fire.', u""Producers were resistant to William's on-screen death.""]","[u'UK::4 November 1994', u'Ireland::4 November 1994', u'USA::4 November 1994', u'Argentina::1 December 1994', u'Australia::1 December 1994', u'Germany::5 January 1995', u'France::11 January 1995', u'Spain::13 January 1995', u'Sweden::13 January 1995', u'Netherlands::19 January 1995', u'Brazil::20 January 1995', u'Finland::20 January 1995', u'Japan::21 January 1995', u'Denmark::27 January 1995', u'Portugal::27 January 1995', u'Poland::3 February 1995', u'Hungary::9 February 1995', u'Italy::9 February 1995', u'Turkey::24 February 1995', u'South Korea::4 March 1995', u'Philippines::22 March 1995', u'Greece::26 November 1998 (DVD premiere)']",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Christian Bale played Batman in Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy, Amy Adams played Lois Lane in Man of Steel (2013), Jeremy Renner played Hawkeye in Marvel's Avengers Saga, Jennifer Lawrence played young Mystique in X-Men: First Class (2011) and Bradley Cooper voiced Rocket Raccoon in Guardians of the Galaxy (2014)."", u""Costume designer Michael Wilkinson came up with a specific wardrobe scheme for Amy Adams. To subtly show Sydney's emotion and physical vulnerability, he deliberately made her clothing close-fitting, with no bras. For scenes where Sydney shows her supreme confidence in the con job, he used plenty of Diane Von Furstenberg wrap dresses. He also got unprecedented access to Halston's entire 1970s dress collection."", u""In the early 1980s, French director Louis Malle was preparing a film of the Abscam story called Moon Over Miami, from a script Malle had written with John Guare.

His hammed up dancing/singing is a result of this research.', u'Once, while a guest on British talk show host Stephen Merchant\'s show, the comedian Louis C.K. joked about the students in the audience on Inside the Actors Studio (1994) who ask famous actors for career advice: ""It always occurs to me, you know, when an actor stands up - one of the people in the audience - \'I am an actor, what can I do\' and asks Sean Penn or whoever \'what can I do to reach your level,\' you just want to say \'you will never be famous!\'"" Louis costarred in this film with Bradley Cooper, who was not only one of those Actors Studio students in the audience in several episodes (including one featuring Robert De Niro, who was also in the film) but also specifically one of the students who asked Penn a question during his episode.', u'American Hustle (2013) reunites the following actors who have collaborated with David O.

Russell initially shot Rosalyn\'s housecleaning scene to her singing ""Evil Ways"" by Santana, but decided at the last minute after shooting it that the scene would go better with Paul McCartney and Wings\' title song from Live and Let Die (1973). According to actress Colleen Camp, she helped Russell secure the rights to use the song on the soundtrack from her longtime friend, James Bond producer Barbara Broccoli within half an hour. Camp performed the clearance over phone calls from California to London while she was in the hospital receiving treatment for a blood clot in her knee. After contacting Russell (who was on location in Boston) that permission was granted, he immediately re-shot the scene with Jennifer Lawrence and Danny Corbo & Sonny Corbo, and cut it into the final film. Both finished versions of the scene are available to watch on DVD and Blu-Ray. ""Evil Ways"" was ultimately used at the Camden City Hall gala when Rosalyn approaches the mobsters.', u'David O.

This didn\'t become public knowledge until 1996, and the full live performance was finally released in 1999. Ellington hated the idea of doctoring his Newport live recordings, walked out on one of the sessions where the studio inserts were recorded, and refused to work with Avakian again.', u'While American Hustle references a U.S. Senator caught in the Abscam scandal, it does not name him.

The other two actors (Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence) appeared in Silver Linings Playbook and were nominated for Best Actor and Actress at the 2013 Oscars, with Lawrence winning her category. In this film all four actors were again nominated, however they all switched categories, as Bale and Adams were nominated for Lead Actor and Lead Actress, while Cooper and Lawrence were nominated for Supporting Actor and Actress. None of them one their categories, despite the film's ten Oscar nominations."", u'The fight scene that takes place in the bedroom between Christian Bale and Jennifer Lawrence is completely improvised.

""None of that was improvised, absolutely not,"" asserts Lawrence. ""I\'m a terrible dancer, so I would never have been able to do any of that. When it finally came together, that scene really was just as fun as it feels."" Lawrence even mentioned that compared to her, Cooper took to dancing quite naturally, when in fact it\'s her character Tiffany that\'s supposed to be the experienced dancer, and Pat, the amateur.', u'Shot in 33 days.', u'Among its 8 Academy Award nominations, this film became the first to earn nods in all four acting categories since Reds (1981) and the first ""Big Five"" (Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Director, Best Writing) nominee since Million Dollar Baby (2004). Director David O. Russell repeated the same rare feat the following year with American Hustle (2013).', u'David O. Russell was drawn to the story because of the family relationships, and also because of the connection to his own son Matthew Antonio Grillo Russell, who is bipolar and has OCD.', u'It took five years and 25 rewrites before David O. Russell could direct it himself as Sydney Pollack told him it was tricky to have emotional, troubling, funny and romantic content mixed together.', u'Tiffany\'s appearance was originally more ""goth"", Jennifer Lawrence dyed her hair black and wore heavy dark makeup for costume tests but Harvey Weinstein disapproved, so the goth elements were toned down. Lawrence was also advised by David O. Russell to gain weight for the role.', u'The Russian title of this film translates as ""My Boyfriend Is a Psycho"".', u""Harvard Medical School psychiatrist Dr. Steven Schlozman was interviewed about this film and its depictions of mental illness for the December 3, 2012 edition of Vulture. He diagnosed Tiffany's unnamed condition as Borderline Personality Disorder."", u'David O. Russell has said in interviews that one of the main reasons why he cast Bradley Cooper was that, seeing his work, he noticed that sometimes Cooper looked really angry and trying to suppress it, something he needed for the character of Pat.', u'The results of Eagles and Phillies games mentioned in the movie are all real and all took place in 2008.', u'During an interview with the National Public Radio program ""Weekend Edition Sunday,"" Jacki Weaver said that David O. Russell gave her and Robert De Niro a back-story for their characters that included the fact that even though they had been married for 30-plus years, they still make love twice a week.', u'The title ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a source of confusion for some, especially people not very familiar with idiomatic English. The ""Silver Linings"" part of the title comes from the common expression ""every cloud has a silver lining,"" which means ""look on the bright side"" or ""nothing is all bad."" The first documented use of the phrase in this way is from John Milton\'s 1634 work ""Comus I."" A ""Playbook"" is a written or mental list of athletic strategies that a coach creates to guide a team through a game or a sport. So in combination, the title refers to an arsenal of strategies for Pat to use while trying to look on the brighter side of life. Similar expressions were used in foreign releases, such as: ""The Bright Side of Things"", ""The Bright Side of Life"", or ""Games of Destiny"" (Spain/Latin America), ""Optimistic Guide"" (Greece), ""Happiness Therapy"" (France), ""Positive Thinking"" (Italy), ""Guide for Ultimate Happiness"" (Portugal), ""My Light of Hope"" (Turkey), and ""Sunny Side"" (Hungary) to name a few.', u'David O. Russell mentioned in an interview that he originally had Zooey Deschanel and Vince Vaughn in mind for the lead roles as he was writing the script.', u'Jennifer Lawrence was more impressed with one of her co-stars than with the others.

""Robert De Niro is standing right next to Jacki Weaver, and I go straight to Jacki and am like, \'Oh my God, I love Animal Kingdom (2010)! I love you!\'""', u'Just like his role in the film, Bradley Cooper is from Philadelphia and is a huge Philadelphia Eagles fan.', u""Mark Wahlberg was cast in the lead role but director David O.

The Other 3 are: American Hustle (2013), Serena (2014), and Joy (2015).', u'The Weinstein Company bought the rights to the book before it was published and planned for Sydney Pollack and Anthony Minghella to produce, before they both died in 2008.', u""In the original novel on which the film is based, the character of Tiffany is in her mid-30s. Jennifer Lawrence was 22 at the time of the film's release."", u'Jennifer Lawrence auditioned via Skype.', u'Rachel McAdams, Olivia Wilde, Elizabeth Banks, Blake Lively, Rooney Mara, Kirsten Dunst and Andrea Riseborough were considered for the lead female role that went to Jennifer Lawrence.', u'Throughout the movie, Dolores (Jacki Weaver) announces to her family and visiting friends that she has made ""crabby snacks and homemades"" for them to eat while watching football. Many critics and viewers outside of the Philadelphia area assumed this was some sort of term for a Philadelphia Eagles food tradition, but most Philadelphia-area viewers were just as mystified by the term as everyone else. Weaver herself, in a November 2012 New York Magazine interview, admitted that she couldn\'t remember what the term meant, although she had known at the time of shooting the movie. Finally, the Philadelphia Daily News reported that ""crabby snacks"" are a canap\xe9 that Doreen Quick (mother of Matthew Quick who wrote this story) used to make for game days and other gatherings. The recipe consists of canned crabmeat and processed cheese cooked together and spread onto English muffins, and cut into quarters. ""Homemades"" are beef rolls covered with bread crumbs and simmered in tomato sauce.', u'This is the first film, other than a Rush Hour (1998) movie, that Chris Tucker has been in since Jackie Brown (1997) in 1997. Both films feature Robert De Niro.', u'When Tiffany runs out of the diner and Pat chases her on their raisin bran ""date"" and they stop in front of the movie theater on Halloween to argue; the movie on the marquee is The Midnight Meat Train (2008), a previous Bradley Cooper picture.', u'In the early release version of the movie Pat Sr. incorrectly states the Eagles beat the Cowboys 21 to 6. In the wide release version the correct score of the 2008 game has been dubbed in, and his character states the Eagles won 44-6.', u'Emma Thompson turned down the role of Dolores.', u'Anne Hathaway was originally cast opposite Bradley Cooper, but dropped out due to scheduling conflicts.', u'David O. Russell tried to get the movie made for a number of years, and the big success of The Fighter (2010) finally allowed him to do so.', u'The title does not appear anywhere in the movie, except at the very end of the end credits.', u""Bradley Cooper previously auditioned for the role of Robert De Niro's son in Everybody's Fine (2009). He lost out to Sam Rockwell."", u'The song played at Pat and Nikki\'s wedding (and later used to trigger Pat\'s mental breakdowns) is Stevie Wonder\'s ""My Cherie Amour"". The song itself is about an unrequited love, much like Pat\'s one-sided love for Nikki.', u'The line Pat says to his brother in the ""good for me bad for you"" scene is also the title of a Heavy D song in which Chris Tucker was featured in the video. ""I got nothing but love for you brother"".', u""The dance routine that Tiffany shows Pat on her iPod is from Singin' in the Rain (1952) and features Gene Kelly and Donald O'Connor. They subsequently include part of this sequence in their routine for the competition."", u'The book that Pat tosses out the window is A Farewell to Arms by Ernest Hemingway.', u'Jennifer Lawrence does not appear until about 25 minutes into the film.', u'Despite a large part of the plot, and the last word of the title, being related to American football fandom, there is actually very little football to be seen in the film. The only time that the viewer gets to see the game actually being played on screen is on a small screen while the dance competition is going on.', u'The title in Thailand translates ""Love You Like Crazy.""', u'Co-stars Shea Whigham and Bradley Cooper, who play brothers in the film, share their birthday, January 5.', u'Angelina Jolie was considered for a role.', u'Jennifer Lawrence earned the Academy Award for Best Actress for her role as Tiffany. This was the first time she has earned the highly acclaimed honour.', u'""My Cherie Amour"" by Stevie Wonder, is Pat\'s (Bradley Cooper) trigger. He gets violent when he hears it. In the book the trigger was ""Songbird"" by Kenny G.', u'Bradley Cooper is a Philadelphia Eagles fan just like his character Pat.', u'Robert De Niro and Bradley Cooper second film together.', u""In the book written by Matthew Quick, Pat's mother's name is Jeanie, not Dolores."", u'Parts of this movie were filmed in the small Pennsylvania town of Ridley park', u""This movie marks Robert DeNiro's first Oscar nomination in 22 years. He was last nominated for Awakenings (1991)."", u'Throughout the movie Pat and Tiffany wear their wedding rings from their past marriages, although these are finished. But in the last scene it can be see that they no longer wear them.', u'Jacki Weaver contributed to a critical aspect of the film. ""I was sitting there with 300 other people in the ballroom watching the dance scene,"" she recalls. ""It\'s crucial that they get 5 points in order to win the parlay bet. The judges kept holding up their scores in take after take. I\'m not great at math, but I kept adding them up thinking, \'That doesn\'t add up to 5.\' So I told one of the producers that it didn\'t average 5 and he said, \'Oh my God!\' and they changed it. So yeah, I saved the film.""', u""Pat Sr.'s OCD requires his TV remotes to always be on the table next to the couch facing a certain way.

The SAS even went on the record to disown both Fiennes and the book, with Lt-Col Ian Smith telling the Daily Mail 'It was utter b****, the figment of a fertile imagination.

He's made his money out of the book. He should come clean. When the book came out saying Mike had been murdered, we knew it wasn't true.

At The 64th Annual Golden Globe Awards (2007), Tim Allen mispronounced the show\'s name as ""3rd Rock"" when mentioning that Alec Baldwin had been nominated for the Best Actor in a Television Comedy or Musical Award. Both shows featured guest appearances by Elaine Stritch as the mother of one of the main characters.', u'Tina Fey and Scott Adsit both did voice work for the pinball game Medieval Madness.', u'Donald Glover, who was a staff writer for 30 Rock from 2008-2009, also appeared on camera in several fleeting appearances during that period (for instance, as Young P.A in ""Jack-Tor"" or as Gay Kid in ""Kidney Now!""). After he left the staff of 30 Rock for a role on Community (which made him a star), he returned to play Young Tracy Jordan in the 2012 live episode. During an April 2012 interview with Entertainment Weekly, Tina Fey said that they already knew that Glover ""could sound like Tracy, because we did an extended version of [Tracy Jordan\'s novelty song] \'Werewolf Bar Mitzvah,\' and by the time we finished it, we were wrapped and didn\'t have Tracy. So half of it is just Donald imitating Tracy.""', u'A running gag is the mispronunciation of the film ""Rural Juror"", which Jenna starred in series 1. It is often just pronounced as ""Rrurr Jjurr"". In the season 7 finale, Jenna sings the theme song of the musical ""Rural Juror"". The song itself has utterly incomprehensible lyrics for the public. However, it is the first time Jenna pronounces ""Rural Juror"" correctly. One of the lyrics that was pronounced perfectly was ""I----- will never forget you, rural juror."" The sentiment can be interpreted as Jenna/Jane/the writers of 30 Rock expressing their sadness over the show\'s end.', u""Rachel Dratch's appearance as various characters throughout the show is a fourth-wall-busting display of improv, a topic in many of the episodes."", u'Will Forte, Mary Steenbergen, and Kristen Schaal all guest starred on 30 Rock before going on to star in The Last Man on Earth (2015-)', u'Tina Fey (Liz Lemon), Jack McBrayer (Kenneth Parcell), and Scott Adsit (Pete Hornberger) have all provided their voices for work in Disney films. Fey in Monkey Kingdom (2015), McBrayer starred as Fix It Felix in Wreck It Ralph (2012), and Adsit as Baymax in Big Hero 6 (2014).', u'Over the course of the series, there were many hints that Kenneth was considerably older than the character\'s outward appearance would suggest (the actor who plays Kenneth, Jack McBrayer, was in his early 30s when ""30 Rock"" started). These include: Kenneth\'s recognition of TV pop culture from decades before he logically would have been born; he\'s familiar with the laws of the Roman Republic and fluent in Latin; his anxiety in ""Don Geiss, America and Hope"" that NBC will start limiting and verifying the ages of their pages and his concern in ""The Problem Solvers"" that people in the office have been spreading a rumor that he\'s ""been alive forever""; his memory that an eight-year-old \'Shirley Temple (I)\' taught him how to roll cigarettes; his refusal to tell Suze Orman his age in ""Today You Are a Man""; his on-screen identification as ""Kenneth Parcell: Elderly Page"" in ""Queen of Jordan""; and many other jokes and references. In the episode ""Governor Dunston,"" Kenneth\'s mother (Catherine O\'Hara) visits and tells Jenna that Kenneth has ""always been a special boy. I remember the day he was born. He looked up at me and said, \'Momma, I am not a person. My body\'s just a flesh vessel for an immortal being whose name if you heard it would make you lose your mind.\'"" In the last episode of the series, Kenneth looks to be exactly the same even many decades in the future, still the president of NBC, hearing a series pitch from Liz\'s great-granddaughter; many viewers speculated that that meant that Kenneth is actually immortal.', u'Kenneth said in an episode that when he first started at NBC, an 8 year old Shirley Temple taught him how to roll a cigarette. Shirley Temple was born in 1928 which means Kenneth started at NBC in 1936.', u""The show often pokes fun at themes and characters that the show leaves hanging. For example, in one episode, Kenneth tells Liz that no more mail could fit into her box because it was stuffed with unopened adoption letters, hinting at Liz's disappeared interest to adopt a child. Another instance is the character of Danny Baker. In one episode, Pete tells Danny that he would've asked Danny to do a favor for him, but he forgot he works at TGS, poking fun at the fact that Danny often goes missing for several episodes at a time. Again, in the 100th episode, Danny states that he remembers season 1 of TGS, even though he hadn't worked there yet, but then later in the episode has Josh's flashbacks, meaning that Danny and Josh share the same fate in which they both appear in several episodes and then are never heard from again."", u'Elizabeth Banks played a character on Scrubs (2001) who was impregnated by a character named J.D.

The man playing the husband is the head of the sound department for the movie, Les Lazarowitz, who being a heavyset guy made the scene even more comical. He deferred the sound mixing duties to his assistant while this scene was being filmed. Coincidentally, Lazarowitz was the boom operator (uncredited) in the fruit stand scene of The Godfather (1972), which is parodied in Analyze This (1999).', u'Robert De Niro suggested Chazz Palminteri for the role of Primo Sidone, having worked with him on A Bronx Tale (1993).', u'Robert De Niro picked out the shirt collars used by Vitti and his crew.', u'In the movie, Dr. Sobel dreams that he is shot by some gangsters while buying fruits from a fruit stand.

Victor cuts an executed criminal from a hangman\'s noose, and uses the body for his experiments, as in Frankenstein (1931) and Young Frankenstein (1974). The Creature is reanimated with electrical charges. This is an invention of Hollywood. The book is silent on how Victor creates the Creature. Once the Creature comes to life, Victor triumphantly shouts, ""It\'s alive!"" The Creature\'s first spoken word is ""friend"". This is also the Creature\'s most frequently-used word, when he learns to speak in Bride of Frankenstein (1935). Victor uses the brain of a brilliant scientist and mentor for his Creature, as in The Curse of Frankenstein (1957). Justine Moritz\'s role is also expanded, and is made to fall in love with Victor in both films. Victor\'s mentor, who paved the road for his experiments, brings a severed arm back to life, and shows it to Victor, as in Frankenstein: The True Story (1973). The Creature hides in some cottagers\' pigsty, and secretly learns to speak and read from observing them through a peephole. In the book, the cottagers are foreign refugees. In this film, the cottagers are simply local townsfolk. This variation on the novel was first used in Terror of Frankenstein (1977). Victor revives a mangled and hideous Elizabeth after the Creature murders her, and Victor and the Creature then engage in a battle for her affection. Horrified, the reanimated Elizabeth takes her own life. The same events take place, almost exactly, in Roger Corman\'s Frankenstein Unbound (1990).

It is assumed to be a bribe but the amount inside is never revealed. In real life, Al Capone promised Eliot Ness that two 1,000 dollar notes would be on his desk every Monday morning if he turned a blind eye to his bootlegging activities (an enormous amount of money then).

Hoskins called De Palma and asked if there were any more movies he did not want him to be in.', u'The scene where Al Capone (Robert De Niro) pulls out a baseball bat at a dinner party and suddenly beats to death one of his men is based on a true incident which happened on May 7, 1929. Two of Capone\'s most feared hit men, Albert Anselmi and John Scalise, had hatched a plot to kill Capone and take over his gang. Capone got wind of it and invited all his associates to a dinner party, including Anselmi and Scalise. In the middle of the party, Capone pulled out a baseball bat and battered both men to death, then shot them both in the head. A conflicting version of the story has Tony ""Joe Batters"" Accardo, one of Capone\'s hit men, as the man who bludgeoned the traitors to death.', u'Despite the final courtroom scene in this movie, the real Al Capone and Eliot Ness never came face to face during their battles.', u""Robert De Niro hadn't much time to gain the extra weight needed for his role, so that he had to wear pads and pillows for the desired effect of looking like the chunkier Capone."", u'Though the patron saints of police are Michael the Archangel and Saint Sebastian, Irish police officers often carried Saint Jude medals, the patron saint of hopeless causes.', u""The set for Capone's personal barbershop at the Lexington Hotel, included several small items (cologne bottles, shaving brushes) that belonged to the real Al Capone."", u""In the original script, the final gunfight had Eliot Ness and George Stone battling Capone gunmen on a stopped train.

No Chicago newspaper carried news of his passing. His heroic reputation only began with the posthumous publication of the Untouchables book he had co-written with Oscar Fraley and the television series adapted from it.', u'In real life, Eliot Ness brought the only non-tax-related charges against Al Capone which resulted in 5,000 separate Volstead Act indictments.', u'According to Brian De Palma and Art Linson in the DVD documentary, it was Sean Connery\'s idea to film the ""blood oath"" scene between Ness and Malone in a Catholic church. Originally it was going to take place on the street (in the same scene that follows the church scene). Connery felt that a church would be the only ""safe"" place in Chicago where the two characters would make such a commitment to fight Capone.', u'The movie portrays Eliot Ness as being happily married and his wife having a daughter and a baby son. In real-life, Eliot Ness had been married three times (he was married to his first wife Edna Staley during the time frame where he was pursuing Al Capone) and the only child he ever had, was an adopted son.', u""There was originally a different ending for the movie. It was to have been a scene with the camera shooting a close up of Robert De Niro's face as it is being warmed up for a shave. Then, the camera would have pulled up while still focused on Capone to show the audience that he has reporters around him, much like the opening scene of the film, but this time, he is in his jail cell."", u""Brian De Palma later modified the battle-on-the-train sequence he planned for this film and used it in Carlito's Way (1993)."", u""Fashion icon Giorgio Armani, who provided the costumes for the film, told Brian De Palma that he should cast Don Johnson as Eliot Ness.

Wilson had been working on this project since 1928, and had next to nothing to do with Ness and the Untouchables in real-life. Wilson was not killed by Capone, though Capone reportedly placed a contract on his life which was never carried out.', u'Paramount Pictures made this film, because they still held the filming rights to Eliot Ness\' autobiography, which they used to produce the television series The Untouchables (1959). Originally, Paramount intended to make this, like so many other films since, as a big screen adaptation of a television series. However, Brian De Palma, producer Art Linson, and writer David Mamet, all felt that they didn\'t want to remake the series, so they took their own dramatic license with the story, and the true events that inspired it, in order to make, what they felt would be, a good big screen epic. (This is according to De Palma and Linson in the DVD ""Making-of"" documentary).', u'The radio show listened to by Eliot Ness and his wife early in the movie is an actual episode of Amos and Andy.

This is a half convex glass in front of the actual lens to make one half nearsighted and the other farsighted. The result is foreground and background (here both actors) are both in focus. The effect can only be achieved when there is nearly no actors or camera movement and is often used to create more mystery.

Terry agreed, and took advantage of the situation by preparing to bring an ""audio visual aid"", which was his cut of the film, which would have been allowed. Unfortunately, two days before the event, students advertised a free screening of the film. When he arrived, it was announced that Universal would not allow him to show the film. During his speech to the class, he was interrupted by studio executives\' phone calls. They eventually allowed him to show a clip of the film. He showed the entire film, and repeated the screenings for over two weeks. It was during one of these screenings, that Los Angeles film critics saw the film, and awarded it the Best Picture of the Year award, which was responsible for getting the film released the way Gilliam wanted it.', u'Terry Gilliam and his crew were excited to have Robert De Niro on-board at first, but as time wore on, they found De Niro\'s need for ""research"", and obsession with details, increasingly irritating, with Gilliam saying that he ""wanted to strangle him"".', u'Robert De Niro wanted to play the role of Jack, but Terry Gilliam had already promised this to Michael Palin. De Niro still wanted to be in the film, so he was cast as Tuttle instead.', u'The second in Terry Gilliam\'s ""Trilogy of Imagination"". The first was Time Bandits (1981), and the third was The Adventures of Baron Munchausen (1988). All three films are about escapes from an awkward, ordered society, seen through the eyes of a child, a man in his 30s, and an elderly man.', u'The myth behind the name of the film relates to Terry Gilliam being at a beach in the UK one day. Apparently the weather wasn\'t particularly great, but a man was sitting on the beach alone listening to the famous song (on a stereo) that we hear in the film. Gilliam was fascinated by the man sitting there despite all the ""adversity"", and this became the theme and name for the film.', u'During his trouble with the studio, Terry Gilliam asked Daily Variety for a full page ad, which cost around fifteen hundred dollars at the time. He had it bordered like a funeral invitation, and it said: ""Dear Sid Sheinberg, when are you going to release my film? Signed: Terry Gilliam.""', u""The samurai sequence was originally conceived to reflect Terry Gilliam's love for Akira Kurosawa films."", u'Despite the problems Terry Gilliam had directing Robert De Niro, De Niro said he had a wonderful time on the production, and would gladly work with Gilliam again.', u'While most of the actors and actresses needed only two to three takes, Robert De Niro insisted on twenty-five to thirty takes for his character, and he still managed to forget his lines. His part was eventually filmed in two weeks, rather than the one week Terry Gilliam envisioned.', u'In the autumn of 1985, Terry Gilliam and Robert De Niro appeared on Good Morning America (1975) to promote this film which was finished, but not yet released. Gilliam was struggling with the studio and the studio head, Sid Sheinberg, quite publicly. De Niro rarely made television appearances, but agreed to help Gilliam out. According to Gilliam ""Bobby (De Niro) said very little, he was talkative that day, so we might have gotten him to ten words."" Host Joan Lunden asked Gilliam, ""I hear you\'re having trouble with the studio, is this correct?"" Gilliam responded with ""No, I\'m having trouble with Sid Sheinberg, here is an 8x10 photo of him"", and showed the entire nation his photograph. Sheinberg was reportedly furious with this incident, and it helped Gilliam get the release of the film done the way he wanted.', u'An early title for this movie was ""1984 and \xbd"", an homage to Federico Fellini and 8\xbd (1963), but the film 1984 (1984) was released, and the idea was scrapped, as there would have been legal trouble with the George Orwell estate.', u'During the time when the studio was blocking the release of the film, and were re-editing it for the infamous ""Love conquers all"" version, copies of the Director\'s Cut were circulating on video around Hollywood. At one point, several critics began asking if a film that had been completed, but not released, could be eligible for a Best Picture Oscar. It\'s said that the potential embarrassment of this happening, forced the studio to release the original version, instead of their new one.', u""The creepy mask Michael Palin wore in the film, was based on a similar mask Terry Gilliam's mother gave him once."", u'According to Terry Gilliam in the book ""The Battle of Brazil: Terry Gilliam v.

Phoenix never met him."", u'Terry Gilliam was reported to have been rather unhappy with Kim Greist\'s performance, and as a result, many of her scenes were drastically cut or trimmed down. Some of these were added for the Sid Sheinberg ""Love Conquers All"" studio version.', u'Terry Gilliam admitted that the film was inspired by George Orwell\'s 1984, although he never actually read the book. He jokingly referred to it as ""1984 and a half.""', u'Mrs. Buttle never blinks during the extended monologue Sam gives, when he comes over to her apartment.', u'According to Maxim Magazine, Terry Gilliam was reportedly so stressed during filming, that he lost all feeling in his legs for a week.', u'Terry Gilliam tested more than half a dozen actresses to play the part of Jill, interviewing or testing Rosanna Arquette, Ellen Barkin, Jamie Lee Curtis, Rebecca De Mornay, Rae Dawn Chong, Kelly McGillis, Joanna Pacula, Kathleen Turner, and he even considered Madonna. Gilliam\'s personal favorite was Barkin, because he thought she had a great combination of sex appeal and toughness, that would work for the character. He stated later that while Kim Griest gave an excellent audition, and his close circle of friends and family advisors liked her, he mainly picked her for the role, because she had only one film credit to that date (C.H.U.D. (1984)), and this would enable her to create a truly original character for audiences, without any prior expectations. He also said that working with Griest, who was difficult on-set, and whose material had to be severely reduced to help the film, drove home that ""experience really does count for something.""', u'When Mr. Kurtzmann (Sir Ian Holm) discovers the cowboy movie playing on the computer monitors in the Records Department, the accompanying music is ""Flying Messenger"" by Oliver Armstrong, the same music used during Lancelot\'s attack on Swamp Castle in Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975) which Terry Gilliam co-directed.', u'The dates, on Buttle\'s (Brian Miller\'s) paperwork, show he was received by the MOI on June 31, 1984. This would be another reference to it being called ""1984 and a half"", since it is half way through the year.', u'The dream scenes were initially meant to form just one long sequence in the middle of the film, but technical difficulties made this impossible. The most important part of the dream sequence was intended to be a scene where Sam flies over a field of eyes, which then start slowly moving to follow his descent on a pillar. The eyes were made of snooker balls with false irises added. The eye symbol is also seen in other Terry Gilliam films including Twelve Monkeys (1995). The decision was later made to split the remaining dream scenes to fill the ""empty"" spaces between chapters.', u""In preparation for the role, Robert De Niro witnessed neurologists performing brain surgery, because he likened his character's job to that of a brain surgeon."", u""To Terry Gilliam's puzzlement, the film is popular among the American Right."", u'Charles McKeown, who shared writing credit on this movie, wrote most of the propaganda slogans that can be seen in the background throughout the film. He also played Harvey Lime.', u'(At around twelve minutes) The poster which reads, ""Information is the key to Prosperity / Ministry of Information"", is a reference to a Soviet 1923 advertisement poster, ""Rezinotrest"", made by Vladimir Mayakovsky. The movie poster uses the same colors and style (half of the word ""Prosperity"" is green, half is red, similar to the word ""Rezinotrest"" on the original poster).', u'The technician who, right at the start of the film, swats the fly which falls into the printer, causing the fatal misprint, is Ray Cooper, the percussionist who, among other things, accompanied Sir Elton John on his famous Russian concerts in 1979.', u'In the commentary, Terry Gilliam states that the restaurant bombing scene was inspired by the I.R.A. bombings that occurred in London when Gilliam lived there.', u'The reference to form 27B/6, without which no work can be done by repairmen of the Department of Public Works, is a reference to George Orwell, who lived at Canonbury Square Apartment 27B, Floor 6, while writing parts of 1984.', u'In 2013, Terry Gilliam called this the first installment of a dystopian satire trilogy it forms with Twelve Monkeys (1995) and The Zero Theorem (2013).', u""Jonathan Pryce's role as Sam was written several years earlier with him in mind. The character was originally designed to be in his mid twenties (Pryce was only about thirty when Terry Gilliam was developing the script), but after many years in limbo, Gilliam changed the character's age to mid to late thirties, so that thirty-seven-year-old Pryce could still play the role."", u""The hands seen manipulating Tuttle's tools belonged to Terry Gilliam, not Robert De Niro."", u'Lots of significant names: - Mr. Kurtzman: (German for ""short man""): small in stature and success.

Gilliam eventually won out, and Sheinberg, rather than face embarrassment at keeping such a lauded film from the public, gave in to Gilliam's demands. It's especially ironic, given the film's themes of an individual standing up to the system. The only difference is Lowry lost, and Gilliam won. The struggle is recounted in The Battle for Brazil: Terry Gilliam v. Universal Pictures, written by Jack Matthews in 1987."", u'Terry Gilliam had trouble with studio producers over the dark ending he wanted on the film. The producers wanted a ""happy Hollywood"" film, which eliminated (among other things) the final transition, and a critical line of dialogue, which reveals the tragic fate of Jill. These changes were made, and this ""butchered"" version was shown on U.S. television at least once. Gilliam threatened to disown the film, and consequently the cinematic release, and all videotape versions show the film essentially as he intended it to be seen (although the U.S. cinematic release still omitted the line about Jill).', u'When Harry (Robert De Niro) rescues Sam (Jonathan Pryce) from the Ministry of Information, as they escape through the lobby, the Security Police walk in unison down the stairs in a single rank firing their guns. Meanwhile, a vacuum cleaner rolls down the stairs ahead one step at a time.

When you rearrange those letters it spells JEREMIAH, Sam's father's name."", u'The ""Brazil"" theme is heard several times within the film. When Sam types ""Ere I am JH"" into the secret elevator\'s control panel, it plays the first eight notes. This is also what he hums when he sends the refund check up the pneumatic tube at Mr. Kurtzmann\'s office.

Leone was very taken with the book, and it served as his major inspiration in making a gangster film that would capture the spirit of America.', u'During filming, Sergio Leone hailed Robert De Niro as a much better actor than Clint Eastwood, whom Leone had frequently directed (and who Leone had been jealous of as at that time Eastwood was getting more directorial acclaim than he was). However, afterwards Leone made his peace with Eastwood and retracted these statements.', u""It is James Woods's opinion that this film was Sergio Leone's finest work."", u'It reportedly took many years for Sergio Leone to secure the rights to Harry Grey\'s book ""The Hoods"", on which this film was based, because another producer, Dan Curtis, held the rights and wasn\'t willing to give them up. So in 1976 Leone turned to producer Alberto Grimaldi, who persuaded Curtis to give up the rights in exchange for Grimaldi financing Burnt Offerings (1976), a replacement movie starring Oliver Reed and Bette Davis.', u'By 1980, Sergio Leone spoke of casting Paul Newman as old Noodles and Tom Berenger as young Noodles; the role of Max going to Dustin Hoffman, William Hurt, Jon Voight, Harvey Keitel or John Malkovich; Liza Minnelli would be Deborah and Brooke Shields as young Deborah; and Claudia Cardinale would be Carol.', u'To prepare a draft of the script, writer Norman Mailer barricaded himself in a Rome hotel with whiskey bottles, boxes of Cuban cigars and a typewriter for three weeks.

The other is The Deer Hunter (1978).', u""According to Sergio Donati, from 1967-77 all Sergio Leone had for the film was an opening scene: the corpse of an old gangster falls into the Hudson River and sinks to the bottom, where an underwater neighborhood of bodies is revealed. Leone devised this scene with writer Robert Dillon, who then pilfered it for John Frankenheimer's film 99 and 44/100% Dead (1974)."", u'In their childhood, the boys deal with hoods named Bugsy and Al Capuano. These names are probable homages to real-life gangsters Bugs Moran and Al Capone.', u'According to an interview with Stuart Kaminsky (special edition DVD), the outline that was given to him was around 200 pages. Kaminsky was asked by Sergio Leone to fill in the dialog in the 200-page outline.

This version scrapped the flashback structure Leone used, and instead arranged all the scenes in chronological order (a well-meaning but ultimately demeaning and criticized move). Most of the major cuts were in the childhood scenes, making the 1933 scenes the most prominent part of the film. Noodles\' 1968 meeting with Deborah was removed, and the film\'s ""garbage truck/opium den"" conclusion was altered to Secretary Bailey shooting himself off screen. This version flopped in the U.S. and many American critics, who knew of Leone\'s original cut, attacked the short version viciously; some critics compared shortening the film to shortening Richard Wagner\'s operas (some of which run over five hours), saying that works of art that are meant to be long should be given the respect they deserve.', u""Robert De Niro suggested that James Woods wear a set of perfect, bright white teeth to demonstrate Secretary Bailey's wealth and vanity.

Scott Fitzgerald's novel 'The Great Gatsby', about a man who becomes wealthy and powerful to become worthy of the woman he loves."", u""Sergio Leone hinted that the final scene of the film (Noodles hiding in a opium den in 1933, high on opium) could suggest that the film was a dream/vision induced by opium. Opium users often report of experiencing vivid fantasies, which tend to explore the user's past and future."", u""In 1968, Deborah is acting in William Shakespeare's play play 'Anthony and Cleopatra.' This sums up Noodles and Deborah's relationship: Noodles is enchanted and frustrated by Deborah, as she leads him on and turns him down; and it is not until the play's conclusion that she reveals her true feelings for him."", u'Sergio Leone intended that the film be a tribute to early gangster films: Noodles\' visit to his childhood home is similar to Dead End (1937)Noodles\' nostalgia for the days of his youth was taken from High Sierra (1941)as in Angels with Dirty Faces (1938), two boyhood chums grow up to be very different, and one of them visits their childhood hangouts and remembers the old daysthe changing times bring a new era of unions and politics, similar to Bullets or Ballots (1936)the gangster (Max) who gradually turns paranoid comes from White Heat (1949)the suitcase at the train station pays homage to Cry of the City (1948) and The Killing (1956)the inscription ""Your men will fall by the sword"" was taken from Little Caesar (1931)the relationship between Noodles and Deborah is similar to Eddie and Jean\'s romance from The Roaring Twenties (1939)the Chinese theatre scenes are a tribute to The Lady from Shanghai (1947)and Noodles\' arrival at Senator Bailey\'s house parallels a scene in The Big Heat (1953).', u'The number 35 plays a part in the destinies of Noodles and Max.

Powell informed them that Livesay had gotten bigger through careful use of camera angles, shaving his hair to make his head appear larger and judicious use of padding.

That was when Schrader knew he had found the hook for the screenplay."", u""The boxing scenes amount to barely 10 minutes of the film's running time."", u""Cathy Moriarty's film debut."", u'While preparing to play Jake LaMotta, Robert De Niro actually met with La Motta and became very well acquainted with him. They spent the entire shoot together so De Niro could portray his character accurately. La Motta said that De Niro has the ability to be a contender, and that he would have been happy to be his manager and trainer.', u'According to Martin Scorsese on the DVD, when first screening some test 8mm footage of Robert De Niro sparring in a ring, he felt that something was off about the image. Michael Powell, who at that time had become something of a mentor and good friend to Scorsese, suggested that it was the color of the gloves that was throwing them off. Realizing this was true, Scorsese then decided the movie had to be filmed in black and white.', u""Mardik Martin wrote the most traditional, linear script for the film (more of a traditional Jake LaMotta biography), but backed off on the project due to exhaustion after months of research. Paul Schrader made several changes to the script, including making, Joey La Motta, Jake's brother, the second most prominent character (by combining his actions with that of Jake's friend, Peter Savage) and starting the story in the middle of La Motta's career rather than at the beginning. Although they kept Schrader's overall structure, Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro spent 5 weeks rewriting his version of the script until they had exactly the film they wanted (Scorsese and De Niro are uncredited as screenwriters for the film)."", u'Meeting resistance from United Artists about making a boxing film with a dark anti-hero, producers Irwin Winkler and Robert Chartoff refused to tolerate making Rocky II (1979) until Raging Bull (1980) was approved.', u""Jodie Foster didn't audition for Raging Bull. Producers didn't find her suitable for the character of Vickie and considered her as too young and tomboyish. Despite that she still wanted to get the role. Most likely because of her admiration for Robert De Niro and Martin Scorsese's work. Her mom thought about a way to convince the producers that Jodie was no longer the girl from Freaky Friday (1976) or Taxi Driver (1976) anymore but a young woman. The result was a session with photographer Emilio Lari at a rented estate in Los Angeles in the Summer of 1978 when Jodie Foster was fifteen years old. The pictures taken here later found their (unauthorized) way to adult magazines during the John Hinckley aftermath."", u'Neither Director of Photography Michael Chapman nor Martin Scorsese could get the right look for the amateur LaMotta home movies that comprise the only color sequences in ""Raging Bull"". Both men gave in to their natural instincts for camera placement and framing, which was the antithesis of what they wanted to achieve. They solved the problem by asking Teamsters working on the set to handle the camera in order to give the 16mm film the appropriate feel of amateur home movies.', u""The rooftop wedding scene was directed by Martin Scorsese's father Charles Scorsese after he fell ill while filming."", u'It was based on the strength of their performances in the low budget The Death Collector (1976) that Martin Scorsese decided to cast Joe Pesci and Frank Vincent.', u""According to producer Irwin Winkler, he and Robert De Niro didn't have many creative disagreements on the film, save for when De Niro wanted to gain the weight to look like the older Jake LaMotta. Winkler, fearing for the actor's health, had objected and suggested the use of prosthetics and makeup as they had money in the budget. But as a method actor who wanted to stay true to the real life subject, De Niro opted to gain the weight required."", u""This marked the first time since his first film Who's That Knocking at My Door (1967) that Martin Scorsese was able to work with his film school friend Thelma Schoonmaker due to her having been denied membership in the then all-male Motion Picture Editors Guild."", u'Although only a few minutes of boxing appear in the movie, they were so precisely choreographed that they took six weeks to film.', u""According to DP Michael Chapman, the actual fight scenes were filmed at the normal 24fps rate. For scenes where Jake retires to his corner between rounds, Chapman gradually overcranked his camera by 'ear' from 24fps up to 48fps as Jake walked away (simultaneously adjusting the diaphragm to maintain exposure consistency), and then reversed procedure as Jake emerged from his corner to resume fighting - all in one shot. For the scene where Jake is doused with water in his corner, Chapman overcranked anywhere from 96fps to 120fps."", u""United Artists were unable to actively promote Raging Bull (1980) for awards consideration as it was then embroiled in serious financial trouble following the Heaven's Gate (1980) debacle."", u'Of all the great dramatic films in history, it was the great Buster Keaton\'s comedy Battling Butler (1926) that was one of Martin Scorsese\'s biggest inspirations in getting the ""feel"" of the boxing scenes just right, particularly (and most likely) from Keaton\'s surprisingly realistic, climactic fight. As quoted in the book ""Martin Scorsese\'s Raging Bull"" edited by Kevin J. Hayes (Cambridge University Press. Copyright 2005), Scorsese called Keaton ""the only person who had the right attitude about boxing in the movies"" for him.', u""Was voted the 4th best film of all time in AFI's 10th anniversary of the 100 Years... 100 Movies series."", u'The On the Waterfront (1954) monologue recited by Robert De Niro as Jake La Motta in this film was originally spoken in its respective film by Marlon Brando. Brando and De Niro are the two actors to have portrayed the Vito Corleone character in The Godfather (1972) and The Godfather: Part II (1974).', u""Jake LaMotta's autobiography, co-written with friend Peter Savage, omitted mention of his brother, as did Mardik Martin's original screenplay. Unhappy with the result, the producers hired Paul Schrader to restructure it, and in the course of doing research on La Motta, the writer came across an article on the relationship between Jake and his brother Joey LaMotta. Schrader incorporated the relationship into the revised screenplay, co-opting the Savage character and creating a composite of the two men in the person of Joey La Motta. That relationship became the central plot theme in the revised screenplay and one of the primary reasons for the film's success."", u""The cross that once hung over Martin Scorsese's parents' bed can be seen hanging over Jake LaMotta and Vicki LaMotta's bed."", u""Martin Scorsese was worried about the On the Waterfront (1954) recitation because he knew he'd be inviting critical comparison between the scene in this film and the original film's scene. Robert De Niro read it in various ways. Scorsese chose the take in which the recitation is extremely flat specifically to mute the comparison, and to suggest that it is simply a recitation and not indicative of how Jake LaMotta felt about his brother."", u'The home movie sequences were in color to make them stand out from the rest of the film. Another reason was the feeling of reality, because at the particular time represented by the home movies, 8mm color home movie cameras were very popular.', u'Martin Scorsese claims that nothing should be read into his using the On the Waterfront (1954) quote. Jake LaMotta, in his declining years, used to appear on stage reciting dialogue from television plays and even reading William Shakespeare. According to Scorsese, he\'d planned to use something from ""Richard III"" (because in the corresponding real-life event LaMotta used it), but director Michael Powell suggested that ""Richard III"" wouldn\'t work in the context of the film because the film in general and LaMotta in particular are inherently American.

The crew had a very difficult time trying to get the elk to look at them, as it was apparently used to various noises; it finally looked at them when someone in the crew yawned. Elk are not native to the east coast.', u""According to the film's cinematographer - Vilmos Zsigmond - the scene where the deer is shot [by Michael (DeNiro)] was filmed by giving the trained deer a sedative; it took half an hour for the drug to take effect; they had fenced off an area limiting the deer's range and two cameras were used."", u'The film takes place in 1967, 1968 and 1975.', u'The Viet Cong Russian roulette scenes were shot in real circumstances, with real rats and mosquitoes, as the three principals were tied up in bamboo cages erected along the River Kwai.', u'Chuck Aspegren was not an actor when he was cast in the movie. He was the foreman at a steel works visited early in pre-production by Robert De Niro and Michael Cimino. They were so impressed with Aspergen that they decided to offer him the role. He was in fact the second person to be cast in the film, after De Niro himself.', u""Meryl Streep was romantically involved with John Cazale during the filming as well as after when he died. Dustin Hoffman was aware of this, it's part of why he had producers cast her as Joanna Kramer in Kramer vs. Kramer (1979), because she would bring a vulnerable woman-in-crisis feeling to the role."", u'The wedding scene at the church took five days to film. An actual priest was cast as the priest.', u""John Cazale's last film."", u'Christopher Walken was originally supposed to receive $17,000 for his role as Nick, but his salary was raised to $25,000 because filming took longer than was originally planned.', u""John Wayne's final public appearance was to present the Best Picture Oscar to The Deer Hunter (1978) at The 51st Annual Academy Awards (1979) (TV). It was not a film Wayne was fond of, since it presented a very different view of the Vietnam War than his own movie, The Green Berets (1968), had a decade earlier."", u'Jeff Bridges was considered for the role of Nick.', u'The deer hunting scene was actually shot in the Cascade Mountains of Washington State. The mountain shown in the background is Mount Shuksan.', u""Each of the six principal male characters in the movie carried a photo in their back pocket of them all together as children so as to enhance the sense of camaraderie amongst them. As well as this, director Michael Cimino had the props department fashion complete Pennsylvania IDs for each of them, complete with driver's licenses, medical cards and various other pieces of paraphernalia, so as to enhance each actor's sense of their character."", u'George Dzundza completely blows the toast line when the group arrives in the mountains the first time. His reaction is legitimate, and a few of the other actors can be seen laughing in response.', u'Pierre Segui, who plays Julien, lost a friend in real life to a game of Russian Roulette.', u'U.S. Steel allowed filming inside its Cleveland mill, including placing the actors around the furnace floor, only after securing a $5 million insurance policy.', u""Robert De Niro was so anxious about the film's controversy that he did not attend the Oscars ceremony. He asked the Academy to sit out the show backstage, but when the Academy refused, De Niro stayed home in New York."", u'Rutanya Alda actually struck her head quite hard on the doorway during the first take while being carried out of the reception hall; this is why the scene includes John Savage warning her in the take which was used.', u'The wedding sequences were filmed in the summer, but were set in the fall. To accomplish a look of fall, leaves were removed from trees and painted orange. They were then reattached to the trees.', u'Cited by Jodie Foster as her favorite film.', u""When the guys are leaving the factory and heading to Welch's Bar, Nick encourages Michael to drive faster. In real life, Christopher Walken has a phobia of going too fast in cars."", u'When movie was being planned during the mid-1970s, Vietnam was still a taboo subject with all major Hollywood studios. It was the English Company EMI (headed by Sir Bernard Delfont) who initially arranged financing. Universal got involved with the picture at a much later stage.', u'As the Oscars drew near, the backlash against the film gathered strength. When the limos pulled up to the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion on April 9, 1979, they were met by demonstrators, mostly from the Los Angeles chapter of Vietnam Veterans Against the War. The demonstrators waved placards covered with slogans that read ""No Oscars for racism"" and ""The Deer Hunter a bloody lie"" and thrust pamphlets berating Deer Hunter into long lines of limousine windows. Deric Washburn, nominated for Best Original Screenplay, claims his limousine was pelted with stones. According to Variety, ""Police and The Deer Hunter protesters clashed in a brief but bloody battle that resulted in 13 arrests.""', u""Roy Scheider was originally cast as Michael Vronsky but withdrew from the production two weeks before the start of filming due to 'creative differences'. Still obligated to Universal, Scheider reprised his role as Brody in Jaws 2 (1978)."", u'While producer Michael Deeley was pleased with the revised script, he was still concerned about being able to sell the film. ""We still had to get millions out of a major studio,"" wrote Deeley, ""as well as convince our markets around the world that they should buy it before it was finished. I needed someone with the calibre of Robert De Niro.""  Hiring De Niro turned out to be a casting coup because he knew nearly every actor in New York. De Niro brought Meryl Streep to the attention of Michael Cimino and Deeley. With Streep came John Cazale. De Niro also accompanied Cimino to scout locations for the steel mill sequence as well as rehearsed with the actors to use the workshops as a bonding process.', u'Jan Scruggs, a Vietnam veteran who became a counselor with the U.S. Department of Labor, thought of the idea of building a National Memorial for Vietnam Veterans after seeing a screening of the film in spring 1979, and he established and operated the memorial fund which paid for it.', u'The cast and crew slept on the floor of the warehouse where the Saigon Russian roulette sequences were shot.', u'Michael Cimino spent six months shooting his film, and a further five months mixing the soundtrack. Since this was his first Dolby Stereo film, he was eager to exploit the technology to its fullest potential. A short battle sequence, for example, (200 feet of film) took five days to dub. For the re-creation of the American evacuation of Saigon, he accompanied composer Stanley Myers to the location and had him listen to the sounds of vehicles, tanks, and jeep horns as the sequence was being filmed. Myers then composed music for the sequence in the same key as the horns, so that it would blend with the images creating one truly bleak experience.', u'One of very few films whose 70mm prints kept the film in its original 2.35:1 aspect ratio (letterboxed within the 70mm 2.20:1 frame), instead of simply being cropped to 2.20:1, as was done with most widescreen films blown up to 70mm.', u'When Christopher Walken did the Russian roulette scene, he was remembering being sent to summer camp by his parents, which he hated. He felt betrayed, ostracised, alone - which he felt the character was experiencing at that point in the film.', u'The church used in the wedding sequence was the Theodosius Russian Orthodox Cathedral located in Cleveland, Ohio. One can clearly see the name plaque in one scene.', u'The car that Mike is driving is 1959 Cadillac Series 62.', u'At The Academy Awards, Michael Deeley made a deal with fellow producer David Puttnam, whose film Midnight Express (1978) was nominated, that each would take $500 to the ceremony so if one of them won, the winner would give the loser the $500 to ""drown his sorrows in style.""', u'First feature film depicting the U.S. involvement in Vietnam to be filmed on location in Thailand.', u'Michael Cimino originally wanted Brad Dourif to play the role of Steven.', u'CBS paid $5 million for the exclusive network television broadcast rights for the film. The network (along with NBC and ABC) later backed out when the content was deemed inappropriate. The film made its television debut on election night, 1980, but not on any major network.', u'The film cast includes three Oscar winners: Robert De Niro, Christopher Walken and Meryl Streep.', u'Michael Cimino originally claimed that the wedding scene would take up 21 minutes of screen time. In the end, it took 51 minutes. Michael Deeley believes that Cimino always planned to make this prologue last for an hour, and ""the plan was to be advanced by stealth rather than straight dealing.""', u'Michael Cimino was criticised for one-sidedly portraying all the North Vietnamese as sadistic racists and killers. Cimino countered that his film was not political, polemical, literally accurate, or posturing for any particular point of view. He further defended his position by saying that he had news clippings from Singapore that confirm Russian roulette was used during the war (without specifying which article).', u'The cast and crew viewed large amounts of news footage from the war to ensure authenticity.', u'According to producer Michael Deeley, orchestrated lobbying against the film was led by Warren Beatty, whose own picture Heaven Can Wait (1978) had multiple Oscar nominations. Beatty also used ex-girlfriends in his campaign: Julie Christie, serving on the jury at the Berlin Film Festival where the film was screened, joined the walkout of the film by the Russian jury members. Jane Fonda also criticized the film in public. Deeley suggested that her criticisms partly stemmed from the competition between her film Coming Home (1978) vying with this for Best Picture. According to Deeley, he planted a friend of his in the Oscar press area behind the stage to ask Fonda if she had seen the film. Fonda replied she had not seen the film, and to this day she still has not. Backstage at the Academy Awards she told Michael Cimino that his movie was the ""racist Pentagon version of the war"" .', u'Michael Cimino frequently referred to the film as a ""personal"" and ""autobiographical"" film, although later investigation by journalists like Tom Buckley of Harper\'s revealed inaccuracies in Cimino\'s accounts and reported background.', u'In 2007, the American Film Institute ranked this as the #53 Greatest Movie of All Time.', u'The choir featured in the wedding scenes was the actual choir at the church used during filming. They had to sing the hymns more than 50 times.', u'Scouts for the film traveled over 100,000 miles by plane, bus, and car to find locations for filming.', u'The bar was specially constructed in an empty storefront in Mingo Junction, Ohio for $25,000; it later became an actual saloon for local steel mill workers.', u'The production manager asked each of the Russian immigrant extras to bring to the location a gift-wrapped box to double for wedding presents. The manager figured if the extras did this, not only would the production save time and money, but the gifts would also look more authentic. Once the unit wrapped and the extras disappeared, the crew discovered to their amusement that the boxes weren\'t empty but filled with real presents, from china to silverware. ""Who got to keep all these wonderful offerings,"" wrote Michael Deeley ""is a mystery I never quite fathomed.""', u'According to Christopher Walken, the historical context wasn\'t paramount: ""In the making of it, I don\'t remember anyone ever mentioning Vietnam!"" Robert De Niro added to this sentiment: ""Whether [the film\'s vision of the war] actually happened or not, it\'s something you could imagine very easily happening. Maybe it did. I don\'t know. All\'s fair in love and war."" Producer Barry Spikings, while proud of the film, regrets the way the Vietnamese were portrayed. ""I don\'t think any of us meant it to be exploitive,"" Spikings said. ""But I think we were ... ignorant. I can\'t think of a better word for it. I didn\'t realize how badly we\'d behaved to the Vietnamese people ...""Michael Deeley, on the other hand, was quick to defend Michael Cimino\'s comments on the nature and motives of the film: ""The Deer Hunter (1978) wasn\'t really \'about\' Vietnam. It was something very different. It wasn\'t about drugs or the collapse of the morale of the soldiers. It was about how individuals respond to pressure: different men reacting quite differently. The film was about three steel workers in extraordinary circumstances. Apocalypse Now (1979) is surreal. The Deer Hunter (1978) is a parable ... Men who fight and lose an unworthy war face some obvious and unpalatable choices. They can blame their leaders.. or they can blame themselves. Self-blame has been a great burden for many war veterans. So how does a soldier come to terms with his defeat and yet still retain his self-respect? One way is to present the conquering enemy as so inhuman, and the battle between the good guys (us) and the bad guys (them) so uneven, as to render defeat irrelevant. Inhumanity was the theme of The Deer Hunter (1978)\'s portrayal of the North Vietnamese prison guards forcing American POWs to play Russian roulette. The audience\'s sympathy with prisoners who (quite understandably) cracked thus completes the chain. Accordingly, some veterans who suffered in that war found the Russian roulette a valid allegory.""', u'The first deer to be shot was depicted in a ""gruesome close-up"", although he was hit with a tranquilizer dart.', u'According to Deric Washburn, he and Michael Cimino spent three days together in L.A. at the Sunset Marquis, hammering out the plot. The script eventually went through several drafts, evolving into a story with three distinct acts. Washburn did not interview any veterans to write the script nor do any research. ""I had a month, that was it,"" he explains. ""The clock was ticking. Write the fucking script! But all I had to do was watch TV. Those combat cameramen in Vietnam were out there in the field with the guys. I mean, they had stuff that you wouldn\'t dream of seeing about Iraq."" When Washburn was finished, he says, Cimino and Joann Carelli, an associate producer on the film, took him to dinner at a cheap restaurant off the Sunset Strip. He recalls, ""We finished, and Joann looks at me across the table, and she says, \'Well, Deric, it\'s fuck-off time.\' I was fired. It was a classic case: you get a dummy, get him to write the goddamn thing, tell him to go fuck himself, put your name on the thing, and he\'ll go away. I was so tired, I didn\'t care. I\'d been working 20 hours a day for a month. I got on the plane the next day, and I went back to Manhattan and my carpenter job.""', u'According to Michael Cimino, he would call Deric Washburn while on the road scouting for locations and feed him notes on dialogue and story. Upon reviewing Washburn\'s draft, Cimino said, ""I came back, and read it and I just could not believe what I read. It was like it was written by somebody who was ... mentally deranged."" Cimino confronted Washburn at the Sunset Marquis in LA about the draft, and Washburn supposedly replied that he couldn\'t take the pressure and had to go home. Cimino then fired Washburn. Cimino later claimed to have written the entire screenplay himself. Washburn\'s response to Cimino\'s comments were, ""It\'s all nonsense. It\'s lies. I didn\'t have a single drink the entire time I was working on the script.""', u""Before the beginning of principal photography began, Michael Deeley had a meeting with the film's appointed line producer Robert E. Relyea. Deeley hired Relyea after meeting him on the set of Bullitt (1968) and was impressed with his experience. However, Relyea told Deeley that he would not be able to be the producer on Deer Hunter, and refused to disclose the reasons why. Deeley suspected that Relyea sensed in Michael Cimino something that would have made production difficult. As a result, Cimino was acting without day-to-day supervision of a producer."", u'The film\'s screenplay, by Michael Cimino and Deric Washburn, was based, in part, on the script ""The Man Who Came to Play"", a 1975 screenplay by Louis Garfinkle and Quinn K. Redeker about men who travel to Las Vegas to play Russian Roulette. A pre-release arbitration dispute secured Garfinkle and Redeker a co-""story by"" credit on the film, although the two writers had nothing to do with its making. They also later shared an Oscar nomination with Cimino and Washburn.', u'Robert De Niro spotted Meryl Streep in her stage production of The Cherry Orchard and had suggested that she play Linda.', u'The third film, after Hi, Mom! (1970) and Taxi Driver (1976), in which Robert De Niro plays a Vietnam Veteran.', u'Although the famous deer hunting scene was supposed to take place in western Pennsylvania, it was shot at Mt. Baker, in Washington state.', u'Film editor Peter Zinner was given 600,000 feet of printed film to edit, a monumental task at the time. Zinner eventually cut the film down to 18,000 feet. Michael Cimino later fired Zinner when he discovered that Zinner was editing down the wedding scenes. Zinner eventually won Best Editing Oscar for the film. Regarding the clashes between him and Cimino, Zinner stated: ""Michael Cimino and I had our differences at the end, but he kissed me when we both got Academy Awards."" Cimino later commented in The New York Observer, ""[Zinner] was a moron ... I cut Deer Hunter myself.""', u'Composer Stanley Myers originally wrote ""Cavatina"" for the film The Walking Stick (1970) (which became the theme music for The Deer Hunter) as a much shorter piece for the piano. Classical guitarist John Williams persuaded him to to expand it and rewrite it for the guitar. Williams\' recording of the piece was later used for the film. Cleo Laine has also recorded a vocal version, ""He Was Beautiful"", accompanied by Williams.', u'As told in the documentary, _An Unlikely Weapon: The Eddie Adams Story (2008)_, Michael Cimino carried Eddie Adams\' world famous photo, ""The Execution of a Vietcong Guerrilla"" in his back pocket for a year and credits the iconic image for inspiring the screenplay.', u'The Clairton scenes comprise footage shot in eight different towns in four states: West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Washington, and Ohio.', u'This was Michael Cimino\'s first film to use Dolby noise-reduction system. ""What Dolby does,"" replied Cimino, ""is to give you the ability to create a density of detail of sound-a richness so you can demolish the wall separating the viewer from the film. You can come close to demolishing the screen.""', u'Several critics commented on how the film was the more Republican/apologist version of Vietnam while Coming Home (1978) was the Democrat/protest movement\'s riposte. Pauline Kael criticised the movie for having a racist anti Vietcong feeling to it. ""It\'s as if the Americans are portrayed as doing what they had to do over there, but the Vietnamese are portrayed as vicious sadists, getting off on their ritualistic torture and suicides"".', u'In the USA, theatrical posters contained the following warning at the bottom: ""Warning: Due to the mature nature of this film, under 17 requires accompanying Parent or Adult guardian. (There will be strict adherence to this policy)""', u'G\xe9rard Depardieu was considered for the role of Julien.', u'This movie is considered widely to blame for the introduction of Russian Roulette to pop culture.', u'Michael Cimino worked for six weeks with Deric Washburn on the script. Cimino and Washburn had previously collaborated with Steven Bochco on the screenplay for Silent Running (1972). According to producer Barry Spikings, Cimino said he wanted to work again with Washburn. According to Michael Deeley, he only heard from office rumour that Washburn was contracted by Cimino to work on the script. ""Whether Cimino hired Washburn as his sub-contractor or as a co-writer was constantly being obfuscated,"" wrote Deeley, ""and there were some harsh words between them later on, or so I was told.""', u""The film took five months to mix the soundtrack. One short battle sequence-200 feet of film in the final cut-took five days to dub. Another sequence recreated the 1975 American evacuation of Saigon; Michael Cimino brought the film's composer, Stanley Myers, out to the location to listen to the auto, tank, and jeep horns as the sequence was being photographed. The result, according to Cimino: Myers composed the music for that scene in the same key as the horn sounds, so the music and the sound effects would blend with the images to create one jarring, desolate experience."", u'Bill Clinton later told Meryl Streep that Linda was one of his favorite performances of her entire career.', u""Both John Cazale & Robert De Niro played members of the Corleone family in The Godfather: Part II (1974) although they had no scenes together.

John Savage appeared in The Godfather: Part III (1990), as Andrew Hagen, the son of Consigliere Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall)."", u'During the 29th Berlin International Film Festival in 1979, the Soviet delegation expressed its indignation with the film which, in their opinion, insulted the Vietnamese people in numerous scenes. Other socialist states also voiced their solidarity with the ""heroic people of Vietnam"". They protested against the screening of the film and insisted that it violated the statutes of the festival, since it in no way contributed to the ""improvement of mutual understanding between the peoples of the world"". The ensuing domino effect led to the walk-outs of the Cubans, East Germans, Bulgarians, Poles and Czechoslovakians, and two members of the jury resigned in sympathy.', u'This was the first feature film depicting the Vietnam War to be filmed on location in Thailand.', u'The second film in which a character played by John Cazale has problems with a woman on the dance floor.

Michael Deeley believed that this scene was ""the spur that would earn him an Academy Award.""', u'There was some controversy as the actors were too old for their characters.', u'Because Michael Deeley was busy overseeing in the production of Convoy (1978), he hired John Peverall to oversee Michael Cimino\'s shoot. Peverall\'s expertise with budgeting and scheduling made him a natural choice, and Peverall knew enough about the picture to be elevated to producer status. ""John is a straightforward Cornishman who had worked his way up to become a production supervisor,"" wrote Deeley, ""and we employed him as EMI\'s watchman on certain pictures.""', u'Russian Orthodox Cathedral (St Theodosius) is actually located near corner of Thurman Ave and Starkweather Ave, Cleveland, Ohio.', u'One of two Robert De Niro movies to win Best Picture.

He was fired from the AFI, basically friendless, in the midst of a divorce and was rejected by a girlfriend. Squatting in his ex-girlfriend's apartment while she was away for a couple of months, Schrader literally didn't talk to anyone for many weeks, went to porno theaters and developed an obsession with guns. Schrader was working at the time as delivery man for a chain of chicken restaurants. Spending long days alone in his car, he felt--I might as well be a taxi driver. He also shared with Bickle the sense of isolation from being a mid-Westerner in an urban center. Schrader decided to switch the action to New York City only because taxi drivers are far more common there. Schrader's script clicked with both Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro when they read it."", u'Robert De Niro has said that, despite having won an Oscar for The Godfather: Part II (1974), he was still a relatively unfamiliar face and was only actually recognized once while driving a New York cab during his research for this film.', u'The producers were looking for a ""Cybill Shepherd"" type to play the female lead in the film.

Hermann only accepted after reading the script, and then wrote a highly original score using dissonant brass to punctuate the inner emotions of Travis. After the initial scoring sessions, Scorsese called his composer again, insisting that he needed one more musical cue--a sting, a single frightening chord. Hermann called back a studio orchestra who were paid a day\'s work for that one effect. Shortly after that ultimate session, Hermann died at the age of 64. He had begun his film career in Hollywood writing the music for Citizen Kane (1941).', u'Producer Julia Phillips tells in her auto-biography that Cybill Shepherd had a hard time remembering her lines during the coffee-and-pie scene with Robert De Niro. She writes that De Niro in particular was getting fed up with her and that Phillips and editor Marcia Lucas laughed over all the unusable footage they had to work with in the editing room.', u""In Paul Schrader's original screenplay, the characters of Sport, the Mafioso and the hotel clerk were all black.

Phillips further revealed that Scorsese and Shepard had a difficult relationship on set, with the director having to feed the actress line readings to achieve a credible performance.', u'Travis Bickle\'s famous ""You talkin\' to me?"" scene may have been inspired by Robert De Niro\'s training under Stella Adler, who (as an exercise) had her students practice different interpretations of a similar phrase. The legendary acting teacher was surprised to see one of her former students use ""You talkin\' to me?"" as a psychotic mantra. Martin Scorsese was encouraging De Niro just below the camera while shooting the scene, which led to the rest of the ""dialogue"" Bickle has with his mirror.', u'The clash between Martin Scorsese, the MPAA and the executives at Columbia over the violent content of this film has gone into legend. One of the biggest rumors is that, when facing an X rating from the MPAA and having to edit the film, Scorsese stayed up all night drinking with a loaded gun in his hand, preparing to shoot the executive at Columbia the next day. After an entire night of persuasion from his friends, Scorsese decided to mute the colors in the violent climax and subsequently got his R rating. There are many variations on this legend, one saying that Scorsese was actually planning to take his OWN life; another says that he actually brought the gun to Columbia and threatened the executive until the executive relented.', u'Paul Schrader was inspired to write the script after reading the published diary of Arthur Bremer, the man who was convicted of shooting presidential hopeful George Wallace. Eerily, Bremer was 26 years old in 1976 (the year the film was released), the same age as Travis Bickle in the film. And Schrader himself was 26 when he first wrote the screenplay, in 1972.', u'Melanie Griffith was originally offered the role of Iris, but her mother Tippi Hedren made her turn down the offer. She was the first choice to play the part.', u'Robert De Niro has claimed that the ""You talkin\' to me?"" scene was inspired by Bruce Springsteen\'s banter with his audience at a mid-\'70s gig', u""Brian De Palma was also considered to direct but the producers were dragged to a private screening of Mean Streets (1973) (Robert De Niro and Martin Scorsese's previous collaboration) before they told Scorsese he could direct, but only if he got De Niro to play the lead.

Brooks was amused at that fact, given that Schrader didn't understand the campaign manager but did understand Travis Bickle."", u""The cab Travis drove was Checker. They stopped production after 1982 and the last one in New York City was retired in 1999. De Niro's temporary hack number was: 265216.

Herrmann died on Christmas Eve of 1975, just hours after completing the recording sessions for this film, and the movie was dedicated to his memory."", u'Before becoming a star, Robert De Niro thought about writing a screenplay himself. One of the ideas he had was, in the words of biographer Shawn Levy, ""about a lonely man wandering New York City with guns and dreaming of an assassination."" It never went any further than the idea stage, but it was an eerie coincidence when De Niro found Paul Schrader and this film a few years later.', u'The line ""You talking to me?"" was voted as the #10 movie quote by the American Film Institute, and as as the #8 of ""The 100 Greatest Movie Lines"" by Premiere in 2007.', u'Due to a garbage strike, much of the on-screen filth is real.', u""Bernard Herrmann's score is intentionally devoid of strings, giving the overall thrust of the soundtrack more 'muscle'."", u'The restaurant where the cabbies gather to eat was a real-life hangout for taxi drivers called the Belmore Cafeteria at 28th St. and Park Avenue South.

The rest of the main cast and Martin Scorsese also worked for less than normal. Cybill Shepherd took $35,000; the director made $65,000.

That hairpiece is currently at the Museum of Moving Images in Astoria, New York."", u""Director Martin Scorsese's parents (Charles Scorsese and Catherine Scorsese) appear as Iris' parents in the newspaper article hanging on Travis' wall at the end of the movie."", u'Many critics and fans have speculated that Travis Bickle actually dies during the climatic shootout, and the scenes where he recovers, is thanked by Iris\' parents via letter, and talks to Betsy when she happens to ride in his taxi by chance, are either his dying delusions or pure fantasy. Martin Scorsese and Paul Schrader both provided commentary on laserdisc/DVD releases of the film that deny this theory. Scorsese said that the cab ride with Travis and Betsy is a real event, with Travis\'s ambiguous look after she leaves the cab indicating uncertainty over his own thoughts. Schrader\'s comments were that Travis ""is not cured"" after surviving the shootout, and the writer added ""next time, he\'s not going to be a hero"".', u'Washington Post film critic Stephen Hunter speculated that Travis Bickle\'s character wasn\'t a Vietnam War veteran at all, and his behavior could indicate a man so disturbed that he chose a war veteran ""look"" as a way to somehow connect to the post-war society. However, Martin Scorsese has confirmed in interviews that Bickle was definitely a Vietnam veteran: he said that Bickle\'s mental instability tied into the nation\'s feelings after the war ended in 1975, and also that the Mohawk haircut Travis gets before the climatic violent rampage was inspired by soldiers in Vietnam who would have their hair styled that way before major battles.', u'Due to the bloody content of the brothel shootout scene, cinematographer Michael Chapman agreed to desaturate the colors in post-production. This explains why the blood appears to be pink instead of red in that scene. Later, when the DVD was being prepared, Martin Scorsese wanted to replace it with the original shot, with the blood in its original vivid redness, but no print of that original scene could be found, so the DVD still has the muted colors.', u""Despite being criticized for its violence, only four characters die: the armed robber in the corner shop that Travis shoots, the pimp, the Mafioso and the doorman. Some people believe that Travis actually dies in the shootout (and that the final sequences of the movie are a wish-fulfillment in Travis' head) so that would raise the body count to five."", u'When Bickle decides to assassinate Senator Palantine, he cuts his hair into a Mohawk. This detail was suggested by actor Victor Magnotta, a friend of Martin Scorsese\'s who had a small role as a Secret Service agent and who had served in Vietnam. Scorsese later noted, ""Magnotta had talked about certain types of soldiers going into the jungle. They cut their hair in a certain way; looked like a Mohawk ... and you knew that was a special situation, a commando kind of situation, and people gave them wide berths ... we thought it was a good idea.""', u""In this film, Jodie Foster plays a woman held captive by the villain, played by Harvey Keitel. Robert De Niro's actions in this film provoked John Hinckley, who was obsessed with Foster, to try to get her attention by shooting President Ronald Reagan. The opportunity to reverse her role in this film, and also distance herself from Hinkley, is in part what inspired Foster to take the role of the heroine and rescuer in The Silence of the Lambs (1991). Harvey Keitel would play her future mentor in the prequel, Punainen lohik\xe4\xe4rme (2002)."", u'Taking place in an actual apartment, the tracking shot over the murder scene at the end took three months of preparation just because the production team had to cut through the ceiling in order to get it right.', u""Bickle's attempted assassination of Senator Charles Palantine inspired John Hinckley's attempted assassination of US President Ronald Reagan on March 30, 1981. Prior to the crime, Hinckley had been stalking Jodie Foster at Yale Iniversity, due to his obsession with her character Iris in Taxi Driver (1976). In a letter wrote to Foster, he told her that he was going to assassinate the President, so he could impress her. Reagan was shot in the chest and wounded by Hinckley, Jr., who was committed to a psychiatric facility when he was found not guilty by reason of insanity in 1982. He was released on September 10, 2016 after 34 years in confinement."", u'On the Laserdisc audio commentary, Martin Scorsese acknowledged several critics\' interpretation of the film\'s ending as being Bickle\'s dying dream. He admits that the last scene of Bickle glancing at an unseen object implies that Bickle might fall into rage and recklessness in the future, and he is like ""a ticking time bomb."" Paul Schrader confirms this in his commentary on the 30th-anniversary DVD, stating that Travis ""is not cured by the movie\'s end"", and that ""he\'s not going to be a hero next time."" When asked on the website Reddit about the film\'s ending, Schrader said that it was not to be taken as a dream sequence, but that he envisioned it as returning to the beginning of the film-as if the last frame ""could be spliced to the first frame, and the movie started all over again.""', u'Body count: 4.', u'According to James Wan on the special features of Death Sentence (2007), the ending to that film was inspired by the shoot-out of Taxi Driver (1976).']","[u'USA::7 February 1976 (New York City, New York)', u'USA::8 February 1976', u'USA::25 February 1976 (Los Angeles, California)', u'Brazil::22 March 1976', u'France::20 May 1976 (Cannes Film Festival)', u'France::2 June 1976', u'Australia::10 June 1976', u'Netherlands::1 July 1976', u'Belgium::5 August 1976 (Gent)', u'Denmark::16 August 1976', u'UK::19 August 1976', u'Ireland::10 September 1976', u'Uruguay::16 September 1976', u'Japan::18 September 1976', u'Italy::24 September 1976', u'Austria::7 October 1976', u'West Germany::7 October 1976', u'Argentina::28 October 1976', u'Finland::12 November 1976', u'Norway::26 December 1976', u'Spain::10 March 1977', u'Greece::12 March 1977', u'Sweden::12 March 1977', u'Portugal::15 April 1977', u'Hong Kong::12 May 1977', u'Turkey::1 December 1977', u'Poland::3 March 1978', u'Italy::7 May 1981 (re-release)', u'Hungary::8 May 1988', u'South Korea::17 February 1989', u'USA::16 February 1996 (re-release)', u'Australia::4 April 1996 (re-release)', u'France::October 1997 (Montpellier Mediterranean Film Festival)', u'Denmark::23 July 1999 (re-release)', u'Greece::28 July 2000 (re-release)', u'France::10 January 2001 (limited) (re-release)', u'USA::13 December 2002 (Moonlit Matines Film Festival)', u'Sweden::30 January 2004 (re-release)', u'Germany::February 2004 (Berlin International Film Festival)', u'France::10 November 2004 (re-release)', u'Iceland::12 April 2005 (Iceland International Film Festival)', u'UK::14 July 2006 (re-release)', u'France::September 2007 (Deauville Film Festival)', u'South Korea::10 October 2009 (Pusan International Film Festival)', u'USA::19 March 2011 (restored version) (limited)', u'UK::13 May 2011 (re-release)', u'Greece::5 July 2012 (re-release)', u'Portugal::4 April 2013 (re-release) (restored version)', u'France::1 May 2013 (re-release)', u'Argentina::30 October 2014 (re-release)', u'Chile::1 November 2014 (re-release)', u'France::4 November 2015 (re-release) (restored version)', u'USA::21 April 2016 (Tribeca Film Festival)', u'Australia::11 June 2016 (Sydney Film Festival)', u'Chile::24 August 2016 (SANFIC Film Festival)', u'Japan::17 September 2016 (Gokujo Onkyo Film Festival)', u'Portugal::22 September 2016 (re-release) (restored version)', u'France::9 November 2016 (re-release) (restored version)', u'UK::10 February 2017 (re-release)', u'Ireland::10 February 2017 (re-release)', u'Netherlands::6 July 2017 (re-release)']",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Consequently, his character was replaced by Frankie Pentangeli (Michael V. Gazzo), who received an Oscar nomination for the performance.

On Montanaro\'s first day of filming, it rained.', u""The story, written by Chazz Palminteri, is adapted from his autobiographical one-man play. His real name is Calogero Lorenzo Palminteri. Several studios approached him to purchase the film rights, with at least one offering $1 million, but Palminteri refused to sell them unless he could write the screenplay and play the role of Sonny. None of the studios agreed as they wanted to hire another actor.

Sonny then goes on to stress it\'s important not to give his people so little that fear crosses over into hate.
