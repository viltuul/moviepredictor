When asked about the film, they felt that it accurately captured the event but that the soundtrack was louder than the actual bombardment, a comment that greatly amused director Christopher Nolan.', u'After first-hand accounts of the Dunkirk evacuation revealed to Christopher Nolan how young and inexperienced the soldiers were, he decided to cast young and unknown actors for the beach setting.', u'Christopher Nolan, along with his wife Emma Thomas and a friend, made the crossing from England to Dunkirk on a boat, the way the civilians would have done during the Dunkirk Evacuation. Nolan said it took nineteen hours because of the conditions of the sea.', u'Director Christopher Nolan actually rode in the Spitfire shown in the movie in order to get a sense of the aerial feel of the fighter plane; with the purpose being to help him shoot and provide an authentically realistic experience of the dogfights for the audience.', u'In regards to the Battle of Dunkirk\'s importance, director Christopher Nolan stated, ""This is an essential moment in the history of the Second World War. If this evacuation had not been a success, Great Britain would have been obliged to capitulate. And the whole world would have been lost, or would have known a different fate: the Germans would undoubtedly have conquered Europe, the U.S. would not have returned to war. It is a true point of rupture in war and in history of the world. A decisive moment. And the success of the evacuation allowed Churchill to impose the idea of a moral victory, which allowed him to galvanize his troops like civilians and to impose a spirit of resistance while the logic of this sequence should have been that of surrender. Militarily, it is a defeat; on the human plane, it is a colossal victory.""', u""The ticking sounds that serve as a crucial theme on the film's score were recorded by composer Hans Zimmer from one of director Christopher Nolan's own pocket watches. He then put the sounds into synthesizers and altered them in different ways for the soundtrack."", u'Christopher Nolan received a $20 million salary against 20% of the box office gross, the biggest deal for any director along with Peter Jackson, who received the same amount with King Kong (2005).', u'The movie used over fifty boats on the sea, the most that has ever been put on film.', u'The title ""Dunkirk"" is divided into three segmented colours: sky blue, dark blue, and white, referring to the triptych plot of air, sea, and land.', u'Continuing his advocacy for film over digital formats, Christopher Nolan chose to shoot the movie in a combination of 65/70mm IMAX film and Super Panavision 65mm film in order to achieve the maximum possible image quality. Following The Master (2012) and The Hateful Eight (2015), Dunkirk (2017) was the third major motion picture of the 2010s to be primarily shot and shown theatrically in 70mm.', u""This is the third Christopher Nolan film to be written entirely by Nolan himself, with the others being Following (1998) and Inception (2010). Memento (2000) was based on a short story by his brother, Jonathan Nolan. The Dark Knight (2008), The Prestige (2006), The Dark Knight Rises (2012) and Interstellar (2014) were all co-written by Jonathan Nolan. Batman Begins (2005) was co-written by David S. Goyer. Christopher Nolan's only uncredited written film is Insomnia (2002), which Nolan wrote the final draft of script to shoot with."", u""Towards the end of the film, the blind man is played by John Nolan. John Nolan is the uncle of the director, Christopher Nolan, and has appeared in several of his nephew's films."", u'For the creation of this film, director Christopher Nolan focused on the ""realism"" of every aspect, such as putting an IMAX camera on the cockpit and wings of a fully functional Spitfire plane and make cameramen actually float in the water with actors.', u'A modified two-seater Yak-52 was used to portray a Spitfire so that the actor and actual pilot could switch between seats depending on the shot that needed to be made.', u'Christopher Nolan cited silent movies such as Greed (1924), Intolerance: Love\'s Struggle Throughout the Ages (1916), and Sunrise (1927) as inspirations for Dunkirk (2017)\'s crowd scenes, ""I spent a lot of time reviewing the silent films for crowd scenes -- the way extras move, evolve, how the space is staged and how the cameras capture it, the views used."" Nolan also studied A Man Escaped (1956), Pickpocket (1959), Saving Private Ryan (1998) and The Wages of Fear (1953) to dissect the process of creating suspense through details.', u'For the sound design of the film, Christopher Nolan used a Shepard tone, in which ascending notes are subtly cycled to give the impression of a never-ending rise in pitch. Also he wanted to write the script by obeying this principle so that the audience could braid together three story lines and they continually rise in anxiety and tensity. So as one story line is peaking, the other one is still to be built and the third is entering the last phase.', u'When asked why he cast Harry Styles in the film, Christopher Nolan said ""I auditioned literally thousands of young men with different combinations of young men. And he had it.""', u'In an interview, director Christopher Nolan compared the casting of musician Harry Styles to the casting of Heath Ledger as The Joker in The Dark Knight (2008), because people also underestimated him.', u'The French city of Dunkirk wanted parts of the movie to be filmed in the original Dunkirk. As a consequence, the City Hall created a cinema department to promote and organize filming in the city.

Caine appears in an uncredited voice cameo, he's the voice on the radio talking to a Royal Air Force officer early in the film. Nolan confirmed this in an interview with Stephen Whitty of NJ.com."", u'Winston Churchill had only been British Prime Minister for sixteen days when the evacuation began. On 26 May 1940, in response to peace overtures from the German government, Churchill said, ""I would be grateful to get out of our present difficulties on such terms, provided we retained the essentials and the elements of our vital strength, even at the cost of some territory,"" before adding he was willing to give up Malta and Gibraltar and several African colonies to end the war.', u""At 106 minutes, Dunkirk (2017) is Christopher Nolan's shortest film since Following (1998)."", u'Charles Lightoller, the most senior surviving officer of the RMS Titanic, participated in the Dunkirk evacuation with his private motor yacht the Sundowner. The Sundowner has been preserved by the Ramsgate Maritime Museum in England.', u""In the film Dunkirk, Kenneth Branagh plays Cmdr. Bolton, Royal Navy, the Pier Master at Dunkirk. Director Christopher Nolan explained that Bolton's character was a composite of several officers who performed heroically during the evacuation, but mostly Cmdr. James Campbell Clouston. Clouston was born in Montreal on Aug. 31, 1900, and joined the Royal Navy in the midst of the First World War. The Royal Canadian Navy was a fledgling service at the time, and it was not unusual for young Canadians who wanted to serve at sea the join the Royal Navy. Clouston did well as he advanced through the service, qualifying as a gunnery specialist, considered the cream of the navy. In 1937, he became captain of the modern destroyer HMS Isis, which was undergoing refit when Dunkirk broke in late May 1940. Clouston immediately volunteered to help, and he was appointed pier master in the beleaguered port. From all accounts he gave extraordinary service, working around the clock under the most demanding circumstances to evacuate as many soldiers as possible. He stayed until no more could be evacuated but was killed in the English Channel on his way back to England when the vessel he was on was attacked by enemy aircraft. In July 1940, Clouston was awarded a Mention in Despatches, the highest posthumous award for valour after the Victoria Cross."", u'This film marks the fifth collaboration between Cillian Murphy and Christopher Nolan.', u""In the film, many soldiers cursed the Royal Air Force for not protecting them from the Luftwaffe bombers. What is not mentioned at all is that the RAF was already out, attacking the bombers sent to bomb the soldiers on the beaches, and the bombers that did attack were only the ones that got past the fighters. These dogfights occurred more inland from Dunkirk, hence why the soldiers on the beaches didn't see many fighters during the evacuation, and why they thought the RAF had abandoned them."", u'According to director Christopher Nolan, the tension that he feels watching Saving Private Ryan (1998) was not the tension he wanted for Dunkirk (2017).', u'It is the first Christopher Nolan movie to be based on historical events. All of his other movies have either been original scripts, remakes, novel/short story adaptations, or comic book adaptations.', u'Director Christopher Nolan first got the idea of this film in 1992 when sailing to Dunkirk, France with his then-girlfriend/now-wife Emma Thomas.', u'The end credits state that 12 of the original little ships that participated in the Dunkirk evacuation appear in the film, re-enacting their presence in 1940.', u'This film marked the sixth collaboration between director Christopher Nolan and composer Hans Zimmer. They previously worked together on The Dark Knight Trilogy (2005-2012), Inception (2010) and Interstellar (2014). Zimmer received an Oscar nomination for both Inception (2010) and Interstellar (2014).', u'Urk, a small fishing town in The Netherlands, was used as a base of operation for filming on the IJsselmeer.', u""Mr. Dawson's boat is flying a blue ensign flag (because he was a member of a yacht club and/or was retired Royal Navy); most of the other boats are flying the red ensign, which designates a merchant ship."", u'The screenplay was 76 pages long. As a matter of fact, Christopher Nolan firstly intended to make an improvised film so as to just capture what was going on.', u'When Dunkirk (2017) came out in The Netherlands, everyone in the fisher town of Urk (Flevoland) wanted to see the movie, as a part of the film was filmed at the IJsselmeer. However, Urk does not have its own cinema, so to make sure a couple of people in the town could see the movie in their neighborhood, a cinema-truck (some sort of moving cinema with few seats) was set up.', u""Dunkirk (2017) had the widest film release in the 70MM widescreen format in twenty-five years since Ron Howard's Far and Away (1992). The 70MM film prints of Dunkirk (2017) was screened at 125 70MM theaters, surpassing the previous record of 100 theaters by Quentin Tarantino's The Hateful Eight (2015)."", u'Most of DUNKIRK concentrates on survival rather than heroism, but in the last minute or so of the film, composer Hans Zimmer quotes the main melody from ""Nimrod,"" the fifteenth variation from Sir Edward Elgar\'s popular ""Enigma Variations."" ""Nimrod"" is an orchestral/band piece frequently associated with British patriotism. The same piece of music featured alongside Kenneth Branagh in the London 2012 Olympics opening ceremony as he delivered lines from Shakespeare\'s ""The Tempest"".', u'Nolan used huge number of cardboard cut outs of soldiers along with 1000 extras in order to create the illusion of a huge number of men during the evacuation.', u'This is the debut feature film acting roles for both Fionn Whitehead and Harry Styles.', u'Director Christopher Nolan and Warner Bros. reportedly bought a vintage WWII Luftwaffe bomber for use in this movie, at a cost of $5 million.', u'More than seventy percent of Dunkirk (2017) was shot in IMAX.', u""If you look up this location below on google maps, on Dunkirk beach you can see them building the initial alley way that Tommy runs through to get on to the beach.

Because of its top-heaviness, key grip Ryan Monro would stabilize the unit by physically holding it during complex takes.', u'The Halt Order was agreed by Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt, commander of Army Group A, and General G\xfcnther von Kluge, commander of the Fourth Army, at the request of the tank unit commander General Paul von Kleist, who had lost fifty percent of his armored forces and needed time to regroup. After the war Runstedt tried to blame the Halt Order on Adolf Hitler. Rundstedt\'s biographer conceded that this ""does not represent the whole truth"", because the original impetus for a pause came from Kleist and Rundstedt himself.', u'Dunkirk (2017) was filmed in France under the name ""Bodega Bay.""', u'The hospital ship seen prominently at the beginning of the film is played by M/S ""Rogaland,"" a 1929-built Norwegian passenger ship that saw service in World War II and was sunk in 1944. She was later raised and rebuilt, and still functions regularly as a cruise ship based in Stavanger, Norway.', u'Around one thousand extras were used during the shoot.', u'The parallels between the experiences of Mark Rylance\'s small boat and that of ""Sundowner"" (taken to Dunkirk by Commander C.H. Lightoller, DSC, RNR (Retd)) can be read on pages 201-203 of ""Dunkirk"" by A.D.Divine (published in 1945). Lightoller (previously second officer and most senior surviving crew member of RMS Titanic) took as crew his son and a sea scout; he picked up survivors from a returning motor cruiser and took them back to Dunkirk ""giving them the additional pleasure of again facing the hell they had only just left""; his youngest son (lost flying his Blenheim in the first air raid on Wilhelmshaven) had previously given him advice on evasive tactics and he used them to evade an aircraft which gave up its attack after three unsuccessful attempts to fire on Sundowner; and the stoker P.O. assisting disembarkation of 130 men did ask where he had put them. One surprise is that several equally dramatic incidents in this account were not used in the film, so perhaps they were working from a different version of Lightoller\'s story.', u'Two historic fishing boats were used as a background decor. The UK 12 and the UK 114. However, UK does not stand for United Kingdom. It is a Dutch harbor-code for Urk, where much of the filming was done.', u'This is the third collaboration between Tom Hardy and Christopher Nolan after Inception (2010) and The Dark Knight Rises (2012).', u'The movie is said to have had the largest marine unit in film history while filming in sea during production.', u'Christopher Nolan investigated silent films to infuse crowd scenes with suspense by using details only, given the minuscule presence of dialogue in the film.', u""The entire film was made to encompass the snowball effect that had only been used in the third acts of Christopher Nolan's previous films. According to him, by applying the snowball effect, he stripped the film of conventional theatrics to make the entire film to be more than the sum of its parts."", u'Part of the movie was filmed on the closed off inland bay of IJsselmeer in the Netherlands. The first two letters of the name are capitalized because they are treated as a single letter.', u""This was cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema's second collaboration with director Christopher Nolan. The previous was Interstellar (2014)."", u'The film was criticized for not showing Indian soldiers. Four contingents of Indian soldiers fought at Dunkirk, even though Mohandas K.

Internationally, on 232 IMAX screens, the film grossed almost \xa37M with a strong per-screen average of almost \xa330K, and ranks as the third-highest-grossing Imax opening weekend ever in July, both internationally and globally.

That cinema count is higher than for the opening frames of summer blockbusters such as War for the Planet of the Apes (2017), Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017), Despicable Me 3 (2017) and Wonder Woman (2017). Dunkirk has achieved the fourth biggest UK opening of 2017, behind Beauty and the Beast (2017), Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017) and Despicable Me 3 (2017).

These are the same type of goggles worn by Bruce Spence who played The Gyro Captain in The Road Warrior (1981) from the Mad Max films. Hardy played Max Rockatansky in Mad Max: Fury Road (2015).', u'Perhaps a tongue-in-cheek inside joke by the director: early on in the film, a trio of Spitfires overfly the yacht that is the center of one of the three stories. The owner, Mr. Dawson, says something to the effect of: ""The Rolls Royce Merlin engine. The best sound you can hear out there."" The Spitfires were powered by the Merlin. The Bf 109s of that era would have had Daimler-Benz engines. However, the Messerschmitts used in the film were not 1940-era aircraft. They were Hispano\'s, Bf 109s built by Spain under contact in the late 40s and early 50s. Rather than the sleek nose profile of the original Bf 109s, these planes have ""chin"", to accommodate their new engines, which were Rolls Royce Merlins. The inside joke? Regardless of which fighters flew by, the actual actors, not the characters they played, would have heard the sound of Rolls Royce Merlin engines.', u'Andrew Simpson was reportedly in talks for one of the main characters.', u'Dunkirk features the most footage shoot on 65mm IMAX film stock to date, with 79 minutes of the final cut being footage that was shot on said IMAX film stock. This beats out a previous Nolan film, The Dark Knight Rises, which had 72 minutes of its final cut being footage that was shot on said IMAX film stock.', u""In the sequence where the Spitfire ditches into the English Channel, an IMAX camera was strapped into the cockpit to film Jack Lowden's character trying to get out. However, during filming, the plane with the camera still inside sank quicker than predicted. It took so long to retrieve the plane that the IMAX camera housing filled with water, potentially ruining both the very expensive camera and the film inside. Director Christopher Nolan used an old movie technique of keeping the film wet and shipped it back to Los Angeles, and processed the film before it dried out. The take from that film is in the movie."", u'The film is told from three points of view: on the beach with the infantry (including Fionn Whitehead and Harry Styles), the evacuation by the navy (featuring Cillian Murphy and Mark Rylance, showing how civilians came to the rescue) and then in the air (with Tom Hardy engaging in plane combat). Speaking about the narrative structure in Premiere magazine, Christopher Nolan stated: ""For the soldiers who embarked in the conflict, the events took place on different temporalities. On land, some stayed one week stuck on the beach. On the water, the events lasted a maximum day; and if you were flying to Dunkirk, the British spitfires would carry an hour of fuel. To mingle these different versions of history, one had to mix the temporal strata. Hence the complicated structure; even if the story is very simple. Do not repeat it to the studio: it will be my most experimental film.""', u""The clock in the soundtrack doesn't stop ticking during the whole movie; until Alex and Tommy are sitting safely on the train."", u'The Mark Rylance character, Dawson, is closely based on Lightoller, Second Officer of the Titanic, who took his yacht Sundowner to Dunkirk at the age of 66. Like Lightoller he refuses to let the navy crew his boat - ""if anyone takes her it will be me"", and takes one of his sons with him. Like Lightoller, Dawson has lost a son in the RAF (Brian, shot down in a Wellington bomber on the second day of the war) who taught him how to evade air attack. Also like Lightoller he packs the boat so full (four stood in the bathtub), the disembarkation officer couldn\'t believe over 55 men were aboard Sundowner.', u'In researching the Dunkirk true story, History vs Hollywood discovered that while the character Farrier is not directly based on an actual person, his experience most closely resembles that of Alan Christopher ""Al"" Deere, a New Zealand Spitfire pilot. Farrier\'s fictional experience is indeed similar. After shooting down several German planes, he too is forced to crash-land east of Dunkirk, likely on a Belgian beach. Unlike Deere, Farrier is captured in the closing shots. Deere famously got back to England after punching a naval officer in the face when he refused to let the RAF on board. During his combat career Al was shot down nine times, surviving all incidents to then go on to write his autobiography \'Nine Lives\'.', u""Despite the fact that the Germans are shooting at and bombing the allied forces throughout the film, no German troops are actually visible until one of the last shots in the movie, and even then they're out of focus and in shadow."", u'The distinctive sound of planes that bombed the beach is comes from the Junkers Ju-87 Sturzkampfflugzeug ""Stuka"" dive bombers. The sound did not come from its engine nor its propeller, in fact it comes from sirens mounted upon the leading edges of its faired main gear legs, so called Jericho-Trompete (""Jericho trumpet"") which terrorized ground troops and becomes a propaganda of German air power during WWII. The Stuka dive bombers were the only aircraft equipped with such a siren system, but has became a characteristic sound of planes diving down/attacking.', u'Near the end of the film, a Spitfire without fuel is seen shooting down a Stuka dive-bomber. This is historically correct - the Stukas were notoriously easy targets for fighter planes (especially when preparing to dive) and, in the following Battle of Britain, suffered high casualties.', u'The only German soldiers seen in the film are the ones who capture Farrier at the end of the film. They are shown out-of-focus.', u""Among the British Infantry, only Tommy and a few soldiers firing at German planes are shown using their rifles. In both cases, they don't hit anything."", u'Most unusual for a World War II story, the film deals with civilians rescuing military personnel instead of vice versa.', u""Christopher Nolan's fifth movie to feature a character deliver a monologue while a montage of multiple events closes the film.""]","[u'UK::13 July 2017 (London)\n (premiere)', u'Ireland::16 July 2017 (Galway Film Fleadh)', u'Belgium::19 July 2017', u'Finland::19 July 2017', u'France::19 July 2017', u'Norway::19 July 2017', u'Serbia::19 July 2017', u'Sweden::19 July 2017', u'USA::19 July 2017 (limited)', u'Armenia::20 July 2017', u'Australia::20 July 2017', u'Czech Republic::20 July 2017', u'Denmark::20 July 2017', u'Georgia::20 July 2017', u'Hong Kong::20 July 2017', u'Croatia::20 July 2017', u'Hungary::20 July 2017', u'Israel::20 July 2017', u'South Korea::20 July 2017', u'Malaysia::20 July 2017', u'Netherlands::20 July 2017', u'New Zealand::20 July 2017', u'Philippines::20 July 2017', u'Portugal::20 July 2017', u'Russia::20 July 2017', u'Singapore::20 July 2017', u'Ukraine::20 July 2017', u'Bulgaria::21 July 2017', u'Canada::21 July 2017', u'Estonia::21 July 2017', u'Spain::21 July 2017', u'UK::21 July 2017', u'Indonesia::21 July 2017', u'Ireland::21 July 2017', u'India::21 July 2017', u'Cambodia::21 July 2017', u'Lithuania::21 July 2017', u'Poland::21 July 2017', u'Romania::21 July 2017', u'Turkey::21 July 2017', u'Taiwan::21 July 2017', u'USA::21 July 2017', u'Vietnam::21 July 2017', u'United Arab Emirates::27 July 2017', u'Argentina::27 July 2017', u'Brazil::27 July 2017', u'Chile::27 July 2017', u'Colombia::27 July 2017', u'Germany::27 July 2017', u'Kuwait::27 July 2017', u'Mexico::27 July 2017', u'Peru::27 July 2017', u'Uruguay::27 July 2017', u'Greece::24 August 2017', u'Italy::31 August 2017', u'China::1 September 2017', u'Japan::9 September 2017', u'Canada::10 September 2017 (Toronto International Film Festival)']",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

However, her character was later rebooted as human.', u'Marks the fifth theatrical portrayal of Lex Luthor. It is his fourth time as the main antagonist, the most of any supervillain in any franchise. William Stryker is second, with five appearances, twice as the main villain. Catching up is the Joker, with three and two.', u'The invitation to Lex Luthor\'s house sent to Bruce Wayne has the house residing in the state of ""DM"", this is not an abbreviation for any state. The zip code listed on the invitation is 33862, which is for Lake Placid, Florida.', u""Martha Kent is played by Diane Lane, the same last name as Lois Lane, Superman's girlfriend."", u'Batman has a Robin costume that reads: ""The joke\'s on you."" This is a reference to Jason Todd, who served as the second Robin, Batman\'s sidekick, and who was tortured and beaten to death by the Joker. In some story lines, Jason Todd returns as the murderous vigilante, the Red Hood, and in others, he never actually died, but instead suffered endlessly at the hands of the Joker in an attempt to turn him into an heir to the clown prince of crime.', u'In the picture where Wonder Woman is shown to be a ""meta human"" in the LexCorp documents, the man on her right in the picture is Steve Trevor (who will be played by Chris Pine in Wonder Woman (2017)).', u'The Flash appearing from the future, to deliver an ominous message to Bruce Wayne, is a nod to Marv Wolfman\'s ""Crisis On Infinite Earths"" which featured The Flash doing the exact same thing, including disappearing before he could make it clear what exactly he was warning Batman about.', u""During the dream sequence while Bruce waits for the files to decrypt, a giant Omega symbol on the sand and some Parademons helping Superman's soldiers can be seen. Parademons and the Omega symbol are linked to Darkseid, ruler of planet Apokalips, and an archenemy of the Justice League."", u'In the film, Superman apparently dies but at the end his heart is heard beating during his funeral. In ""The Dark Knight Returns"", Batman fakes his own death and Superman is the only one who hears his heart beating.', u'Superman is dead at the end of the movie after killing Doomsday. This is similar to ""The Death of Superman"" ( Superman comics #75, volume 2), published in 1993, in which they both killed each other.', u""At least three of Batman's hand-to-hand takedowns in the warehouse are taken directly from the Batman: Arkham games. One where he bursts through a wall, another when he breaks a thug's arm backwards, and one where he throws a thug's face straight to the ground. Additionally, there are: the batclaw slam, when Batman uses his batclaw to draw an enemy closer to his fist which knocks him (the enemy) down, and the use of devices that destroy the thugs' weapons (a.k.a. the Disruptor)."", u'Joe Morton is shown as the creator of Cyborg, which is the second time he has made a cybernetic organism. The first being in Terminator 2 (1991), where he was cast as Miles Dyson.', u""A couple days after the release of the movie, Warner Brothers released a deleted scene, which included Lex Luthor (Jesse Eisenberg) interacting with Steppenwolf, who is rumored to be the main villain in Justice League (2017). Zack Snyder said that this clip acts as the movie's post-credits scene. This scene is included in the Ultimate Edition version of the film. However, it does not take place after the credits."", u""Although he was only in one short scene, this is Kevin Costner's first sequel of his career."", u'A deleted scene, made available online after the movie was released, depicts Lex talking with an alien creature who wields a Mother Box. As a S.W.A.T. team comes in to arrest Lex, the being disappears, hinting that Lex knows more than he lets on.', u'Gal Gadot has sixteen lines in the film. She is given one or two more lines in the Extended cut.', u'Lex Luthor\'s role in this film is based on his appearance in the comic ""All-Star Superman"", where he is contemptuous of Superman, due to his alien nature.', u""Jason Momoa's portrayal of Aquaman is heavily based on Aquaman's appearance in the comics during the 1990s."", u""Superman's name was mentioned multiple times during the movie, Batman's only once by Perry White (most of the time he's only referred to as The Bat), and Wonder Woman's, despite her prominent role, not even once, only her undercover name is mentioned once as Ms. Prince."", u'In the scene where Diana ""Wonder Woman"" is packing her things, you can see four framed comic books on the bed: Justice League, Action Comics, Detective Comics, and Wonder Woman.', u""When Superman begins to fly into space with Doomsday, the government launches a nuclear missile, which leaves Superman floating in space. The scene with Superman decaying in space after being hit with the nuclear rocket is similar to a sequence from The Dark Knight Returns, from which this film takes ideas. In the graphic novel, Superman is caught in a nuclear explosion from a nuclear warhead, he then absorbs sunlight from plants so that he can regain his powers. This is different from the film, however, as Superman gains strength back from the sun, as the Earth's rotation causes its rays to come into contact with him."", u""A leaked picture of Dick Grayson's grave, in this movie, was posted prior to the film's release."", u'In the final battle, Wonder Woman uses silver bracelets as weapons to attack Doomsday, sending a powerful energy wave. In the DC Comics, they are called Bracelets of Submission, and Wonder Woman is capable of using them to deflect bullets from any automatic fire, project energy blasts and other projectile weaponry and to absorb forces from a long fall.', u""Lex Luthor uses his own blood to resurrect General Zod and turn him into Doomsday. In the DC Comics, a secret laboratory called Project Cadmus uses Luthor's blood to mix it with Superman's DNA in order to replicate Superman after his death by Doomsday, creating Conner Kent, new Superboy."", u'In the original comics, The Justice League was formed when the alien being Starro came to conquer Earth. Here, it appears that Future Batman sends The Flash back in time to warn Bruce about Superman. This is most likely a nod to when Batman sent The Flash back in time to tell everyone that Darkseid had corrupted Superman. This scene could most likely set up either Justice League (2017) or Justice League Part Two.', u'In ""The Dark Knight Returns"", a four issue mini series published in 1986, Batman and Superman fight long after the Justice League is disassembled. In this movie, they fight before the League is even formed.', u""A giant creature emerges through Martha Wayne's grave in Bruce's dream. It resembles Kirk Langstrom the Man-Bat, one of Batman's allies, who first appeared in 1970."", u""The device Silas Stone uses to rebuild his son Victor (a.k.a. Cyborg) is a Mother Box, that in DC Comics can teleport people through Boom Tubes, and it comes from Apokolips, Darkseid's home planet. Mother Box and the Boom Tubes are also used by the people of New Genesis, Apokolips' good version, who, lead by Highfather, try to defeat Darkseid and his evil companions."", u'Doomsday, in this version, is based on anything but his origin in the comics (the ultimate lifeform created by scientists on Krypton), and arguably incorporates elements from the Golden Age Green Lantern villain Solomon Grundy (an undead villain brought back to life).', u'Alfred jokes about the possibility that Bruce Wayne someday turns into the father of a new generation of the Wayne family. In the comic ""Batman: Son of the Demon"", published in 1987, Batman and Talia Al\'Ghul become the parents of Damian Wayne, who eventually became the fifth Robin, the Boy Wonder (following Dick Grayson, Jason Todd, Tim Drake, and Stephanie Brown).', u'There are cameos of The Flash, Aquaman, and Cyborg as ""Meta-Humans"".', u'Gal Gadot improvised the smirk Wonder Woman does as she battles Doomsday in the climax.', u'Alfred only interacts with Bruce Wayne, never encountering any other character.', u'Ben Affleck is the oldest actor to play Bruce Wayne a.k.a. Batman (he was 43). Christian Bale was 30 when he played Wayne for the first time in Batman Begins (2005). Michael Keaton and Adam West were both 38 when they played Wayne in Batman (1989) and Batman (1966), meanwhile Val Kilmer and George Clooney were both 36 in Batman Forever (1995) and Batman & Robin (1997), respectively.', u""During the battle between Batman and Superman, Batman utilizes different weapons in his fight against Superman. Some of these weapons have similarities to weapons from The Dark Knight Returns. The sonic amplifier weapons that deploy when Superman steps on a panel in the ground have similarities to Batman's sonic rifle from the graphic novel. The Kryptonite grenades that Batman fires from his grenade launcher are similar to the Kryptonite arrow that Green Arrow uses against Superman in the book. The two both explode and emit Kryptonite Gas from their cases."", u""At the end of the movie, Lex Luthor's prison uniform sports the prisoner number 16-TK-421. TK-421 is a reference to Star Wars. During the making of this movie and Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens (2015), both Zack Snyder and J.J. Abrams poked friendly fun at each other's respective films. Jon Stewart declined an offer from Abrams to cameo as a stormtrooper but filmed a brief appearance as himself hosting The Daily Show (1996) making jokes about Superman, which was cut from this film's theatrical release (likely because he'd left The Daily Show prior to its release) but included in the extended cut."", u'Superman\'s coffin is black with a silver ""S"" on top. This is a nod to when Superman came back to life in ""Reign of the Supermen!"" and wore a black costume with a silver ""S"" on it.', u'In the end of the movie, written on the tombs are the words ""If you seek his monument, look around you"". This is, famously, the translation of the Latin phrase on architect Christopher Wren\'s tomb at St. Paul Cathedral in London, England. Wren is best known for rebuilding the cathedral, along with most of Central London, after the Great Fire of 1666, so everything people see around them while at the site is, effectively, Wren\'s work.', u'The Russian mercenary that works for Lex Luthor is KG Beast, a villain who appeared in Batman\'s ""Ten Nights of The Beast"" story.', u'When Clark Kent is in the mountains, he encounters the ghost of Jonathan Kent (Kevin Costner). Although it seems to be a vision or hallucination, this experience is based on fact, and is known as Third Man Factor, which occurs in situations of extreme risk or mortal danger where voices, or even presences help to keep a person alive. One of the most common places where Third Man Factor happens, is the top of a mountain.', u'Despite previous cinematic incarnations portrayed by Gene Hackman and Kevin Spacey, where Lex Luthor was shown as a criminal mastermind wanted for justice, Luthor is now head of a complex corporation named LexCorp. This reflects his portrayal in 1987\'s Superman comic reboot, following the limited series ""Crisis on Infinite Earths"" published in 1985 (which restarted all DC Universe), where Lex Luthor is depicted as a powerful and wealthy businessman of his own company LexCorp, who becomes obsessed with defeating Superman. This version of Luthor was also featured in the television series Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman (1993).', u'At the end of the rooftop confrontation between Lex Luthor and Superman, Lex warns Superman of the time left to kill Batman to save his mother, saying ""When you came here you had an hour...now it\'s less."" The extended version of the movie is 2 hours and 54 minutes long, excluding the end credits. Superman actually arrives on the rooftop to confront Lex at 1 hour and 54 minutes into the movie. When he arrived, there was an hour left of the movie.', u'The first live action Batman film to not have Commissioner Gordon as a supporting character.', u'Lois Lane\'s photographer, who turns out to have a listening gadget in his camera, and is then murdered by the terrorists because of this, is not named in the theatrical cut. In the extended version, he is revealed to be Jimmy Olsen, ""Superman\'s pal"" from the old comic books. Zack Snyder explained that in this reinterpretation of Superman\'s world, there isn\'t anything for Jimmy to do, hence the decision was made to eliminate him in a dramatic fashion.', u'When Lois Lane is walking towards Anatoli Knyazev, the song ""Ev\'ry Time We Say Goodbye"" (written by Cole Porter; performed by Mark Jonathan Davis & Lounge Against The Machine) can be heard. The lyric in question is ""Every time we say goodbye, I die a little."" This is a foreshadowing of what Knyazev says to Martha Kent after she has been kidnapped: ""We must say goodbye soon. And every time we say goodbye, you die a little.""', u'In the video clip introducing Cyborg, his father refers to the mysterious shape-changing cube that merges with him as ""Object 61982."" Though he first appeared in DC Comics Presents #26 in October 1980, Cyborg debuted as a Teen Titan in Tales of the New Teen Titans on June 19, 1982.', u'Near the end, a guard addresses Lex Luthor by his prisoner number, AC231940. This is a reference to the first appearance of Lex Luthor in Action Comics #23, published in April of 1940.', u""After Superman's death, the cellular towers form crosses in the background, alluding to the connection of a savior laying down his life, like in the Christian ideology."", u'Although not confirmed, Bruce Wayne\'s nightmare could be interpreted as the DC Extended Universe heading towards an adaptation of the popular fighting game series ""Injustice"". Parallels include Superman being a dictator, Batman leading a resistance force against Superman, a military at Superman\'s whim, and the mention of ""she was my world, and you took her from me"" by Superman, could reference Lois Lane\'s death. This could also be reinforced when the Flash makes his cameo telling Bruce Wayne that ""Lois Lane is the key"" and ""Bruce was right about him"".', u'At the beginning of the movie, the Wayne family is seen walking under a marquee advertising the movie Excalibur (1981). In this movie, King Arthur is killed when Mordred runs him thru with his sword. Arthur then grabs Mordred by the hands and forces the sword deeper inside him so he can get close enough to kill Mordred. This foreshadows the climax of the battle between Superman and Doomsday.', u'According to Batman-News, the suit of armor is outfitted with Kryptonite and packing firepower beyond raw strength (in this case, ""missiles""). The details are claimed to be secondhand from Ben Affleck\'s trainer on the film, Rehan Jalali. That implies these details be taken with a grain of salt, but there has been prior evidence that Zack Snyder would be turning to Kryptonite to help even the playing field, despite keeping it absent from Man of Steel (2013) entirely.', u'In the scene where Lois Lane is in Clark Kent\'s bedroom weeping on his bed after his death, the wallpaper mimics the wallpaper in Hogarth Hughes\' bedroom in ""The Iron Giant"". This may be a tribute by Zack Snyder, since in The Iron Giant (1999), the giant wanted to be like Superman and do good deeds for Earth and its people. In the end of the movie, he sacrifices himself to save the town of Rockland, Maine from the nuclear warhead. In a similar way, Superman sacrifices his life to kill Doomsday, and save Earth.', u""Deborah Snyder, Producer, and wife of Zack Snyder, makes a cameo appearance as a guest at Clark Kent's wake."", u""After Clark's funeral, Lois stays behind and drops a handful of soil onto Clark's casket. In the television series Smallville (2001), Clark Kent (Tom Welling) does the same thing at Jonathan Kent's funeral in season five, Lionel Luthor's funeral in season seven, and the destroyed truck, where Lex Luthor was killed, in season eight."", u""The movie begins and ends with funerals. The beginning is the Waynes' funeral, and the end is Superman/Clark Kent's funeral."", u'This movie reunites Ben Affleck with Diane Lane after Hollywoodland (2006) (a movie with a Superman theme), although they meet for only a few moments in this movie.', u'When Lex Luthor places Zod\'s corpse into the water of Genesis Chamber, he says to Zod: ""You flew too close to the sun"". This is a reference to the Greek myth of Icarus, who used a pair of wings attached to him with wax to escape from the Labyrinth. His father Daedalus warned him not to fly too close to the sun (which would melt the wax) but Icarus ignored him, fell, and drowned in the sea.', u'During the battle between the two heroes, ""MCK"" can be seen on a pillar in graffiti. These are the initials of Superman\'s adoptive Earth mother, Martha Clark Kent, making this a possible premonition to the revelation that ends their fight.', u""This is the second time Michael Cassidy has portrayed a Daily Planet staff member, who has been unceremoniously knocked off by Lex Luthor; in the seventh season of Smallville (2001), Cassidy's character, Grant Gabriel, was revealed to be the clone of Lex's deceased baby brother, Julian, whom Lex murders once he becomes too close to their father, Lionel. Cassidy's Jimmy Olsen is killed in this film, as part of Lex Luthor's machinations to turn public ridicule against Superman."", u'In the comic book ""Death of Superman"", his body is brought to Star Labs, where they take blood and clone not one Superman (Superboy), but five, three being aberrations, not quite mentally right.', u'When Luthor confronts Lois Lane on the helipad, he quotes Vladimir Nabokov\'s novel Lolita, ""Plain Lo in the morning. Lola in slacks."" Jeremy Irons (Alfred Pennyworth) starred as Humbert Humbert in Lolita (1997).', u""This is the first film in 3-D to feature not just Batman, but Wonder Woman, Cyborg, The Flash and Aquaman. Superman's first 3-D film was Superman Returns (2006), and Green Lantern had a 3-D film in Green Lantern (2011), which is not connected to the DC Extended Universe."", u""This is the second time that Jeffrey Dean Morgan played a DC Comic hero's father in a Zack Snyder film. The first was in Watchmen (2009), when he played The Comedian, Silk Spectre II's father."", u'When Bruce Wayne is in his new office building, he gets checks with red writings on them, and newspaper headlines in an envelope with the same red writing on it, haunting Bruce, and with his family not saving their youngest son Lincoln March Wayne after he was presumed dead in Arkham Asylum years ago. Lincoln March Wayne is the head leader of Court of Owls empire.', u'Throughout most of the film, Lex Luthor is seen with longish hair, a direct contrast to his traditional bald headed appearance. However, by the end of the film, Luthor\'s hair had been shaved off, showing him as bald, which plays as a throwback to Gene Hackman with the ""Is it a wig, or is it a bald cap?"" question.', u""In Man of Steel (2013), Zod kills Jor-El by stabbing him in the side. In this film, Doomsday, created using Zod's body, stabs Superman in the side, the same side as his father."", u'In the comic book ""Death of Superman"", Doomsday is killed by Superman during a simultaneous punch. In Smallville (2001), he\'s just put out of commission, as the Justice League from the future sends him to the end of time to fight no one. This way was the safest, as the League knew Doomsday could not be killed.', u'A ""Death of Superman"" adaptation, titled Superman Reborn, was planned in 1993, written by Jonathan Lemkin. The story involved Superman\'s life force going into Lois Lane after he died, causing an immaculate conception. Their child grows to age 21 in three weeks, and becomes the resurrected Superman. Gregory Poirier re-wrote the script, and his version had Brainiac creating Doomsday, and an alien named Cadmus resurrecting Superman to defeat Brainiac.', u'After the nuclear blast, Superman is referred to as ""Projectile 2"". This is a remote reference to ""P.R.O.J.E.C.T. 2"" to All-Star Superman, which is a project dedicated to creating a second superman after Superman\'s death in the comics.', u""The film bares some similarities to the earlier Batman film The Dark Knight (2008): In both films, the main antagonists The Joker and Lex Luthor are both bent on bringing down Harvey Dent and Superman. Both Harvey Dent and Lex Luthor kidnap Superman and Commissioner James Gordon's families to force them into a confrontation. In the aftermath of the final showdown between the protagonists and the antagonists, both The Joker and Lex Luthor are arrested. Both, The Joker and Lex Luthor kill people in explosions.

Christopher Nolan accepted these terms, as long as they did not get in the way of the making of the movie. That did not prevent clashes, though; at one point Thorne spent two weeks talking Nolan out of an idea about travelling faster than light.', u'For a cornfield scene, Christopher Nolan sought to grow five hundred acres of corn, which he learned was feasible from his producing of Man of Steel (2013). The corn was then sold, and actually made a profit.', u""Steven Spielberg, who was attached to direct the film in 2006, and hired Jonathan Nolan to write the screenplay, chose other projects instead.

Matthew McConaughey stars in both films.', u'The wormhole explanation using paper and pen is exactly the same as it appears in Event Horizon (1997).', u'Like Inception (2010) and the last two ""Dark Knight"" films, Christopher Nolan has focused on as many real environments as possible. ""We have spatial interiors. We built closed sets and shot it like a documentary, like the actors were really there,"" he said. Nolan had the film\'s visual effects created in advance, and projected onto screens placed outside the spacecraft set, so when the actors looked out the windows of their vessel they would be able to see and react to a real environment, and not a green screen. Technically, Nolan said he shot with an IMAX camera on this film more than on any of his previous pictures. He also wanted to give greater enhancement to the audio experience this time around. He stated that he has ""very ambitious sound mix plans. I want to give audiences an incredible immersive experience. The technical aspects are going to be more important than any film I\'ve made before.""', u'The majority of shots of the robot TARS were not computer generated. Rather, TARS was a practical puppet controlled and voiced on-set by Bill Irwin, who was then digitally erased from the film.

However, he found the finished effect to be explainable provided that he maintained consistent camera perspectives: ""As long as we didn\'t change the point of view or the camera position too much, we could get something very understandable.""', u'Christopher Nolan cast Matthew McConaughey, after seeing his performance in Mud (2012). It was an ""ideal moment"" for Nolan when they landed a Texas native, McConaughey, for the lead role: ""I\'m thrilled for him right now. I didn\'t know how much potential he had until I saw \'Mud\', not just as a leading man, but in sheer acting talent."" He remarked that in McConaughey he ""needed an everyday man who can experience these extraordinary events.""', u'Dr. Kip Thorne won a scientific bet against Stephen Hawking upon the astrophysics theory that underlies Interstellar (2014).

These key scenes include ""Imperfect Lock"", ""No Time For Caution"" (the docking scene), and varying portions of ""Stay"", ""Mountains"" (the water planet), and ""Detach"".', u""According to Albert Einstein's theory of General Relativity, it would take an infinite amount of time to cross the threshold of a black hole's event horizon, as seen by a distant observer. The person crossing the threshold, however, would notice no change in the flow of time."", u'The apocalyptic Earth setting in this film is inspired by the Dust Bowl disaster that took place in the United States during the Great Depression in the 1930s.', u'When presenting the American Cinematheque award to Matthew McConaughey, Christopher Nolan said, ""I\'m not a believer in the McConaissance . . . I think Matthew\'s success of late is the rest of us catching up to what he\'s been doing . . . "" Jennifer Garner talked about two different films she\'d done with him and explained that he\'d given the same gravity and intensity to both different genres, ""and I can tell you as a director, there\'s no question that this is a performer who can\'t say, \'Pass the salt\' without it being truthful, without meaning something . . . I\'ve never worked with an actor so relentless in his pursuit of truth in everything he does."" Nolan also recalled that while he was presenting the night\'s award to McConnaughey, he remembered how the super-dad would play with Nolan\'s own kids while on set: ""I find him extremely serious. But my kids found him very amusing on his days off when he would build forts with them and his kids, thereby making me look like a slightly worse father.""', u""The film parodies the story that the moon landings were faked by the government. It's used in the movie as an attempt to quell future generations' enthusiasm for space travel. Amazingly, real-life conspiracy theorists claim that Stanley Kubrick directed the television footage of the landings, using leftover props from 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), which itself is one of the inspirations for this film."", u'A copy of Stephen King\'s novel ""The Stand"" is visible among Murph\'s books. King\'s book is about the near extinction of humanity and the survivors\' struggle to relocate and settle down.', u'Starting in 2014, Paramount Pictures began to cease releasing its features on traditional film stock in favor of digital projection formats. However, as Christopher Nolan is a strong proponent for the continued use of film prints over digital, he insisted that this film be additionally released in the 15/70mm IMAX, standard 70mm and 35mm film formats a full two days before its wider digital release.', u'The wormhole shown in this film near Saturn is exactly the same place shown in Man of Steel (2013), produced by Christopher Nolan.

The other five titles are Batman Begins (2005), The Prestige (2006), The Dark Knight (2008), Inception (2010), and The Dark Knight Rises (2012).', u'Christopher Nolan described the film as ""an ode to human spaceflight"" and cited multiple films as influences on the project: Metropolis (1927), 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977), Alien (1979), and Blade Runner (1982) served as influences for the film\'s depiction of science and space travel, while The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948) and The Mirror (1975) influenced the human drama. Nolan also cited the Steven Spielberg films, Jaws (1975) and Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977), as films that manage to tackle serious subject matters, while still appealing to all audiences as examples for him to emulate. Nolan and his crew studied the IMAX documentaries of NASA by Toni Myers, for visual reference of space-faring missions, and sought to mimic the look of her use of IMAX cameras aboard spaceships. Finally, Nolan screened a print of The Right Stuff (1983) for the crew before shooting started, to help them understand their roles in the film.', u'The dismantled robot on the ice planet has the designation KIPP, which is a reference to Executive Producer Dr. Kip Thorne.', u'Given that the film is 169 minutes long, and cost approximately 165 million dollars to make, that works out to about 976,331 dollars per minute.', u'Filmed under the fake name ""Flora\'s Letter,"" after Christopher Nolan\'s daughter Flora Nolan.', u'In a Q&A interview at CinemaCon in Las Vegas on March 26, 2014, Christopher Nolan stated that this film is ""very different"" from his past work and he was inspired by the movies he saw growing up during what he termed ""the golden age of the blockbuster"" - essentially, four quadrant films that didn\'t need a ""family"" label to appeal to all audiences. Nolan noted it\'s ""really about going back to those sort of films.""', u'To get inspiration for real-world space travel, Christopher Nolan invited former astronaut Marsha Ivins to the set.', u'Some of the ""archive footage"" interviews were filmed specifically for the production, and then altered by the visual effects teams to appear much older.', u'The ""hyper-sleep"" chambers place the astronauts\' bodies in a cold liquid, as seen after they wake up, when they are covered in blankets or thermal blankets. This is likely a practical reference to studies that have shown a state of hibernation can be achieved in the human body by causing hypothermia. This technology has been used to treat brain damage, and has been proposed as a viable means of keeping people with severe injuries alive after accidents, while they are transported to medical facilities, where they can be treated by specialists.', u""This is Christopher Nolan's seventh film to be included in the IMDb Top 250."", u'The character of Murph was originally a boy in early drafts of the script.', u'The name of the black hole is ""Gargantua,"" who was also a giant with an incredible appetite, very difficult to satisfy. This character was created by Francois Rabelais in his ""Gargantua et Pantagruel"" novels.', u'The logos for Warner Brothers, Paramount Pictures, Syncopy, and Legendary Pictures, at the beginning of the film, all have a ""dusty"" treatment given to them, foreshadowing the reason for the film\'s main plot.', u""In Christopher Nolan's opinion, the score composed by Hans Zimmer is the strongest and most powerful one he has created so far."", u'The jacket that Murph (Jessica Chastain) wears throughout the movie, is very similar to the jacket that Coop wears in the beginning--just a little longer, and with patch, rather than welt, pockets.', u'Hoyte Van Hoytema retooled an IMAX camera to be handheld for shooting interior scenes.', u'This is the fifth collaboration between Hans Zimmer and Christopher Nolan.', u'The school where Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) goes to the parent-teacher conference is called ""Longview School"" and is an actual school in Longview, Alberta, Canada, where the scene was filmed. Coincidentally, McConaughey graduated from Longview High School in Longview, Texas.', u""This was Christopher Nolan's first film since Memento (2000) to not be filmed by Cinematographer Wally Pfister, who was busy with his directorial debut Transcendence (2014). Nolan hired Cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema to replace Pfister."", u'The film has six Oscar winners in the cast: Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Sir Michael Caine, Ellen Burstyn, Casey Affleck, and Matt Damon. It also includes two Oscar nominees: Jessica Chastain and John Lithgow.', u""The film began as a Paramount Pictures production. When Christopher Nolan took the director's chair, Warner Brothers, which had released Nolan's recent productions, sought a stake in the project. In exchange for international distribution rights, Warner Brothers gave Paramount Pictures the rights to co-finance future sequels of Friday the 13th (2009) and South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut (1999)."", u'With a running time of 2 hours, 47 minutes, and 7 seconds, it is the longest IMAX movie ever released as of 2014.', u'In the office of NASA\'s secret base, you can catch a glimpse of the lithographs of ""From the Earth to the Moon"" by Jules Verne.', u'Besides Saturn\'s connection to crops, he was also known as Kronos, the god of time (""chronos"") and cycles (thus the eponymous chronology, chronicle, et cetera.). Since time is a key theme in the movie, the appearance of the wormhole next to the planet Saturn is highly significant.', u'The ""Miller Planet"" scene was filmed in Iceland.', u'The documentary-style interviews of older survivors, shown at the beginning of the film, and again on the television playing in the farmhouse, towards the end of the movie, are from Ken Burns The Dust Bowl (2012). They are real survivors, not actors, of that natural disaster.', u'Dr. Kip Thorne also collaborated with game developer Sticky Studios on the official mobile and web game by providing paper excerpts and equations. The entire game is scientifically correct in respect to time dilation, gravity, and energy.', u'The visual effects that portray the wormhole with stars stretching out on its horizon is known in astrophysics as ""Gravitational Lensing,"" That is, in fact, how astronomers have identified black holes (an intense gravitational field bending space so much, that light coming from stars behind it is stretched out around the sphere of the black hole\'s ""event horizon""). Considering the high-degree of scientific accuracy of this film, it\'s not inconceivable that a wormhole would look much in real-life, as it is portrayed on this movie.', u'The TARS robot, when standing upright, strongly resembled a much smaller version of the monolith in 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968).', u""Christopher Nolan's fourth straight film to be named one of AFI's Top Ten Movies of the Year."", u'The building designs are inspired by the works of modernist architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe.', u'The books displayed on the book shelves shown in this film, were the actual books Nolan had read, and used, for his research about black holes and singularity.', u'The 70mm IMAX version is two minutes shorter than the regular 70mm, Digital IMAX, 35mm, and digital projection versions. This is because the end credits are played in an abbreviated slide-show form (rather than scrolling from bottom to top), due to the size capacity of the IMAX platters, which can hold a maximum of 167 minutes of film.', u""A.

While not explicitly referenced, the Dark Knight trilogy directed by Christopher Nolan features a character, known as Ra\'s Al Ghul, who, in the Batman comics cheated death numerous times, thanks to the magic and science of the ""Lazarus Pit."" The trilogy, and this film, share common themes, such as rebirth and beginning new lives, and they also involve end-of-the-world types of scenarios (although in the Batman films, it would be on a smaller scale in the beginning, at least).', u'Matthew McConaughey appears in this film opposite Matt Damon and Jessica Chastain, both of whom would appear together the next year in The Martian (2015).

As the scene cuts to Professor Brand, you can see the same thing on a different pillar on the left. This word continues to be obvious throughout the entire scene.

Franklin and his team at Double Negative. Thorne provided pages of deeply sourced theoretical equations to the team, which then created new CGI software programs based on these equations to create accurate computer simulations of these phenomena. Some individual frames took up to one hundred hours to render, and ultimately the whole CGI program reached to eight hundred terabytes of data.

The first known reference to the term in science fiction literature occurred in Robert A. Heinlein\'s 1941 short story ""And He Built a Crooked House."" In the story, an architect designs a house based upon the geometric concept of a four-dimensional analogue of the cube. He does this so well, that the house folds in upon itself and creates a dimensional loop within the structure.

Assuming a mission were to be dispatched from Cooper Station orbiting Saturn, it would take only nine hours in relative time for Doyle to be rescued, but 65+ years would have passed for the rest of the world (assuming a dilation factor of one hour per seven years)."", u'The very first line in the movie, spoken by Coop\'s daughter Murph is as follows: ""I thought you were the ghost.""

Coined by Charles Howard Hinton in 1888 in his book ""A New Era of Thought,"" the tesseract is a structure that extends a normal cube into four dimensions. It was popularized in Robert A. Heinlein\'s short story ""--And He Built a Crooked House"" from 1941, and later in the 1962 science fiction novel ""A Wrinkle In Time"" by Madeleine L\'Engle.', u""Many of the characters' names are found on the books in Murph's room as authors."", u""The escape method from the black hole, using the space ships jointly as thrusting power (and then leaving only one thrusting ship behind for Hathaway's character), resembles the escape method in the movie 2010 (1984) (from one of Jupiter's changing moons)."", u""The original script of the Steven Spielberg version of this film depicts an almost entirely different movie. Some examples include Murph being a boy, no humans are first sent into space (probes are) and a probe leads Cooper to the hidden NASA base, which is on a remote island in California where Brand and Cooper deep-sea dive for parts. Also, the robots are much more human-like, featuring hands and shoulders. TARS is sucked into space early on when the ship gets stuck between two black holes (Gargantua and Pantagruel--two French mythical giants) immediately after entering the wormhole. Afterwards the crew, including an additional member named Roth, only visit the ice planet, where they discover that a Chinese mission had been there some thirty years prior, and seemed to have vanished, until it is learned that they were killed by the radiation of a neutron star. The crew falls through the ice into an entirely different ecosystem with a living rearranging forest and colonial organisms that fight each other every night, compounding into larger organisms to reach a higher spot closer to the ice sky for sunlight in the day. After searching the area, they find an abandoned Chinese camp with an experimental black box that can control gravity nearly at will, and are then discovered by Chinese robots who sabotage their return home with the box. The crew orbits a black hole (lasting hundreds of Earth years) before entering a second wormhole where they interact directly with the fifth dimension bulk beings who lead them to a four thousand-year-old space station built by the Chinese that's only a few hundred years old, due to space-time relativity, powered by a captured mini black hole that views galaxies as flat, lines of light. The Chinese have built thousands of worm holes, and tried to travel back in time with the gravity technology to save all of Earth, but died in the process. Cooper returns to Earth, in the year 2230, to find a barren land with ice storms. He sits down prepared to die in the storm, then awakens in a manner similar to the movie, where he meets his great-great-grandson, rather than an aged Murph. After being bored with the current world, Cooper steals a ship to find Brand (the two had been intimate before Brand parted Cooper, to continue to explore space rather than return to Earth)."", u'When the TARS robot and Romily are repairing the KIPP robot on Dr. Mann\'s planet, TARS warns, ""get back, professor, get back!"" Right before KIPP detonates, you can faintly hear it say, ""please don\'t make me . . . "" Light is shed on what this means, in Christopher Nolan\'s since-released comic ""Absolute Zero,"" an account of Dr. Mann\'s and KIPP\'s survey of the planet.', u'One of the books visible on Murph\'s shelf is David Wroblewski\'s ""The Story of Edgar Sawtelle"". This book hints at key plot points, where the title character, who also lives on a farm, is aided in solving a mystery through the help of his deceased father\'s ghost.', u""The first Christopher Nolan film where Sir Michael Caine's character dies."", u'When Cooper exits the wormhole back to Earth\'s solar system, the scene resembles the ""star child"" scene from Stanley Kubrick\'s 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), which is referenced several times in this film.', u'The tesseract scene (which looks like a giant library, and allows Cooper to access his daughter\'s bookshelf in the past) bears some resemblance to the concept of L-space as described in Terry Pratchett\'s ""Discworld"" books. L-space (short for Library space) is the principle that the mass of information contained in a large collection of books warps space and time, and in consequence a sufficiently large library allows the visitor to access any library anywhere in space and time.', u""Cooper and Donald sit on their porch before Cooper's departure drinking what appears to be beer, despite the fact that all crops except for corn (including ostensibly hops and barley, ingredients in beer) are not able to be grown."", u""In spite of TARS' humorous line about never leaving Dr. Brand behind, that's exactly what happens near the end when he is jettisoned into the black hole, Gargantua."", u'When inside the tesseract, during the black hole sequence, one of the books on the bookshelf is James Ellroy\'s ""The Big Nowhere"" - clearly an allusion to where Cooper is at that moment.', u'The scene near the end, when Cooper travels out of the tesseract, back through the wormhole, and touches Brand\'s hand resembles Michelangelo\'s ""Creation of Adam"" painting in the Sistine Chapel.', u'In the scene where Cooper has to land their ship on Miller\'s water planet, the camera focuses on him gripping the seat of his chair. This is a reference to a common aviation saying, ""Fly by the seat of your pants."" Before modern instruments, pilots relied on instinct and their senses to fly, such as sight, using landmarks to gauge altitude or distance. Pilots also used feeling from the vibrations in their seat from air hitting the plane to determine windspeed and direction. Cooper verifies this when he said he needs to ""feel the air"" in order to land properly instead of relying on technology.', u""On-screen body count: Four. Several characters also die off-screen by the end of the film: Donald, Romily, Jesse (Tom's firstborn son, possibly from dust-related respiratory problems), and most likely Tom, as he is never mentioned, nor seen during Cooper's time on the space station, at the end of the film."", u'Toward the end of the movie, when Cooper is walking toward the copy of his house on the space station, a series of screens on his path depict people narrating their past experiences on Earth. On the very last screen, for an instance, you can see someone who looks vaguely like Arthur C. Clarke, the writer of 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968). This is not actually Clarke, and is in fact one of the people featured from the The Dust Bowl (2012) footage, possibly selected because of the resemblance.', u'The spaceship near the end of the film resembles the spaceship in the Arthur C. Clarke novel ""Rendezvous with Rama"", a fifty kilometer (thirty-one mile) cylindrical alien spaceship, that can also carry a human colony to the stars.', u'Dr. Mann emphasizes to Cooper, that before he dies, he will see his children, foreshadowing his actual reunion with Murph.', u'The first of two movies in which Matt Damon has played a stranded astronaut stuck on another planet, the other being The Martian (2015).', u""In Timestalkers (1987), an historian researches clues of time travel in the past (from a remote, plausible future) which leads him to a top-secret military base and hangar. The plot device is similar (although it's a former pilot and, later, his astrophysicist daughter) to this film. William Devane acted in both films."", u'While Coop takes down time at (the orbital replica of) his homestead, the surroundings are curved upwards in M\xf6bius-like angles. Elysium (2013) - which also starred Matt Damon - had a similar, human settlement apart from Earth.', u""Casey Affleck and Matt Damon previously co-starred in the films Chasing Amy (1997), Good Will Hunting (1997), Gerry (2002), as well as the Ocean's trilogy."", u""The film's main villain, Dr. Mann, played by Matt Damon, is the only villain created by Nolan who is not part of the film's main conflict."", u'When Cooper wakes Dr. Mann, he says, ""You literally raised me from dead,"" to which Cooper replies, ""Lazarus."" The ""Lazarus Pit"" was a major location in The Dark Knight Rises (2012), a film directed by Christopher Nolan.', u'When Cooper tries docking onto the spinning Endurance, CASE tell him ""this is no time for caution."" Consequently, the score Hans Zimmer titled for this scene is called ""No Time for Caution.""', u'When Dr. Mann fails to dock perfectly, and the Endurance explodes, the pod that exploded may have significance. When looking at images of Endurance, it traditionally has the ""arm"" in the 3:00 position of the clock face the ship represents. The exploded pod therefore is at 10:00. This is interesting, as this is the tenth film Christopher Nolan has directed. This may have been intentional, or an odd coincidence.', u""Ellen Burstyn played the older version of Murph, who was the daughter of Matthew McConaughey's character Cooper.

He said it would have been dishonest of him to use trickery while playing Superman, and he wanted to push his body to the limits, to develop his physique into one that was worthy of the character.', u'Henry Cavill said that the most difficult part of making the movie, was definitely his two shirtless scenes. He had been training for months prior to filming, but for his shirtless scenes, he went on an extremely difficult diet and training regimen in which his calorie intake was cut from five thousand to nearly fifteen hundred for six weeks. After six weeks, he reached a body fat level of just seven percent, the level achieved by professional body-builders during competitions. Henry said he did this because he wanted to make his abs as pronounced and his muscles as defined as humanly possible, to create the best possible Superman physique. Cavill returned to a more manageable routine after the scenes were shot, but felt his effort was rewarded when audiences and critics alike praised his physique for the true embodiment of what Superman would look like. After he had shot his shirtless scenes, director Zack Snyder gave him a tub of ice cream and pizza to reward him for his Herculean effort for the shirtless scenes.', u'The film released in June 2013, the 75th anniversary of Superman.', u'Henry Cavill and Russell Crowe had met years prior to playing father and son when Henry was an extra in Proof of Life (2000), and received words of encouragement to pursue acting, and an autographed picture from Crowe, who was his favorite actor.', u'The idea that Superman\'s S-Shield means ""hope"" is taken from Mark Waid\'s ""Superman: Birthright"" comic: the S-Shield is the Kryptonian symbol for ""hope"", and Superman (1978) created the concept of the Shield being a Kryptonian herald for the house of El.', u'In an early Smallville scene near the Kent house, a double tanker truck passing by in the background bears the ""LexCorp"" brand name. Also, a building in Metropolis and a tanker truck later bear the name as well. This is the company run by Superman\'s arch rival, Lex Luthor.', u'Henry Cavill naturally has a hairy chest, and left it untouched for the shoot of this movie. He insisted that Superman has chest hair in this film; he rejected the notion that just because you are muscular, you should not have chest hair, and cited the Superman comic book ""The Death Of Superman"" as being an iconic representation, in which Superman had a hairy chest.', u'Clark\'s line ""Can\'t I keep pretending I\'m your son?"", and Jonathan\'s response, ""You are my son"", are taken from ""Superman: Secret Origin"" by Geoff Johns.', u'Rumors say that Zod\'s broadcast to Earth is made in several languages including the ""Star Trek"" Universe\'s Klingon, but there is no proof for this.', u""Zack Snyder said that he really wanted to include a shirtless scene of Henry Cavill in the film, because throughout the film, you see him in a form-fitting body suit where he appears extremely muscular. He said the audience would think it was all rubber muscles, but it was important to show them it was indeed Cavill's body in that suit, and that it was all real."", u""In the final fight scene between General Zod and Superman, Bruce Wayne's logo and company name (Wayne Financial) can be seen on the satellite that is destroyed during combat."", u'Henry Cavill embarked on a special four-month training regimen by his trainer Mark Twight to get the appropriate physique for his roles as Kal-El. He gained weight by drinking five one thousand-calorie protein shakes a day, then he did cardiovascular workouts to burn away the fat, and build muscle, and finally, he underwent a grueling two-hour workout to build up his muscles and abdomen. According to Cavill, the real problem he faced was the workout\'s intensity: ""Mark based his technique on going beyond yourself. Instead of slowing down towards the end of the workout, he asked me to actually work harder and harder for the body to reach its limits. His point was that if his client is able to walk out of the gym, he had not worked hard enough.""', u'Ben Affleck turned down directing the film, because he wasn\'t experienced in visual effects shots: ""A lesson I\'ve learned is to not look at movies based on budget, how much they\'ll spend on effects, or where they will shoot. Story is what\'s important."" He appeared as Batman in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016), which was directed by Zack Snyder.', u'When Clark is first learning to fly, he is only able to make a few gigantic bounds. In the first few Superman comics in 1938-9, he was not able to fly, but could only leap 1/8 of a mile like a high-powered kangaroo. The first cartoons and movies decided that this looked undignified, and made him fly, which looks more majestic, even though physics give no logical reason for him to have this ability.', u'According to Zack Snyder, the filmmakers outfitted Henry Cavill in the Superman (1978) costume to see how well he fit the role. Despite the outfit bearing a lighter blue color and red trunks, no one laughed at Cavill. Snyder knew then that Cavill was right for the role.', u'Amy Adams (Lois Lane) is only nine years younger than Diane Lane (Martha Kent).', u'According to David S. Goyer, Superman\'s costume is defined in this film to be an undergarment: ""All the battle armor goes on top of the suits. But since Superman\'s a refugee, his outfit doesn\'t have that gear, and would make him defenseless on his own Kryptonian turf."" This is also a nod to pop culture\'s running joke that Superman\'s costume appears to be underwear.', u'The filmmakers hired Professor Christine Schreyer, an expert in anthropology and linguistics at British Columbia, to create the Kryptonian language. She developed an object-subject-verb sentence structure, contrasting the subject-verb-object structure of English (for example, ""I see him"" in English would be ""Him I see"" in Kryptonian), to reflect that people on Krypton had become selfish and materialistic.', u""Matthew Goode, Armie Hammer, Matt Bomer, Joe Manganiello, Zac Efron, and Colin O'Donoghue were on the final shortlist for the lead role. Henry Cavill was finally cast. He was the front runner to play Superman in another Superman movie (working title: Flyby) but the movie failed to be greenlit, and Brandon Routh was cast in Superman Returns (2006) instead. Cavill was also a runner-up to Daniel Craig for the James Bond role in Casino Royale (2006), Christian Bale for Bruce Wayne a.k.a. Batman in Batman Begins (2005)."", u""This is Amy Adams' third time auditioning for Lois Lane. She first read for Lois Lane in Brett Ratner's abandoned film, then for Superman Returns (2006).

In the background, a pod with the ""S"" and spikes can be seen flying away. This is not the way it looks in this movie, but in fact how it appears in Superman (1978).', u'To completely distinguish this film as a new film separate from previous ones, the iconic ""Superman Theme"" by John Williams wasn\'t heard. This is the first Warner Brothers Superman film to not incorporate Williams\' score.', u""Costume Designer Michael Wilkinson said that while the Superman suit emphasized and highlighted Henry Cavill's muscular physique, for the scenes where he is playing Clark Kent, they tried to hide his physique by giving him layers of clothing, and baggy clothes so that he could blend in more. Only in one scene, does Clark wear a form-fitting t-shirt, which reveals that he is powerfully built, but that is when he is with Martha, who knows his identity."", u'This is the first live action Superman movie not to feature the character Jimmy Olsen. Not only was the Jimmy Olsen character in every live action Superman movie prior to Man of Steel (2013), but he was also in Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman (1993), Smallville (2001), and Supergirl (1984). Jimmy Olsen also appears in Supergirl (2015).', u'Superman\'s Kryptonian family name ""El"" is one of the Hebrew names for God, one of many savior allusions in the character\'s mythos. This comes from the original comic writers Jerry Siegel and Joe Schuster, who, being Jewish, would have been familiar with this trivia as part of their cultural heritage.', u'Distributed to theaters under the title ""Skyrim"".', u'According to David S. Goyer, the story\'s major theme is first contact: ""We approached Superman as if it weren\'t a comic book movie, as if it were real. He\'s an alien. If the world found out he existed, it would be the biggest thing that ever happened in human history. Just his existence would change the face of the Earth forever.""', u""When Clark talks to Father Leone, there is a stained-glass window behind him, which contains a painting of Christ in the garden of Gethsemane. This was where Christ prayed for strength to undergo the ordeal he will face, and parallels Clark's own need for support before his surrender."", u'When Superman learns to fly, he has a short flyover towards the camera. This is an homage to previous movies, in which Superman would fly over the Earth, and then smile at the camera.', u'The visual effects team described the Kryptonian computer displays as liquid geometry: ""It\'s a bunch of silver beads suspended through a magnetic field; the machine is able to control that magnetic field, so that the collection of beads behave like 3-D pixels, and create a surface that floats in the air and describes whatever the thing is you\'re supposed to be seeing.""', u'Bryan Singer and Brandon Routh expressed interest in reprising their positions from Superman Returns (2006) on this film. Singer had originally outlined several sequels to follow his story, and Routh was contracted as well. When Warner Brothers announced this film as a ""clean reboot"" from Singer\'s film, Routh still expressed interest in returning, before Zack Snyder declared that this movie would have no ties to any previous cinematic incarnation of the character.', u""According to the comics, General Zod's first name is Dru."", u""Zack Snyder originally planned for the infamous red trunks that Superman has worn throughout his 75 year existence, to be part of the suit in the movie. However, when looking over 1,500 different designs, he said that it just didn't work, so he decided to take them out."", u'Composer Hans Zimmer and Zack Snyder used what they considered the best drummers in the world to perform on the film\'s musical score. Zimmer created a single drum track for all of the drummers to play at the same time, but encouraged them to maintain their own unique styles. The drummers included Danny Carey, Pharrell Williams, Josh Freese, Sheila E., Jason Bonham, Toss Panos, Satnam Ramgotra, Matt Chamberlain, John Robinson (a.k.a. John ""J.R."" Robinson), Jim Keltner, Bernie Dresel, Curt Bisquera, Ryeland Allison, Vinnie Colaiuta, and Trevor Lawrence, Jr.', u'In a flashback scene, in which Clark Kent is being bullied, he is seen reading ""The Republic"" by Plato. In ""The Republic,"" Plato describes his ""Perfect Society,"" which mirrors the make-up of Kryptonian society as given here. Most obviously, both societies have preordained births, in which people are born into roles, such as leaders, warriors, or farmers.', u'While coming up with the aesthetic of how the Superman physique should look, trainer Mark Twight said the he wanted the classic V shape - broad shoulders and narrow waist, which Henry Cavill naturally had, he just had to pack on more muscle to his frame. Additionally, he said he looked to Steve Reeves\' physique in Voittamaton Herkules (1958) as a model for Superman, as to attain a Greek God ideal. Zack Snyder instructed Henry Cavill, that his physique should look so great that in his shirtless scenes, he had to look like a ""freak"", and be in ""absolutely crazy shape"". Zack Snyder was subsequently very impressed with the results of Henry Cavill\'s eleven month hard training, and called his physique ""a great accomplishment"". Henry Cavill said that even he was surprised by how big he looked in the film.', u'Gal Gadot was originally cast as Faora, but had to drop out due to her pregnancy, and Antje Traue was cast in her place.

The now deceased, London-born Lee Quigley played Superman as a baby, in Superman (1978). Lee Quigley died from inhaling solvents at the age of fourteen.', u'The majority of the action scenes use a CGI cape for Superman, and CGI armor for the other Kryptonians.', u'Laurence Fishburne based his performance as Perry White on CBS correspondent Ed Bradley: ""Ed was a friend, a mentor, and a role model for me. Particularly because he worked in journalism, and he was the kind of guy who walked with kings, but he had the common touch."" In homage to Bradley, White has an ear piercing.', u'The Fortress of Solitude in this film is a Kryptonian spacecraft secreted in the Arctic. This combines various comic versions of the Fortress of Solitude: an Arctic location with a key (the Silver Age comics (1958)), an artifact from previous Kryptonians (""Adventures of Superman"" (1989)), and an abandoned ship (the New 52 comics (2011)).', u'The tornado scene stirred some controversy with the National Weather Service as overpasses are not considered to be safe shelters in the event of a tornado due to the wind funneling effect increasing the likelihood of being struck by debris. In 1991, many thought overpasses were safe, after a highly publicized video of a television film crew and several others taking shelter under an overpass, during a tornado near El Dorado, Kansas, survived, although the overpass did not take a direct hit. However, in 1999, during the deadly Moore and Bridge Creek, Oklahoma F-5 tornado, several people were killed seeking shelter in overpasses, prompting the National Weather Service, and other weather agencies to proclaim them as unsafe. Ironically, the Moore, Oklahoma area got hit by another deadly tornado about a month before the theatrical release of this film, prompting Zach Snyder to consider removing the tornado scene from the movie, although he ultimately kept it, as Superman would have had to deal with all manners of disasters and tragedies.', u""When Jor-El escapes the Council, there is a shattered moon can be seen in the sky.

Both of them have been involved in competing projects about Wyatt Earp: Glenn was cast in Tombstone (1993), but had to drop out, while Costner played Wyatt Earp in Wyatt Earp (1994) opposite Gene Hackman (the original Lex Luthor) as his father. Ironically, Russell Crowe, who plays Jor-El, Superman's other father, has also done a Glenn Ford role.

This refers to DC Comics Writer and Editor Mort Weisinger, who created the Kryptonian solar empathy (yellow sun strength, and red sun weakness). - When Clark is being bullied, it\'s in the vicinity of ""Sullivan Truck and Tractor Repair,"" which is a nod to Chloe Sullivan, who was Clark\'s best friend, and most trusted sidekick on Smallville (2001), and an original character created for the show. Also, in the same scene, Clark is bullied by a gang led by Whitney Fordham, a character who was inspired by Whitney Fordman, another character created for the show as Lana Lang\'s boyfriend in season one. - The Smallville barbershop is named ""Otto\'s Barber Styling"". Otto refers to DC Comics Writer Otto Binder, who created Supergirl, Krypto, Brainiac, the Phantom Zone, and Jimmy Olsen\'s signal watch. - During the Smallville fight, the residents take shelter in the post office, known as Ezra\'s Mail Depot. According to Smallville (2001), the hometown was founded by Ezra Small. - When Zod uses his heat vision for the first time, there is a small sign that says ""Keep Calm and Call Batman"" on the wall behind Superman. - When Zod hurls the tanker truck, there is a smiley face behind Superman. A smiley face was the motif for the ""Watchmen"" comic, which Zack Snyder had previously adapted. - When Superman and Zod charge each other at the skyscraper, a sign for ""Blaze Comics"" can be spotted. This was a fictional publishing company that the DC Comics hero Booster Gold hired to tell his tales. - As Superman flies after Zod, a sign for ""S.T.A.R. Labs"" is spotted. Scientific and Technoligical Advanced Research Laboratories is a research facility that debuted in a 1971 Superman comic. - Continuing the flight, there is a sign for ""Utopia Casinos"" and ""WGBS News"". These are properties owned by unscrupulous businessmen (Tony Gallo and Morgan Edge, respectively), against whom Superman faced off. Earlier in the film, during one of the scenes at the Kent house, a double tanker truck passing by in the background bears the ""LexCorp"" brand name. Also, a building in Metropolis and a tanker truck later bear the name as well. This is the company run by Superman\'s archrival, Lex Luthor.', u""The final confrontation between Superman and General Zod was filmed in Chicago's Union Station.

This same staircase was the scene of the final gunfight in The Untouchables (1987), starring Kevin Costner, who plays Jonathan Kent."", u'The World Engine, like many other aspects of Kryptonian tech and architecture, is modeled after a biological system, specifically a bacteriophage. Bacteriophages are viruses that infect bacteria and hijack their internal resources so that the bacteria start producing viral proteins instead of their own. Consequently, the depiction of the World Engine as a bacteriophage is most appropriate, as the device was intended to hijack Earth resources, for the benefit of Kryptonians.', u""Jonathan Kent's birth year (according to his headstone) is 1951, the same year that George Reeves filmed Superman and the Mole-Men (1951), his first outing as Clark Kent before Adventures of Superman (1952)."", u'Russell Crowe is stabbed by a knife to the side prior to death.

Unfortunately, her agent had to calm the actress down--he had called to let her know that she\'d been invited to host the Academy Awards. Hathaway has said she was so shocked she went numb at the offer. Fortunately, shortly thereafter, her agent phoned again to let her know that she had been offered the part of Catwoman as well.', u'According to Christopher Nolan, Bane was chosen as the film\'s main antagonist ""to test Batman mentally as well as physically.""', u'Christopher Nolan wanted Marion Cotillard so much for the role of Miranda Tate, that he modified the filming schedule to accommodate her pregnancy.

Bane burns a picture of Harvey Dent and explains that Dent became the villain Two-Face after his injuries and encourages the city\'s poor to attack the wealthy and powerful before he destroys Blackgate, releasing all the inmates;A brief scene of Selina escaping Blackgate;A series of extended or omitted scenes showing the mercenaries seeing the burning Bat-signal on Gotham Bridge.An extensive flashback sequence after Batman defeats Bane. Bane confesses that his devotion to Ra\'s Al Guhl stems from the League of Shadows rescuing him from the pit. A flashback scene then shows Ra\'s Al Guhl training Bane, who he has provided with a crude prototype mask to numb his pain;A scene of Talia openly taking charge of the League of Shadows to form a convoy to detonate the neutron bomb. She then floods the reactor core and, as in the film, Fox tries to escape, though even the finished scenes of Fox in the film occur earlier in the script version;A longer argument between Blake and the Army blockade on Gotham Bridge. Blake argues with the commanding officer, trying to convince him that Batman has returned and battle has broken out in the city streets.In the script, after Batman harnesses the bomb to The Bat, he\'s never seen again--The Bat simply flies out to sea and the bomb detonates. The scene of Fox and the technicians examining the autopilot of The Bat then follows, with Fox realizing that Batman had ejected before the bomb detonated, and that Bruce Wayne must have survived the explosion.', u'Christian Bale has stated that he would not play Batman if Robin appeared anywhere in the trilogy. Christopher Nolan agreed not to include Robin as it would undermine the dark tone of his series. At the end of the film, Detective John Blake\'s (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) legal name is revealed to be ""Robin"", and he quits the police force and is shown to enter the Batcave by following the instructions presumably left by Bruce Wayne in his will.', u""Leonardo DiCaprio, Ryan Gosling, and Mark Ruffalo were considered to play John Blake before Joseph Gordon-Levitt was ultimately cast. DiCaprio was one of the actors considered to play Robin in Batman Forever (1995) before Chris O'Donnell got the part."", u'In a final bit of foreshadowing as to her character\'s true nature, Miranda Tate, after Bruce apologizes for being unable to get her out of the city, tells Bruce to ""do what is necessary."" Her father, Ra\'s al Ghul, repeatedly derides Bruce for lacking ""the courage to do what is necessary"" in Batman Begins (2005)', u'The final chase sequence, and subsequent bombing, where the countdown of the time-bomb is eleven minutes, is depicted in real-time.', u'There are several moments in the film where it is hinted that the child was not Bane. Bane tells Batman he never saw light, until he was already a man. Furthermore, the child who escapes from the pit, is not scarred, despite the fact we know Bane was mistreated within the prison.', u""In the scene at the end where the lawyer's clerk, played by Jillian Armenante, reveals John Blake's real name, the word 'Robin' was dubbed-in post-production to keep this secret from all the crew, including Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who were on-set at the time."", u'At the charity ball, Miranda Tate says ""you must invest if you wish to restore balance to the world,"" hinting at her true identity as Talia. In Batman Begins (2005), Ra\'s al Ghul says that the mission of The League of Shadows is to restore balance to the world.', u""In all three Nolan Batman films, the spiked gauntlets on Batman's arms prove essential in defeating the main villain. They shatter Ra's al Ghul's sword in Batman Begins (2005), knock the detonator out of the Joker's hands in The Dark Knight (2008) and damage Bane's mask in The Dark Knight Rises (2012)."", u'At the end of the movie when ""Robin"" Blake is exploring the Batcave, his black jacket has a blue stripe that dips in the middle on the back of it. This is very reminiscent to the character Nightwing, the adult version of Robin.', u'Bane has a triangular scar on the side of his head, most visible during the stock exchange scene. Miranda Tate has an identical scar on her back, noticeable during her love scene with Bruce, thus another hint at her membership in the League of Shadows and true identity as Talia.', u""The villainous character portrayed by Liam Neeson Ra's al Ghul, who died by the end of the first movie, makes an appearance before Bruce Wayne's eyes, claiming to be immortal the whole time, only to be revealed as a hallucination. This is a reference to Ra's al Ghul's comic book counterpart, in which the character IS immortal, by the use of Lazarus Pits."", u'During the fight between Bane and Batman in the sewers, Bane lifts Batman above his head and drops him across his knee. This is a direct parallel to the first fight between Batman and Bane from the comics, where Bane broke Batman\'s back during the ""Knightfall"" story line.', u'Some viewers found the scene at the end of the movie ambiguous, in which Alfred sees Bruce and Selina at a caf\xe9. While some took it at face value (that Bruce survived and Alfred really saw him), others thought that Bruce was dead, and saw the caf\xe9 scene as a non-literal fantasy nod to Alfred\'s stated wish from earlier in the movie that Bruce might be able to someday find peace, and a normal life. In a December 2012 interview with the Los Angeles Times, Sir Michael Caine seemed to settle the question when he said that Bruce was supposed to be unambiguously alive during the scene: ""They were there....They were real. There was no imagination. They were real and he was with Anne Hathaway (who played Selina Kyle), the cat lady, and I was happy ever after for him as I told him during the picture."" Furthermore, the film\'s shooting script also specifies, that Bruce is alive during the caf\xe9 scene. A line of spoken dialogue towards the end of the film, also notes that Martha Wayne\'s pearls are missing from the Wayne estate. In the final scene, Selina is seen wearing the necklace.', u""Bane putting his hand on John Daggett's shoulder before killing him was Tom Hardy 's idea."", u'In the film there are a total of five Oscar winners: Christian Bale, Sir Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Marion Cotillard, Anne Hathaway, and four Oscar nominees: Gary Oldman, Tom Conti, Liam Neeson, Tom Hardy Additionally, Oscar nominee Maggie Gyllenhaal appears in archive footage, bringing the total nominees to ten, unprecedented in a comic book film.', u'The soundtrack played when Bruce supposedly died, is the same soundtrack that is played when his parents died in Batman Begins (2005).', u'After The Dark Knight (2008) was released, Aaron Eckhart expressed interest in returning as Harvey ""Two-Face"" Dent. Christopher Nolan stated that Dent was definitely dead, and that his death would leave lasting repercussions across Gotham.', u""The citizens of Gotham make several attempts, without Batman's aid, to rise up against Bane and the League of Shadows. These attempts all fail, because they are caught by members of the League, indicating someone had sold them out. Miranda Tate appears with rebellious citizens in each of these scenes."", u'This is the only Batman film where Jim Gordon learns the true identity of Batman.', u'The original story treatment by David S. Goyer, as outlined before the production of Batman Begins (2005), was to have Two-Face as the principal antagonist for the film. Initially, at the end of The Dark Knight (2008), the Joker would have scarred Harvey Dent at a courtroom trial, setting up the third film. Dent\'s death and fall was put in at the end of the second film instead, to set up the aftermath that follows. Following the release of this film, Nolan elaborated on his choice to include the Two-Face story in the prior film: he wanted each movie to stand on its own as a complete story, and not ""tease"" any sequels--a practice that had become common amongst comic book films. Nolan feels that holding back story or leaving a film open-ended for a sequel, on which to build, is a cheat to the audience, which deserves to see a movie that has consumed all of the filmmakers\' creative energy.', u'It is shown in flashbacks that Bane was still an adult when Miranda was a child. Tom Hardy, who plays Bane, is two years younger than Marion Cotillard, who plays Miranda.', u'When Batman is chasing after Bane for the first time, after the stock exchange robbery, an older policeman tells his younger partner to ""sit back, you\'re in for a show"". This is an almost direct quote from the graphic novel ""Batman: The Dark Knight Returns.""', u'Between Fox, Alfred, Blake, and Gordon, only Blake and Gordon do not discover that Bruce Wayne/Batman survived.', u'In the comics, Bane carried an apparatus that contains a steroid that amplifies his strength and fighting ability. In the film, the apparatus he carries contains an anesthetic, as he is in chronic pain. In both the comics and the film, Batman defeats Bane in a similar way, by damaging his mask, depriving him of the drug.', u'In addition to the numerous elements from the ""Knightfall,"" ""The Dark Knight Returns,"" and ""No Man\'s Land"" storylines, the film also borrows from the ""Legacy"" storyline, which involves Bane becoming Ra\'s Al Ghul\'s successor and plotting with the League of Shadows to destroy Gotham City.', u'This is the only live-action Batman film, where the Bat-signal is never used.', u""According to The Hollywood Reporter, Anne Hathaway's stunt double broke one of the IMAX cameras when she crashed the Batpod into it. This marks the second time an IMAX camera has been destroyed on a Christopher Nolan Batman film - a previous camera was smashed when filming the Joker's underground truck chase in The Dark Knight (2008)."", u'Eva Green, Naomi Watts, Rachel Weisz, and Kate Winslet were considered to play Miranda Tate, before Marion Cotillard finally got the role in February 2011, when she was six months pregnant. Cotillard started filming one month after she gave birth to her son, Marcel. In October 2010, it was reported that she had turned down the roles of Catwoman and Talia Al Ghul in the film, but as of 2016, there is no official confirmation that she was considered to play Catwoman.', u""John Blake's real name, Robin, is an allusion to the character in Batman comic books, movies, and television shows. Robin was added to the Batman comic books in 1940, to attract younger readers, and the character eventually evolved into a solo superhero, Nightwing. Blake, though an original character, combines elements of the various Robins from the comics - an orphan (like Dick Grayson), a street kid (like Jason Todd), and a skilled detective who deduces Batman's true identity (like Tim Drake), all of whom trained as Batman's sidekick, with the implication that they one day would don the Batman costume."", u'According to Jonathan Nolan, a major influence on the story is Charles Dickens\'s socio-political novel ""A Tale of Two Cities"", which dealt with revolution and class conflict. In an homage to the story, two characters in the film are named Stryver and Barsad, after two similarly named characters in the book. Also, when Commissioner Gordon gives a eulogy for Bruce, he uses the ending soliloquy in regards to Batman, who, like the novel\'s hero Sydney Carton, sacrificed himself to save people.', u""The coloring and shading of the cloth draping the Batman Memorial Statue during its unveiling was similar to the blue colors of Batman's costume as traditionally seen in the comics."", u""In each part of the trilogy, Batman/Bruce Wayne has either a friend who turns into the villain or vice versa:    -Batman Begins (2005): Ra's Al Ghul trains Bruce Wayne, and then turns against him.    -The Dark Knight (2008): Harvey Dent a.k.a. Two-Face is an ally of Bruce Wayne, then afterwards, opposes Batman, blaming him for Rachel's death, and his transformation.    -The Dark Knight Rises (2012): Catwoman/Selina Kyle initially steals from Bruce Wayne (Lamborghini and necklace), then tricks him into Banes underground hiding. Near the end she sides with Batman over Bane.    Also, Miranda is initially an ally of Bruce Wayne and Wayne Enterprises. Near the end, she reveals herself to be a villain all along."", u'Though not shown in the final cut, the fight scene on Gotham City Hall steps, included an explosion that cleared the steps of all the fighters still alive. When filming the actual explosion, the heat triggered a fire alarm, that went directly to the authorities; which caused production to stop for more than thirty minutes, while the film staff cleared everything with the police and Fire Marshal when they arrived.', u'The filmmakers cite the ""Batman"" comics \'The Dark Knight Returns\' (an aged Batman operates in a future Gotham), \'Knightfall\' (Bane pushes Batman physically and mentally, causing him to burn out) and \'No Man\'s Land\' (Gotham descends into post-apocalyptic gangland territory, and is cut off from the rest of the U.S.) as major influences on the film.', u'This marks the second trilogy of movies in which Liam Neeson plays a character who is killed in the first movie, only to subsequently return incorporeally to communicate with a central character in a later movie (the other trilogy being the Star Wars prequels.)', u""Despite being portrayed by Caucasian actors in The Dark Knight Trilogy, the Batman comic books associate Ra's Al Ghul and his daughter Talia Al Ghul with Arabic-Asiatic attributes, and Bane is almost consistently associated with Hispanic-Caribbean traits and origins."", u""The first Batman movie not to feature Batman driving the Batmobile. He only uses the Bat-pod and the Bat (flying vehicle). While several variations of Tumblers do make an appearance, they are all operated by Bane and his thugs, after they steal them from Wayne Enterprises' Applied Science Division, and these have a desert camouflage paint job, so it could be argued that the Batmobile doesn't make any appearance at all."", u'Christian Bale and Sir Michael Caine spent several weeks filming exterior shots of Wayne Manor at Wollaton Hall, Nottingham, but Christopher Nolan just used one shot of Bale as Batman, in silhouette on the roof, and one shot of Caine at the gravesite.', u'This, and the other live-action Batman film to feature Bane as a villain, Batman & Robin (1997), show the Batman logo during the opening sequence freezing, and then cracking.', u""When the fusion reactor is first introduced in the bunker, the design is almost identical to the microwave emitter design that Ra's Al Ghul stole from Wayne Enterprises and brought into the city in Batman Begins (2005)."", u'It is always alluded that Bane is the child that escapes from The Pit by the use of non-specific terms such as simply ""a child"" rather than ""young boy"" or ""young girl"" and the character having a shaved head. This allusion is fed back to Bruce in the form of the hallucination of Ra\'s Al Ghul.', u""When Officer Blake mentions giant alligators in the sewers, this is a reference to Killer Croc (who makes his big-screen debut in Suicide Squad (2016)). In the comics, Killer Croc has clashed with Bane, the main villain. Bane broke both of Croc's arms, before fighting Batman and breaking his back."", u""The same musical cue is used in all three movies of The Dark Knight Trilogy when Batman deals the final blow to his main adversary. All three of these moments involve gravity getting the best of the villain. The train careens off the tracks in Batman Begins (2005) with Raz Al-Ghul inside. The Joker falls off the Pruitt Building in The Dark Knight (2008), and Talia Al'Ghul drives off the upper level of Grand Avenue in The Dark Knight Rises (2012)."", u""When Bane enters the stock exchange trading floor, he wears a backpack that has a logo 'DCS courier services.' Batman is a DC Comics Superhero."", u""The only time Bane shoots a gun in the movie, is at one of his henchmen in the sewer. The other time he tries to use a gun, is when he attempts to kill Batman before he's killed by Catwoman on the Batpod."", u'This is the second film directed by Christopher Nolan in which Marion Cotillard stabs someone, the first was Inception (2010).', u""The entrance to the Batcave, shown in the ending sequence, when Blake is following the instructions, was shot in Wales, Christian Bale's home country."", u'Bane is the only principle villain seen to be killed. In Batman Begins, we assume Ducard to be killed in the falling monorail carriage, but do not see his body. In The Dark Knight, we do not know if the Joker was killed at all, thereby making Bane the only primary villain seen dying on-screen.', u'Batman tells Blake to get as many Gothamites out of the city before the bomb goes off, that ""We need an exodus"". Christian Bale later played Moses in Exodus: Gods and Kings (2014), based upon the biblical book of Exodus.', u'One major hint that the child is not Bane is the fact that the protecter of the child has the same build size and fighting skills that Bane uses throughout the film.', u""In the football scene, the surviving player has the name Ward on his shirt. In the Batman (1966) television series, Robin was played by Burt Ward. The surviving player's real-life name is Hines Ward."", u'In this film Marion Cotillard\'s character is trying to destroy the city using the atomic bomb. Interestingly, the next blockbuster starring Cotillard, Assassin\'s Creed (2016), is having her character quoting J. Robert Oppenheimer, one of the creators of the atom bomb, by saying ""Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds"".']","[u'USA::16 July 2012 (New York City, New York)\n (premiere)', u'UK::18 July 2012 (London)\n (premiere)', u'Australia::19 July 2012', u'Hong Kong::19 July 2012', u'South Korea::19 July 2012 (limited)', u'Malaysia::19 July 2012', u'New Zealand::19 July 2012', u'Philippines::19 July 2012', u'Singapore::19 July 2012', u'Thailand::19 July 2012', u'Taiwan::19 July 2012', u'Canada::20 July 2012', u'Denmark::20 July 2012', u'Spain::20 July 2012', u'Finland::20 July 2012', u'UK::20 July 2012', u'Indonesia::20 July 2012', u'Ireland::20 July 2012', u'Israel::20 July 2012', u'India::20 July 2012', u'Netherlands::20 July 2012', u'USA::20 July 2012', u'Argentina::24 July 2012 (Buenos Aires)\n (premiere)', u'Belgium::25 July 2012', u'Switzerland::25 July 2012 (French speaking region)', u'France::25 July 2012', u'Iceland::25 July 2012', u'Morocco::25 July 2012', u'Norway::25 July 2012', u'Sweden::25 July 2012', u'Trinidad and Tobago::25 July 2012', u'Argentina::26 July 2012', u'Bosnia and Herzegovina::26 July 2012', u'Bolivia::26 July 2012', u'Switzerland::26 July 2012 (German speaking region)', u'Chile::26 July 2012', u'Czech Republic::26 July 2012', u'Germany::26 July 2012', u'Georgia::26 July 2012', u'Croatia::26 July 2012', u'Hungary::26 July 2012', u'Cambodia::26 July 2012', u'Kazakhstan::26 July 2012', u'Peru::26 July 2012', u'Serbia::26 July 2012', u'Russia::26 July 2012', u'Slovenia::26 July 2012', u'Slovakia::26 July 2012', u'Ukraine::26 July 2012', u'Uruguay::26 July 2012', u'Austria::27 July 2012', u'Bulgaria::27 July 2012', u'Brazil::27 July 2012', u'Colombia::27 July 2012', u'Costa Rica::27 July 2012', u'Ecuador::27 July 2012', u'Estonia::27 July 2012', u'Japan::27 July 2012', u'Lithuania::27 July 2012', u'Latvia::27 July 2012', u'Republic of Macedonia::27 July 2012 (Skopje)', u'Mexico::27 July 2012', u'Nigeria::27 July 2012', u'Panama::27 July 2012', u'Poland::27 July 2012', u'Paraguay::27 July 2012', u'Romania::27 July 2012', u'Turkey::27 July 2012', u'Venezuela::27 July 2012', u'Vietnam::27 July 2012', u'South Africa::27 July 2012', u'Portugal::2 August 2012', u'Armenia::10 August 2012', u'Egypt::15 August 2012', u'United Arab Emirates::16 August 2012', u'Lebanon::16 August 2012', u'Egypt::17 August 2012', u'Bahrain::18 August 2012', u'Kuwait::18 August 2012', u'Pakistan::20 August 2012', u'Greece::21 August 2012', u'China::27 August 2012', u'China::28 August 2012', u'Switzerland::29 August 2012 (Italian speaking region)', u'Italy::29 August 2012']",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Inception team similar to roles that are used in filmmaking - Cobb is the Director, Arthur is the Producer, Ariadne is the Production Designer, Eames is the Actor, Saito is the Studio, and Fischer is the Audience. ""In trying to write a team-based creative process, I wrote the one I know,"" said Nolan.', u'In an effort to combat confusion, television broadcasts in Japan include text in the upper-left corner of the screen to remind viewers which level of the dream a specific scene takes place in.', u""In spite of the film's extensive surreal effects sequences, the majority of visual effects throughout the film, such as the Penrose stairs, rotating hallway, mountain avalanche, and zero-gravity sequences, were created through practical methods, not through the use of computer graphics imagery. The film only has around five hundred visual effects shots, as opposed to most other visual effects epics which can have upwards of 2000 visual effects shots."", u""Leonardo DiCaprio was Director Christopher Nolan's and Producer Emma Thomas's only choice for the role of Cobb."", u'If you take the first letters of the main characters\' names - Dom, Robert, Eames, Arthur, Mal and Saito - they spell ""Dreams"".  If you add Peter, Ariadne and Yusuf, the whole makes ""Dreams Pay"", which is what they do for a mind thief.', u'Christopher Nolan first pitched the film to Warner Bros. after the completion of his third feature, Insomnia (2002), and was met with approval from the studio. However, it was not yet written at the time, and Nolan determined that rather than writing it as an assignment, it would be more suitable to his working style, if he wrote it as a speculation script, and then presented it to the studio whenever it was completed. So he went off to write it, thinking it would take ""a couple of months"", but it ultimately took nearly eight years.', u'Joseph Gordon-Levitt performed all but one of his own stunts during the fight scene in the spinning hallway.', u'According to Cinematographer Wally Pfister, Warner Brothers executives approached Christopher Nolan about making the film in 3-D, but he refused the idea, claiming ""it will distract the storytelling experience of Inception"".', u'Joseph Gordon-Levitt went to his audition after a brief character summary, wearing a full suit ""just in case"", unknowingly matching his character\'s wardrobe perfectly.', u'During production, details of the film\'s plot were kept secret. Christopher Nolan, who wrote the script, cryptically described it as a contemporary science fiction action thriller ""set within the architecture of the mind.""', u""Christopher Nolan has said that the snow-based third-level dream was inspired by his favorite James Bond film On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1969)."", u'It took ten years for Christopher Nolan to write the screenplay for this movie.', u""Just like Christopher Nolan's previous movie The Dark Knight (2008), no second unit team was hired for making the movie. All the shots were filmed by Nolan with Wally Pfister."", u'When explaining why he thinks implanting an idea is not possible, Arthur says ""don\'t think about elephants"" to actually make Saito think of them and thus ""insert"" an idea into his mind. The line is a reference to the title of a famous cognitive semantics book, \'Don\'t Think of an Elephant\' by George Lakoff. The book describes conceptual framing, the use of certain words to literally insert certain ideas about a subject into the listener\'s mind in a surreptitious way, e.g. implanting the idea that taxes are a bad thing by using the phrase ""tax relief.""', u'The role of Saito was written exclusively for Ken Watanabe, because Christopher Nolan felt that although he had appeared in Batman Begins (2005), he did not have much screen time, and should therefore be given a more prominent supporting role.', u'""Yusuf"" is the Arabic form of ""Joseph"", the Biblical figure from Genesis 37-50, who had the gift of interpreting dreams. He was sold out by his brothers to slavery. Through his gift of dream interpretation, he helped Pharaoh to prepare for the disaster of the ""seven lean years"" and was rewarded as a result. The same story is also told in the Quran.', u'Dom Cobb\'s main objective is to get Home. Dom is the word for \'home\' in most Slavic languages (e.g. Russian and Croatian), derived from the Latin word ""Domus"". Words like ""domesticated"" and ""domicile"" all share the same ""dom"" root.', u'One of the reasons why Christopher Nolan cast Tom Hardy as Eames was because of his performance in the film RocknRolla (2008). Hardy stated that he thought he was cast because of his role in Bronson (2008). He arrived on set only to learn that Nolan has never even seen Bronson.', u'The movie\'s runtime (2 hours and 28 min) is a reference to the original length of \xc9dith Piaf\'s song ""Non, je ne regrette rien"", which lasts (on its first recorded edition) 2 minutes and 28 seconds.', u'The sixth Christopher Nolan movie (out of the nine) to enter the IMDb Top 250, along with Memento (2000), Batman Begins (2005), The Prestige (2006), The Dark Knight (2008), The Dark Knight Rises (2012), Interstellar (2014) and Dunkirk (2017).', u'The name of the character Cobb references Henry N. Cobb, an American architect notable for designing skyscrapers. The world Cobb and Mal made in Limbo consists mostly of skyscrapers.', u'A direct translation of the lyrics for the song ""Non, je ne regrette rien"" as performed by \xc9dith Piaf is: ""I regret nothing/no, I have no regrets/I regret neither the good things that were done to me nor the bad things/They are all the same to me/...The past is payed, swept away, forgotten/I don\'t care of the past anymore/I set my memories on fire/My agonies, and my pleasures/I don\'t need them any more/Swept away in the agonies of love/Swept away forever, I\'m restarting with nothing..."" Christopher Nolan has made a point of saying that he chose the song specifically for the movie, which is heavily concerned with the effect of memories on the psyche, and specifically the disastrous effect that not letting go of memories of love-gone-wrong can have on the subconscious--exactly what the song discusses. Also of note: in the original French, ""I regret neither the good things done to me nor the bad things"" is ""Ni le bien qu\'on m\'a fait ni le mal,"" and since Cobb\'s wife is named Mal, that gives the line a double meaning.', u""Kate Winslet was approached for the role of Mal, but turned it down, citing that she couldn't see herself as the character."", u'In the city scene on the first level of the dream with Fischer, the state motto on the license plates of the cars reads ""The Alternate State"".', u'The \xc9dith Piaf song ""Non, je ne regrette rien"" is used as a plot device. Marion Cotillard played Piaf in La Vie en Rose (2007). Christopher Nolan has stated that this is ""pure coincidence"". After Cotillard was cast, Nolan intended to change the song to eliminate speculation on the subject, but composer Hans Zimmer persuaded him to keep it.', u'Despite prominent billing, Sir Michael Caine only gets three minutes of screentime.', u'Marion Cotillard\'s character is named \'Mal\', which is short for \'Malorie\', a name derived from the French word \'malheur\', meaning misfortune or unhappiness. The shorter version \'mal\' means wrong/bad or evil (when a noun) in French, as well as some other Latin-based languages. Years after starring in Inception, Cotillard starred in the French film Kaikki mit\xe4 rakastimme (2016), whose original title is ""Mal de Pierres"" (Stone Pain/Stone Ache).', u'Ariadne, in Greek mythology, was the daughter of King Minos of Crete and his queen, Pasipha\xeb. She aided Theseus in overcoming the Minotaur by giving him a ball of red fleece thread that she was spinning, so that he could find his way out of the Minotaur\'s labyrinth. The myth was also the basis for Richard Strauss & Hugo von Hofmannsthal\'s opera ""Ariadne auf Naxos,"" a play within a play, just as the movie is about a dream within a dream.', u'The ""Penrose stairs"" (with a woman perpetually picking up papers) that Arthur shows Ariadne is a reference to a lithograph print by the Dutch graphic artist M.C.

This is all to reinforce the importance of the number throughout the film. Mathematically, the number 528491 is a prime number.', u'Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy co-starred in The Revenant (2015), but this time playing enemies.

Furthermore, when music is heard by someone who is currently within a dream, the music is perceived as slowed down. Thus, the main theme of the film score is almost exactly what the beginning of ""Non, je ne regrette rien"" would sound like to a dreamer. This thematic device is brought to its logical conclusion when the song plays at the end of the credits, signaling that the audience is about to \'wake up\' from the film.', u'During an interview, Christopher Nolan addressed the ambiguous ending, saying he believes Cobb makes it home to his children, although it is open to interpretation by the viewer. He further claimed that the point of not seeing whether or not the top stops spinning is that Cobb no longer obsesses over his dreams.', u""Not counting flashbacks, Cobb's wedding ring only appears in scenes where he is dreaming.

The movie explains to the audience the significance of Fischer\'s number in that it will subconsciously keep reappearing in dreams (e.g. the phone number, hotel rooms, safe combo); in light of this, the audience can watch the whole movie prepared and notice that the train that ran Cobb and Mal over in Limbo had a number on it. A combination of those numbers is used on the taxi cab that Mal and Cob get out of in the ""real world,"" as well as in their hotel room in the ""real world."" Suppose the whole movie was a dream. If it was, then Nolan cleverly made the movie exactly 2 hours and 28 minutes for a reason, the song continually played to wake people up ""from the dream"" is 2 minutes 28 seconds.', u'This was the last movie shot on film to win an Academy Award for Best Cinematography. All of the winners since were shot digitally until 2016, when La La Land broke the streak.', u'In the end, when Cobb uses his spinning top, the answer (Real vs. Dream) is foreshadowed, when he clears Customs earlier, and you briefly see his left hand as he hands over his passport.', u'Leonardo DiCaprio has stated in an interview, that in his mind, Cobb makes it out to the real world and his kids.', u'Cobb and Mal spent 50 years in limbo. At one point, it is stated that 10 seconds in the first dream world is 3 minutes in the next and 60 minutes in the dream after that. That equates to time increasing roughly 18 times each dream. Since Cobb was able to be in limbo within the 4th dream, if you break down the math, that equates to about 7.5 days for every 10 seconds. Breaking it down further, 50 years would be around 10.5 to 11 hours being asleep.

(1989): ""Jack was like a clown figure, benign but wicked, maybe a killer old uncle. He could be funny and make you laugh. Heath\'s gone in a completely different direction to Jack, he\'s like a really scary psychopath. He\'s a lovely guy and his Joker is going to be a hell of a revelation in this picture."" Caine bases this belief on a scene where the Joker pays a visit to Bruce Wayne\'s penthouse. He\'d never met Ledger before, so when Ledger arrived and performed he gave Caine such a fright, he forgot his lines.', u""In preparation for his role as The Joker, Heath Ledger hid away in a motel room for about six weeks. During this extended stay of seclusion, Ledger delved deep into the psychology of the character. He devoted himself to developing The Joker's every tic, namely the voice and that sadistic-sounding laugh (for the voice, Ledger's goal was to create a tone that didn't echo the work Jack Nicholson did in his 1989 performance as the Joker). Ledger's interpretation of The Joker's appearance was primarily based on the chaotic, disheveled look of punk rocker Sid Vicious combined with the psychotic mannerisms of Malcolm McDowell's character, Alex De Large, from A Clockwork Orange (1971)."", u""Heath Ledger's sudden death from drug toxicity on January 22, 2008 prompted immediate speculation over the film's state and Ledger's disposition prior to death. Soon after Ledger's death was announced, Warner Brothers issued a statement that verified that Ledger had finished all of his scenes in principal photography, as well as post-production fulfillments (i.e., looping), thus making The Joker his final, completed film role. Rumors abounded that playing the intense role had taken its toll on Ledger's mental state, causing him to become depressed and take a wrong combination of drugs as a result. However, his family has since put such rumors to rest, by stating that far from being depressed, he had a lot of fun playing the role. Ledger did suffer from insomnia throughout his life, and would often take sleeping pills together with other prescription drugs (something his sister had actually warned against the night before his death). Unfortunately, the mix he took on that night proved to be a fatal combination."", u""Heath Ledger directed both homemade videos that the Joker sends to GCN himself. The first video involving the fake Batman, was done under Christopher Nolan's supervision. Nolan thought Ledger had done so well with that sequence, he felt there was no need for him to be there when it came time to film the scene where reporter Mike Engel reads the Joker's statement. He put his trust in Ledger and let him do whatever he wanted, ultimately pleased with the result, after he'd seen the outcome."", u""Made more money than Batman Begins (2005)'s entire domestic run in only six days of release."", u'While the movie was filming a chase scene on Lake Street, the Chicago Police Department received several calls from concerned citizens stating that the police were involved in a vehicle pursuit with a dark vehicle of unknown make or model.', u'While the film is dedicated to Heath Ledger, it also bears a dedication to Conway Wickliffe, a stuntman who was killed when the car he was driving crashed.', u'While filming the chase scene with the Joker and the SWAT vans, one of only four IMAX cameras in the world at that time was destroyed.', u""Trouble arose during a PR campaign before the movie's release, when a website related to the film, sent out several cakes purportedly from The Joker, containing a cell phone inside which made the cake vibrate, and had wires sticking out, making the cake look like a bomb. One such news station, which received one of the cakes, believed it to be an actual terrorist act, and the entire building had to be evacuated."", u'Heath Ledger kept licking his lips, because the way he speaks during his performance, requires him to have a moist mouth. Many people said it was a habit of his own beforehand, (which it was), however, he ensured he did it ""a lot more to keep his performance consistent"".', u'The character of Reese is an allusion to The Riddler, who attempts to reveal the identity of Batman. Much like Edward Nygma whose name sounds like ""enigma"" (as in E. Nygma), Mr. Reese sounds like ""mysteries"".', u'Despite endless speculation on which actor had been chosen to portray The Joker, Heath Ledger had always been among Christopher Nolan\'s foremost choices for the role. Ledger and Nolan had met during the Batman Begins (2005) casting process for the role of Bruce Wayne/Batman, but Nolan and Heath agreed Ledger was wrong for the part. When casting the part of the Joker, Nolan met with several other actors before Ledger, but found them reluctant to take the role because of the popularity of Jack Nicholson\'s performance in the original Batman (1989). Upon meeting with Ledger again, Nolan recognized him as the perfect choice for the part. When asked the reason for this unexpected casting, Nolan simply replied, ""Because he\'s fearless.""', u'This was the first comic book movie to reach the one billion dollar mark.', u""Blood is only ever seen three times on-screen: on the face of the civilian Batman that the Joker hangs, on Harvey's pillow in the hospital, and on Batman's arm due to the dog attacking him; most of the violence either occurs off-screen or is obscured by camera angles."", u'Cillian Murphy reprises his role as Dr. Jonathan Crane a.k.a. Scarecrow from Batman Begins (2005) in this film. This makes him the first actor to reprise the role of a Batman villain in the whole film franchise. He also reprises his role in a cameo in The Dark Knight Rises (2012).', u'Christopher Nolan and his co-writers, Jonathan Nolan and David S. Goyer, made the decision very early on not to explore The Joker\'s origins. This was so the character could be presented as an ""absolute"".', u'The Batman theme is heard only twice in the film, as composers Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard decided that a heroic theme that a viewer could hum would overlook the complexity and darkness of the character. Hearing the tune only twice would create what Zimmer calls ""a musical foreshadowing.""', u""According to Christopher Nolan, Bruce Wayne's reasons for needing a new Batsuit (to be faster and more agile) were, in fact, the real reasons why Nolan wanted the Batsuit to be redesigned for this film."", u'This is the first Batman movie where Batman operates outside of Gotham.', u""Heath Ledger's posthumous Best Actor in a Supporting Role Oscar win, marks the first time an Academy Award has been awarded, in a major category, to a comic book movie."", u'The infamous growl performed by Christian Bale was much rougher in this film than Batman Begins (2005), and has been parodied countless times due to its extreme nature, however, the common misconception is that Christian Bale was fully responsible for this voice. The real voice, during filming, was more toned down, and then heightened to a rougher, grittier vibe during post-production under the decision of Christopher Nolan.', u'During the chase scene, when the Joker takes over driving the semi after his driver is killed, the bullet holes on the windshield form a smiley face.', u""Heath Ledger posthumously won a total of 32 Best Actor in a Supporting Role awards for his work on this film, including the Oscar, Golden Globe, BAFTA, SAG, and Critics' Choice award.

After watching \'The Dark Knight\', Goyer stated ""I can\'t believe my name is on a movie this good"".', u'Aaron Eckhart described his portrayal of Harvey Dent as simultaneously coming from, and being apart from, the same world as Batman (Dent is the white knight of Gotham, as opposed to the Dark Knight).

Yet we only see The Joker load 4 bags onto the bus. Lau later tells the mobsters around the table that they were robbed of $68 million dollars. A million dollars in $100 dollar bills weighs 22 pounds, meaning: if the bags are loaded evenly in multiples of a million, each bag would have contained $17 million dollars and would have weighed in excess of 350 pounds/bag.', u'Nestor Carbonell who plays the Mayor of Gotham City, also played a parody of Batman, named Batmanuel in the television series The Tick (2001).', u'Batman overhears a call between the Joker and the 911 operator where the Joker says ""Eighth and Orchard.

Batman received ""Tails,"" the ""bad"" side; at the end of the film, he asked Gordon to blame all of the city\'s troubles on him, resulting in the Batman\'s reputation being disgraced and scorned. On the other hand, both Gordon and Harvey received ""Heads,"" the ""good"" side, and were both honored as heroes at the end of the film.', u'During the Hong Kong action scene (to bring Lau back), Batman shoots time-bombs on the glass which has a time of 2:22 minutes. The bombs explode almost exactly after 2 minutes 20 seconds in real-time, which shows that the action could happen in almost two minutes.', u'The Joker only looks at three of the people he kills in the film. He shoots the bus driver while looking back at the hostages. Two of Gambol\'s thugs he stabs while looking up. He kills Gambol while looking at another thug. He throws the cigar lighting Lau on fire and turns to talk to The Chechen as Lau dies. The three he looks at are the thug he kills with a pencil, the policeman stopping the semi-truck before the chase, and the policeman that is clearing the hospital out which he shoots with a pistol while in a nurse uniform. This character choice is a reference to the graphic novel ""The Man Who Laughs"" in which it is mentioned that The Joker ""just opened fire and didn\'t even look at the people while he killed them"".', u""The address 250 52nd Street where Rachel Dawes is killed, and where Harvey Dent brings Gordon's family is a palindrome: it's the same forwards as it is backwards. The way it's framed with a zero in the middle and the same numbers in opposite directions on either side suggests the opposite sides of Dent's favorite coin, the two sides of his face, and by extension the duality of his nature."", u'In Batman (1989) Batman uses the grapple gun on the Joker, causing him to fall to his death. In this film, Batman also uses the grapple gun on the Joker, this time to save him from falling.', u""When Harvey Dent's face is on fire, the first frame reveals the Batman logo on his close-up."", u'Christopher Nolan asked Aaron Eckhart not to perform any tics or slurping noises as Two-Face to make the character less ""showy"".', u'Bruce Wayne makes his final appearance in the film (out of the batsuit) a whole forty minutes before the end of the movie, when he is reacting to the sound of Gotham General Hospital exploding shortly after his car accident.', u""Early in the film, a witness on stand pulls a gun out on Harvey Dent a.k.a. Two-Face during the trial and tries to shoot him. This is a nod towards Two-Face's original origin story in the comics, where in a similar trial scenario, crime boss Sal Maroni is on stand and throws sulfuric acid in Dent's face resulting in his scarring."", u'There are many elements from various Batman graphic novels, either verbatim or slightly recast. In The Long Halloween, Batman, Gordon, and Dent fake Dent\'s death; in The Dark Knight, Gordon\'s death is faked. Also in The Long Halloween, Batman poses as a SWAT officer; in the movie, Gordon does. The Joker\'s reference at the end of the film to pushing Dent over the edge, mirrors his social experiment with Gordon in The Killing Joke, in which The Joker attempts to drive Gordon insane by making him have a really bad day. A lot of the interaction between Batman and The Joker is taken from The Long Halloween, specifically the interrogation scene in the film, which is also is similar to elements of The Dark Knight Returns. The copycat Batmen are clearly inspired by The Sons of The Batman from The Dark Knight Returns. Finally, in The Killing Joke, the Joker explains if he ""had a past, it would be multiple choice."" This is referenced when the Joker tells two different stories about the origin of his scars.', u'The infamous interrogation scene originally ended with Batman, after getting the information he needs from the Joker and dropping him on the ground, quickly kicking the Joker in the head right before he leaves to save Rachel, almost as an afterthought. However, this part was removed in editing, because Christopher Nolan felt the action seemed ""a little too petulant for Batman"".', u""After his transformation, Two-Face flips his coin eight times. It comes up on the good side five times for the Joker, Sal Maroni, Detective Ramirez, Dent himself, Gordon's son (though Two-Face didn't catch that one) and the bad side three times, for Detective Wuertz, Maroni's driver, and Batman."", u""The film uses numerous elements of the Joker's first appearance in Batman #1, published in 1940. In both The Dark Knight and Batman #1, the Joker publicly announces his crimes before committing them, removes his make-up and disguises himself as a police officer to gain access to a person he threatened to kill, uses a powerful bomb smuggled into jail to escape, steals and kills not for personal gain but simply to create chaos and disorder, and infringes upon the city's old-fashioned mobsters."", u'This is the only film in the Dark Knight trilogy, where there is not a surprise revelation as to who was the instigator of the criminal events, and the identity of a villain. This is also the only film in the trilogy where the League of Shadows does not play an active part in the plot.', u'Body count: 36.', u'In the original Batman comics (specifically, Detective Comics #80, 1943) the surname of the plastic surgeon who attempts to repair Two-Face is ""Ekhart"". In this movie, Two-Face is, of course, played by Aaron Eckhart.', u""The Joker's fate, at the end of the film, was left ambiguous. This is in line with the comics, as Joker would routinely be presumed dead to end a story, only to see him return in later stories very much alive."", u""Harvey Dent's scarring in this film, due to an explosion, is not what happens in the comics, but rather is closer to the Batman: The Animated Series (1992) episodes Two-Face Part I and II."", u""The camera angle shooting up at The Joker as he beats Batman with a pipe is reflective of the graphic novel scene in the Batman series 'A Death In The Family', in which The Joker beats up Robin (Jason Todd) with a crowbar."", u""Christopher Nolan has said that if he knew he was going to make another sequel, Harvey Dent wouldn't have died."", u'In all three films of the Dark Knight trilogy, Batman/Bruce Wayne has the last on-screen conversation with Jim Gordon only.', u""In this film, despite his name, Joker only performs three actions that could pass for jokes...the smoke bomb in the bank, the pencil trick, and his fake seductive greeting to Harvey Dent while in the nurse's outfit. (He also claps sardonically when Gordon is appointed Commissioner of Police, and throws his hands up in mock despair when the hospital he targets (Gotham General) doesn't immediately go up in flames.)"", u'In the final fight in the tower, after Batman pulls Joker up by a cable - right before the police officers arrive to arrest Joker, he hits the camera while giving his monologue and waving around with his arms, you can see the screen view shaking for a moment.', u""The Bat Symbol at the beginning of each film in the trilogy foreshadows something that happens later. In this case the Bat Symbol is made up of fire and it symbolizes Harvey Dent's face being burned which later turns him into Two-Face."", u'In Batman Forever (1995), Harvey Dent a.k.a. Two-Face falls to his death when he flips his coin. The same things happens in this film.', u'The Joker says that Rachel is located at Avenue X and Cicero. Cicero is a prominent street in Chicago (where a lot of the movie was filmed) located at 4800 West (48 blocks from State Street).', u'The Joker and Batman share numerous scenes, however the Joker and Bruce Wayne never share a scene.', u'All of the main action in this film takes place over nine days and nights, by far the shortest time span of the Dark Knight Trilogy (Batman Begins (2005) takes place over decades, and The Dark Knight Rises (2012) - even when removing the flashbacks that elongate its time span to decades - still covers many months within the main action). The only scenes in the film that are implied to take place outside of these nine days and nights are the brief flash-forwards in the final scene of Harvey Dent\'s funeral (which would probably not take place for at least one week) and Gordon breaking the bat signal. The ""day"" with the most screen time in the film is the final day, which covers forty-eight minutes (a full third of the total runtime). Furthermore, unlike the other films of the trilogy, which contain copious flashbacks, this film only contains one flashback, when Harvey Dent remembers flipping his coin to Rachel while lying in his hospital bed. With that flashback, The Dark Knight not only becomes the only film in the trilogy where Bruce Wayne does not have a flashback, but also the only film where the content of the flashback references a previous scene within the film\'s main action. The flashbacks of the other films all either reference moments that take place outside of the film\'s main action (e.g. a flashback to Wayne\'s childhood), or moments that, while being part of the main action, are shown for the first time in the flashback.', u'Harvey Dent does not appear fully transformed as Two-Face until nearly 102 minutes into the film.', u""Composer James Newton Howard composed an elegant and beautiful score for Harvey Dent, which would serve as a jarring contrast to Two-Face's persona."", u'The hospital that the Joker blows up, was actually an old, out-of-use candy factory in the Chicago suburbs. It was redressed and imploded for the film.', u""In each part of the trilogy Batman/Bruce Wayne has either a friend who turns into the villain, or vice versa. In this one, Harvey Dent a.k.a. Two-Face is an ally of Bruce Wayne, then afterwards opposes Batman, blaming him for Rachel's death, and his transformation."", u'In the ""Two ships"" game theory scenario, the Joker is seen with all three of the Chechen\'s dogs. In Greek Mythology, Cerberus is the ""hound of Hades\', who guards the gates of Hell, and is usually is presented as a three-headed dog. Though this may come off as purely coincidental, the Joker\'s deeds and personality are emblematic of Pluto, Lucifer, and other demonic entities, and the image of him with three dogs, gives that notion further validation.', u'When Dent discusses Gotham\'s politics and referencing Ancient Rome, Rachel brings up Julius Caesar, which leads Dent to saying ""You either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain"". In Shakespeare\'s ""Julius Caesar"", the titular character is portrayed to be a man of notable ignorance, whose ""partial deafness"" implies that he only listens to that which he deems relevant, rather than being an open-minded leader. In the aftermath of Harvey Dent\'s transformation into his ""Two Face"" persona, he loses his sense of reason, instead, only discussing matters that relate to Rachel\'s murder and his ""betrayal"" by Gordon and the Batman. When Batman ""kills"" him for crossing the line, it almost mirrors Brutus\'s slaying of Caesar, a man who was his friend, but was no longer serving his people the way he swore to.', u'The only movie in the trilogy where the phrase ""The Dark Knight"" is spoken. It is said at the near end of the movie where Batman is escaping from the police and Jim Gordon is talking to his son.', u""The masks that the Joker and his partners wear at the beginning of the movie during the bank robbery are the exact same as the masks that Joker and his henchmen use in his first appearance on the 60's series."", u'At 6\'1"", Heath Ledger is the second tallest Joker, after Cesar Romero\'s 6\'3"", and before Jack Nicholson\'s 5\'9"".', u'At the fund raising party, Bruce remarks about Harvey\'s previous campaign slogan ""I believe in Harvey Dent"". He then says, ""Look at that face"", which turns out to be ironic since Harvey later becomes a gruesome Two-Face villain that is hard to look at.']","[u'Argentina::14 July 2008 (Buenos Aires)\n (premiere)', u'USA::14 July 2008 (New York City, New York)\n (premiere)', u'Australia::16 July 2008', u'Taiwan::16 July 2008', u'Argentina::17 July 2008', u'Bolivia::17 July 2008', u'Chile::17 July 2008', u'Greece::17 July 2008', u'Hong Kong::17 July 2008', u'Malaysia::17 July 2008', u'Peru::17 July 2008', u'Philippines::17 July 2008', u'Singapore::17 July 2008', u'Thailand::17 July 2008', u'Uruguay::17 July 2008', u'Brazil::18 July 2008', u'Canada::18 July 2008', u'Colombia::18 July 2008', u'Indonesia::18 July 2008', u'India::18 July 2008', u'Mexico::18 July 2008', u'Panama::18 July 2008', u'USA::18 July 2008', u'Venezuela::18 July 2008', u'UK::21 July 2008 (London)\n (premiere)', u'Iceland::21 July 2008\n (premiere)', u'Denmark::22 July 2008', u'Belgium::23 July 2008', u'Egypt::23 July 2008', u'Iceland::23 July 2008', u'Italy::23 July 2008', u'United Arab Emirates::24 July 2008', u'Ecuador::24 July 2008', u'Finland::24 July 2008 (limited)', u'UK::24 July 2008', u'Croatia::24 July 2008', u'Ireland::24 July 2008', u'Israel::24 July 2008', u'Kuwait::24 July 2008', u'Lebanon::24 July 2008', u'Lithuania::24 July 2008', u'Netherlands::24 July 2008', u'New Zealand::24 July 2008', u'Portugal::24 July 2008', u'Serbia::24 July 2008', u'Slovenia::24 July 2008', u'Slovakia::24 July 2008', u'Bulgaria::25 July 2008', u'Estonia::25 July 2008', u'Finland::25 July 2008', u'Latvia::25 July 2008', u'Nigeria::25 July 2008', u'Norway::25 July 2008', u'Romania::25 July 2008', u'Sweden::25 July 2008', u'Turkey::25 July 2008', u'South Africa::25 July 2008', u'Germany::1 August 2008 (limited)', u'Japan::2 August 2008 (limited)', u'Poland::2 August 2008 (limited)', u'South Korea::6 August 2008', u'Czech Republic::7 August 2008', u'Hungary::7 August 2008', u'Poland::8 August 2008', u'Japan::9 August 2008', u'Switzerland::13 August 2008 (French speaking region)', u'Spain::13 August 2008', u'France::13 August 2008', u'Kazakhstan::14 August 2008', u'Russia::14 August 2008', u'Ukraine::14 August 2008', u'Austria::21 August 2008', u'Switzerland::21 August 2008 (German speaking region)', u'Germany::21 August 2008', u'Armenia::28 August 2008', u'Pakistan::10 October 2008 (Rawalpindi)', u'USA::23 January 2009 (IMAX version) (re-release)', u'Japan::24 January 2009 (re-release)', u'Brazil::6 February 2009 (IMAX version) (re-release)', u'Singapore::12 February 2009 (re-release)', u'Mexico::13 February 2009 (re-release)', u'South Korea::19 February 2009 (re-release)', u'Peru::19 February 2009 (re-release)', u'Hong Kong::24 September 2009 (re-release) (IMAX version)', u'Spain::31 January 2015 (Barcelona) (re-release)']",1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The bowl is actually on the table during the entire illusion. What you see before the illusionist covers it with a sheet is a tablecloth that is carefully arranged to look like the actual base of a table. A duplicate tablecloth is held in place by the bowl, collapsed upward into the actual table platform.

Also he wanted to write the script by obeying this principle so that the audience could braid together three story lines and they continually rise in anxiety and tensity. So as one story line is peaking, the other one is still to be built and the third is entering the last phase.', u'When asked why he cast Harry Styles in the film, Christopher Nolan said ""I auditioned literally thousands of young men with different combinations of young men.

Director Christopher Nolan explained that Bolton's character was a composite of several officers who performed heroically during the evacuation, but mostly Cmdr. James Campbell Clouston.

The Royal Canadian Navy was a fledgling service at the time, and it was not unusual for young Canadians who wanted to serve at sea the join the Royal Navy. Clouston did well as he advanced through the service, qualifying as a gunnery specialist, considered the cream of the navy. In 1937, he became captain of the modern destroyer HMS Isis, which was undergoing refit when Dunkirk broke in late May 1940. Clouston immediately volunteered to help, and he was appointed pier master in the beleaguered port. From all accounts he gave extraordinary service, working around the clock under the most demanding circumstances to evacuate as many soldiers as possible. He stayed until no more could be evacuated but was killed in the English Channel on his way back to England when the vessel he was on was attacked by enemy aircraft. In July 1940, Clouston was awarded a Mention in Despatches, the highest posthumous award for valour after the Victoria Cross."", u'This film marks the fifth collaboration between Cillian Murphy and Christopher Nolan.', u""In the film, many soldiers cursed the Royal Air Force for not protecting them from the Luftwaffe bombers. What is not mentioned at all is that the RAF was already out, attacking the bombers sent to bomb the soldiers on the beaches, and the bombers that did attack were only the ones that got past the fighters. These dogfights occurred more inland from Dunkirk, hence why the soldiers on the beaches didn't see many fighters during the evacuation, and why they thought the RAF had abandoned them."", u'According to director Christopher Nolan, the tension that he feels watching Saving Private Ryan (1998) was not the tension he wanted for Dunkirk (2017).', u'It is the first Christopher Nolan movie to be based on historical events.

After the war Runstedt tried to blame the Halt Order on Adolf Hitler.

Dunkirk has achieved the fourth biggest UK opening of 2017, behind Beauty and the Beast (2017), Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017) and Despicable Me 3 (2017).

These are the same type of goggles worn by Bruce Spence who played The Gyro Captain in The Road Warrior (1981) from the Mad Max films. Hardy played Max Rockatansky in Mad Max: Fury Road (2015).', u'Perhaps a tongue-in-cheek inside joke by the director: early on in the film, a trio of Spitfires overfly the yacht that is the center of one of the three stories. The owner, Mr. Dawson, says something to the effect of: ""The Rolls Royce Merlin engine. The best sound you can hear out there."" The Spitfires were powered by the Merlin. The Bf 109s of that era would have had Daimler-Benz engines. However, the Messerschmitts used in the film were not 1940-era aircraft. They were Hispano\'s, Bf 109s built by Spain under contact in the late 40s and early 50s. Rather than the sleek nose profile of the original Bf 109s, these planes have ""chin"", to accommodate their new engines, which were Rolls Royce Merlins. The inside joke? Regardless of which fighters flew by, the actual actors, not the characters they played, would have heard the sound of Rolls Royce Merlin engines.', u'Andrew Simpson was reportedly in talks for one of the main characters.', u'Dunkirk features the most footage shoot on 65mm IMAX film stock to date, with 79 minutes of the final cut being footage that was shot on said IMAX film stock. This beats out a previous Nolan film, The Dark Knight Rises, which had 72 minutes of its final cut being footage that was shot on said IMAX film stock.', u""In the sequence where the Spitfire ditches into the English Channel, an IMAX camera was strapped into the cockpit to film Jack Lowden's character trying to get out. However, during filming, the plane with the camera still inside sank quicker than predicted. It took so long to retrieve the plane that the IMAX camera housing filled with water, potentially ruining both the very expensive camera and the film inside. Director Christopher Nolan used an old movie technique of keeping the film wet and shipped it back to Los Angeles, and processed the film before it dried out. The take from that film is in the movie."", u'The film is told from three points of view: on the beach with the infantry (including Fionn Whitehead and Harry Styles), the evacuation by the navy (featuring Cillian Murphy and Mark Rylance, showing how civilians came to the rescue) and then in the air (with Tom Hardy engaging in plane combat). Speaking about the narrative structure in Premiere magazine, Christopher Nolan stated: ""For the soldiers who embarked in the conflict, the events took place on different temporalities. On land, some stayed one week stuck on the beach. On the water, the events lasted a maximum day; and if you were flying to Dunkirk, the British spitfires would carry an hour of fuel. To mingle these different versions of history, one had to mix the temporal strata. Hence the complicated structure; even if the story is very simple. Do not repeat it to the studio: it will be my most experimental film.""', u""The clock in the soundtrack doesn't stop ticking during the whole movie; until Alex and Tommy are sitting safely on the train."", u'The Mark Rylance character, Dawson, is closely based on Lightoller, Second Officer of the Titanic, who took his yacht Sundowner to Dunkirk at the age of 66. Like Lightoller he refuses to let the navy crew his boat - ""if anyone takes her it will be me"", and takes one of his sons with him. Like Lightoller, Dawson has lost a son in the RAF (Brian, shot down in a Wellington bomber on the second day of the war) who taught him how to evade air attack. Also like Lightoller he packs the boat so full (four stood in the bathtub), the disembarkation officer couldn\'t believe over 55 men were aboard Sundowner.', u'In researching the Dunkirk true story, History vs Hollywood discovered that while the character Farrier is not directly based on an actual person, his experience most closely resembles that of Alan Christopher ""Al"" Deere, a New Zealand Spitfire pilot. Farrier\'s fictional experience is indeed similar. After shooting down several German planes, he too is forced to crash-land east of Dunkirk, likely on a Belgian beach. Unlike Deere, Farrier is captured in the closing shots. Deere famously got back to England after punching a naval officer in the face when he refused to let the RAF on board. During his combat career Al was shot down nine times, surviving all incidents to then go on to write his autobiography \'Nine Lives\'.', u""Despite the fact that the Germans are shooting at and bombing the allied forces throughout the film, no German troops are actually visible until one of the last shots in the movie, and even then they're out of focus and in shadow."", u'The distinctive sound of planes that bombed the beach is comes from the Junkers Ju-87 Sturzkampfflugzeug ""Stuka"" dive bombers. The sound did not come from its engine nor its propeller, in fact it comes from sirens mounted upon the leading edges of its faired main gear legs, so called Jericho-Trompete (""Jericho trumpet"") which terrorized ground troops and becomes a propaganda of German air power during WWII. The Stuka dive bombers were the only aircraft equipped with such a siren system, but has became a characteristic sound of planes diving down/attacking.', u'Near the end of the film, a Spitfire without fuel is seen shooting down a Stuka dive-bomber. This is historically correct - the Stukas were notoriously easy targets for fighter planes (especially when preparing to dive) and, in the following Battle of Britain, suffered high casualties.', u'The only German soldiers seen in the film are the ones who capture Farrier at the end of the film. They are shown out-of-focus.', u""Among the British Infantry, only Tommy and a few soldiers firing at German planes are shown using their rifles.

Nolan also cited the Steven Spielberg films, Jaws (1975) and Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977), as films that manage to tackle serious subject matters, while still appealing to all audiences as examples for him to emulate. Nolan and his crew studied the IMAX documentaries of NASA by Toni Myers, for visual reference of space-faring missions, and sought to mimic the look of her use of IMAX cameras aboard spaceships.

As the scene cuts to Professor Brand, you can see the same thing on a different pillar on the left. This word continues to be obvious throughout the entire scene.

Franklin and his team at Double Negative. Thorne provided pages of deeply sourced theoretical equations to the team, which then created new CGI software programs based on these equations to create accurate computer simulations of these phenomena. Some individual frames took up to one hundred hours to render, and ultimately the whole CGI program reached to eight hundred terabytes of data. The resulting visual effects provided Thorne with new insight into the effects of gravitational lensing and accretion disks surrounding black holes, and led to him writing two scientific papers--one for the astrophysics community, and one for the computer graphics community.', u""The Wormhole is placed near Saturn as a reference to 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), because Stanley Kubrick originally planned for part of that movie to take place at Saturn.

The first known reference to the term in science fiction literature occurred in Robert A. Heinlein\'s 1941 short story ""And He Built a Crooked House."" In the story, an architect designs a house based upon the geometric concept of a four-dimensional analogue of the cube. He does this so well, that the house folds in upon itself and creates a dimensional loop within the structure. People within the house can see themselves by looking through one room into another which is, in fact, the room they are in and find it nearly impossible to leave, as they are in a loop, much like what Coop saw when he entered the black hole.', u""Although Doyle is presumed drowned after being struck by the tidal wave on Miller's planet, his suit appears intact when the Ranger leaves, meaning it is remotely possible he could have survived the impact, and is merely unconscious.

Coined by Charles Howard Hinton in 1888 in his book ""A New Era of Thought,"" the tesseract is a structure that extends a normal cube into four dimensions. It was popularized in Robert A. Heinlein\'s short story ""--And He Built a Crooked House"" from 1941, and later in the 1962 science fiction novel ""A Wrinkle In Time"" by Madeleine L\'Engle.', u""Many of the characters' names are found on the books in Murph's room as authors."", u""The escape method from the black hole, using the space ships jointly as thrusting power (and then leaving only one thrusting ship behind for Hathaway's character), resembles the escape method in the movie 2010 (1984) (from one of Jupiter's changing moons)."", u""The original script of the Steven Spielberg version of this film depicts an almost entirely different movie. Some examples include Murph being a boy, no humans are first sent into space (probes are) and a probe leads Cooper to the hidden NASA base, which is on a remote island in California where Brand and Cooper deep-sea dive for parts. Also, the robots are much more human-like, featuring hands and shoulders. TARS is sucked into space early on when the ship gets stuck between two black holes (Gargantua and Pantagruel--two French mythical giants) immediately after entering the wormhole. Afterwards the crew, including an additional member named Roth, only visit the ice planet, where they discover that a Chinese mission had been there some thirty years prior, and seemed to have vanished, until it is learned that they were killed by the radiation of a neutron star. The crew falls through the ice into an entirely different ecosystem with a living rearranging forest and colonial organisms that fight each other every night, compounding into larger organisms to reach a higher spot closer to the ice sky for sunlight in the day. After searching the area, they find an abandoned Chinese camp with an experimental black box that can control gravity nearly at will, and are then discovered by Chinese robots who sabotage their return home with the box. The crew orbits a black hole (lasting hundreds of Earth years) before entering a second wormhole where they interact directly with the fifth dimension bulk beings who lead them to a four thousand-year-old space station built by the Chinese that's only a few hundred years old, due to space-time relativity, powered by a captured mini black hole that views galaxies as flat, lines of light. The Chinese have built thousands of worm holes, and tried to travel back in time with the gravity technology to save all of Earth, but died in the process. Cooper returns to Earth, in the year 2230, to find a barren land with ice storms. He sits down prepared to die in the storm, then awakens in a manner similar to the movie, where he meets his great-great-grandson, rather than an aged Murph. After being bored with the current world, Cooper steals a ship to find Brand (the two had been intimate before Brand parted Cooper, to continue to explore space rather than return to Earth)."", u'When the TARS robot and Romily are repairing the KIPP robot on Dr. Mann\'s planet, TARS warns, ""get back, professor, get back!"" Right before KIPP detonates, you can faintly hear it say, ""please don\'t make me . . . "" Light is shed on what this means, in Christopher Nolan\'s since-released comic ""Absolute Zero,"" an account of Dr. Mann\'s and KIPP\'s survey of the planet.', u'One of the books visible on Murph\'s shelf is David Wroblewski\'s ""The Story of Edgar Sawtelle"". This book hints at key plot points, where the title character, who also lives on a farm, is aided in solving a mystery through the help of his deceased father\'s ghost.', u""The first Christopher Nolan film where Sir Michael Caine's character dies."", u'When Cooper exits the wormhole back to Earth\'s solar system, the scene resembles the ""star child"" scene from Stanley Kubrick\'s 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), which is referenced several times in this film.', u'The tesseract scene (which looks like a giant library, and allows Cooper to access his daughter\'s bookshelf in the past) bears some resemblance to the concept of L-space as described in Terry Pratchett\'s ""Discworld"" books. L-space (short for Library space) is the principle that the mass of information contained in a large collection of books warps space and time, and in consequence a sufficiently large library allows the visitor to access any library anywhere in space and time.', u""Cooper and Donald sit on their porch before Cooper's departure drinking what appears to be beer, despite the fact that all crops except for corn (including ostensibly hops and barley, ingredients in beer) are not able to be grown."", u""In spite of TARS' humorous line about never leaving Dr. Brand behind, that's exactly what happens near the end when he is jettisoned into the black hole, Gargantua."", u'When inside the tesseract, during the black hole sequence, one of the books on the bookshelf is James Ellroy\'s ""The Big Nowhere"" - clearly an allusion to where Cooper is at that moment.', u'The scene near the end, when Cooper travels out of the tesseract, back through the wormhole, and touches Brand\'s hand resembles Michelangelo\'s ""Creation of Adam"" painting in the Sistine Chapel.', u'In the scene where Cooper has to land their ship on Miller\'s water planet, the camera focuses on him gripping the seat of his chair. This is a reference to a common aviation saying, ""Fly by the seat of your pants."" Before modern instruments, pilots relied on instinct and their senses to fly, such as sight, using landmarks to gauge altitude or distance. Pilots also used feeling from the vibrations in their seat from air hitting the plane to determine windspeed and direction. Cooper verifies this when he said he needs to ""feel the air"" in order to land properly instead of relying on technology.', u""On-screen body count: Four. Several characters also die off-screen by the end of the film: Donald, Romily, Jesse (Tom's firstborn son, possibly from dust-related respiratory problems), and most likely Tom, as he is never mentioned, nor seen during Cooper's time on the space station, at the end of the film."", u'Toward the end of the movie, when Cooper is walking toward the copy of his house on the space station, a series of screens on his path depict people narrating their past experiences on Earth. On the very last screen, for an instance, you can see someone who looks vaguely like Arthur C. Clarke, the writer of 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968). This is not actually Clarke, and is in fact one of the people featured from the The Dust Bowl (2012) footage, possibly selected because of the resemblance.', u'The spaceship near the end of the film resembles the spaceship in the Arthur C. Clarke novel ""Rendezvous with Rama"", a fifty kilometer (thirty-one mile) cylindrical alien spaceship, that can also carry a human colony to the stars.', u'Dr. Mann emphasizes to Cooper, that before he dies, he will see his children, foreshadowing his actual reunion with Murph.', u'The first of two movies in which Matt Damon has played a stranded astronaut stuck on another planet, the other being The Martian (2015).', u""In Timestalkers (1987), an historian researches clues of time travel in the past (from a remote, plausible future) which leads him to a top-secret military base and hangar.

William Devane acted in both films."", u'While Coop takes down time at (the orbital replica of) his homestead, the surroundings are curved upwards in M\xf6bius-like angles. Elysium (2013) - which also starred Matt Damon - had a similar, human settlement apart from Earth.', u""Casey Affleck and Matt Damon previously co-starred in the films Chasing Amy (1997), Good Will Hunting (1997), Gerry (2002), as well as the Ocean's trilogy."", u""The film's main villain, Dr. Mann, played by Matt Damon, is the only villain created by Nolan who is not part of the film's main conflict."", u'When Cooper wakes Dr. Mann, he says, ""You literally raised me from dead,"" to which Cooper replies, ""Lazarus."" The ""Lazarus Pit"" was a major location in The Dark Knight Rises (2012), a film directed by Christopher Nolan.', u'When Cooper tries docking onto the spinning Endurance, CASE tell him ""this is no time for caution."" Consequently, the score Hans Zimmer titled for this scene is called ""No Time for Caution.""', u'When Dr. Mann fails to dock perfectly, and the Endurance explodes, the pod that exploded may have significance. When looking at images of Endurance, it traditionally has the ""arm"" in the 3:00 position of the clock face the ship represents. The exploded pod therefore is at 10:00. This is interesting, as this is the tenth film Christopher Nolan has directed.

Cavill refused to take steroids to muscle up for the role. He also refused any digital touch-ups or enhancement to his body in his shirtless scenes. He said it would have been dishonest of him to use trickery while playing Superman, and he wanted to push his body to the limits, to develop his physique into one that was worthy of the character.', u'Henry Cavill said that the most difficult part of making the movie, was definitely his two shirtless scenes. He had been training for months prior to filming, but for his shirtless scenes, he went on an extremely difficult diet and training regimen in which his calorie intake was cut from five thousand to nearly fifteen hundred for six weeks. After six weeks, he reached a body fat level of just seven percent, the level achieved by professional body-builders during competitions. Henry said he did this because he wanted to make his abs as pronounced and his muscles as defined as humanly possible, to create the best possible Superman physique. Cavill returned to a more manageable routine after the scenes were shot, but felt his effort was rewarded when audiences and critics alike praised his physique for the true embodiment of what Superman would look like. After he had shot his shirtless scenes, director Zack Snyder gave him a tub of ice cream and pizza to reward him for his Herculean effort for the shirtless scenes.', u'The film released in June 2013, the 75th anniversary of Superman.', u'Henry Cavill and Russell Crowe had met years prior to playing father and son when Henry was an extra in Proof of Life (2000), and received words of encouragement to pursue acting, and an autographed picture from Crowe, who was his favorite actor.', u'The idea that Superman\'s S-Shield means ""hope"" is taken from Mark Waid\'s ""Superman: Birthright"" comic: the S-Shield is the Kryptonian symbol for ""hope"", and Superman (1978) created the concept of the Shield being a Kryptonian herald for the house of El.', u'In an early Smallville scene near the Kent house, a double tanker truck passing by in the background bears the ""LexCorp"" brand name. Also, a building in Metropolis and a tanker truck later bear the name as well. This is the company run by Superman\'s arch rival, Lex Luthor.', u'Henry Cavill naturally has a hairy chest, and left it untouched for the shoot of this movie. He insisted that Superman has chest hair in this film; he rejected the notion that just because you are muscular, you should not have chest hair, and cited the Superman comic book ""The Death Of Superman"" as being an iconic representation, in which Superman had a hairy chest.', u'Clark\'s line ""Can\'t I keep pretending I\'m your son?"", and Jonathan\'s response, ""You are my son"", are taken from ""Superman: Secret Origin"" by Geoff Johns.', u'Rumors say that Zod\'s broadcast to Earth is made in several languages including the ""Star Trek"" Universe\'s Klingon, but there is no proof for this.', u""Zack Snyder said that he really wanted to include a shirtless scene of Henry Cavill in the film, because throughout the film, you see him in a form-fitting body suit where he appears extremely muscular. He said the audience would think it was all rubber muscles, but it was important to show them it was indeed Cavill's body in that suit, and that it was all real."", u""In the final fight scene between General Zod and Superman, Bruce Wayne's logo and company name (Wayne Financial) can be seen on the satellite that is destroyed during combat."", u'Henry Cavill embarked on a special four-month training regimen by his trainer Mark Twight to get the appropriate physique for his roles as Kal-El. He gained weight by drinking five one thousand-calorie protein shakes a day, then he did cardiovascular workouts to burn away the fat, and build muscle, and finally, he underwent a grueling two-hour workout to build up his muscles and abdomen. According to Cavill, the real problem he faced was the workout\'s intensity: ""Mark based his technique on going beyond yourself. Instead of slowing down towards the end of the workout, he asked me to actually work harder and harder for the body to reach its limits. His point was that if his client is able to walk out of the gym, he had not worked hard enough.""', u'Ben Affleck turned down directing the film, because he wasn\'t experienced in visual effects shots: ""A lesson I\'ve learned is to not look at movies based on budget, how much they\'ll spend on effects, or where they will shoot. Story is what\'s important."" He appeared as Batman in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016), which was directed by Zack Snyder.', u'When Clark is first learning to fly, he is only able to make a few gigantic bounds. In the first few Superman comics in 1938-9, he was not able to fly, but could only leap 1/8 of a mile like a high-powered kangaroo. The first cartoons and movies decided that this looked undignified, and made him fly, which looks more majestic, even though physics give no logical reason for him to have this ability.', u'According to Zack Snyder, the filmmakers outfitted Henry Cavill in the Superman (1978) costume to see how well he fit the role. Despite the outfit bearing a lighter blue color and red trunks, no one laughed at Cavill. Snyder knew then that Cavill was right for the role.', u'Amy Adams (Lois Lane) is only nine years younger than Diane Lane (Martha Kent).', u'According to David S. Goyer, Superman\'s costume is defined in this film to be an undergarment: ""All the battle armor goes on top of the suits. But since Superman\'s a refugee, his outfit doesn\'t have that gear, and would make him defenseless on his own Kryptonian turf."" This is also a nod to pop culture\'s running joke that Superman\'s costume appears to be underwear.', u'The filmmakers hired Professor Christine Schreyer, an expert in anthropology and linguistics at British Columbia, to create the Kryptonian language. She developed an object-subject-verb sentence structure, contrasting the subject-verb-object structure of English (for example, ""I see him"" in English would be ""Him I see"" in Kryptonian), to reflect that people on Krypton had become selfish and materialistic.', u""Matthew Goode, Armie Hammer, Matt Bomer, Joe Manganiello, Zac Efron, and Colin O'Donoghue were on the final shortlist for the lead role. Henry Cavill was finally cast. He was the front runner to play Superman in another Superman movie (working title: Flyby) but the movie failed to be greenlit, and Brandon Routh was cast in Superman Returns (2006) instead. Cavill was also a runner-up to Daniel Craig for the James Bond role in Casino Royale (2006), Christian Bale for Bruce Wayne a.k.a. Batman in Batman Begins (2005)."", u""This is Amy Adams' third time auditioning for Lois Lane. She first read for Lois Lane in Brett Ratner's abandoned film, then for Superman Returns (2006). Adams has stated that it became ridiculous, and this time she had to play Lois and put her stamp on it."", u'During Jor-el and Kal-El\'s first conversation and 3-D history of Krypton, Jor tells Kal about how he was sent away. In the background, a pod with the ""S"" and spikes can be seen flying away. This is not the way it looks in this movie, but in fact how it appears in Superman (1978).', u'To completely distinguish this film as a new film separate from previous ones, the iconic ""Superman Theme"" by John Williams wasn\'t heard. This is the first Warner Brothers Superman film to not incorporate Williams\' score.', u""Costume Designer Michael Wilkinson said that while the Superman suit emphasized and highlighted Henry Cavill's muscular physique, for the scenes where he is playing Clark Kent, they tried to hide his physique by giving him layers of clothing, and baggy clothes so that he could blend in more. Only in one scene, does Clark wear a form-fitting t-shirt, which reveals that he is powerfully built, but that is when he is with Martha, who knows his identity."", u'This is the first live action Superman movie not to feature the character Jimmy Olsen. Not only was the Jimmy Olsen character in every live action Superman movie prior to Man of Steel (2013), but he was also in Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman (1993), Smallville (2001), and Supergirl (1984). Jimmy Olsen also appears in Supergirl (2015).', u'Superman\'s Kryptonian family name ""El"" is one of the Hebrew names for God, one of many savior allusions in the character\'s mythos. This comes from the original comic writers Jerry Siegel and Joe Schuster, who, being Jewish, would have been familiar with this trivia as part of their cultural heritage.', u'Distributed to theaters under the title ""Skyrim"".', u'According to David S. Goyer, the story\'s major theme is first contact: ""We approached Superman as if it weren\'t a comic book movie, as if it were real. He\'s an alien. If the world found out he existed, it would be the biggest thing that ever happened in human history. Just his existence would change the face of the Earth forever.""', u""When Clark talks to Father Leone, there is a stained-glass window behind him, which contains a painting of Christ in the garden of Gethsemane. This was where Christ prayed for strength to undergo the ordeal he will face, and parallels Clark's own need for support before his surrender."", u'When Superman learns to fly, he has a short flyover towards the camera. This is an homage to previous movies, in which Superman would fly over the Earth, and then smile at the camera.', u'The visual effects team described the Kryptonian computer displays as liquid geometry: ""It\'s a bunch of silver beads suspended through a magnetic field; the machine is able to control that magnetic field, so that the collection of beads behave like 3-D pixels, and create a surface that floats in the air and describes whatever the thing is you\'re supposed to be seeing.""', u'Bryan Singer and Brandon Routh expressed interest in reprising their positions from Superman Returns (2006) on this film. Singer had originally outlined several sequels to follow his story, and Routh was contracted as well. When Warner Brothers announced this film as a ""clean reboot"" from Singer\'s film, Routh still expressed interest in returning, before Zack Snyder declared that this movie would have no ties to any previous cinematic incarnation of the character.', u""According to the comics, General Zod's first name is Dru."", u""Zack Snyder originally planned for the infamous red trunks that Superman has worn throughout his 75 year existence, to be part of the suit in the movie. However, when looking over 1,500 different designs, he said that it just didn't work, so he decided to take them out."", u'Composer Hans Zimmer and Zack Snyder used what they considered the best drummers in the world to perform on the film\'s musical score. Zimmer created a single drum track for all of the drummers to play at the same time, but encouraged them to maintain their own unique styles. The drummers included Danny Carey, Pharrell Williams, Josh Freese, Sheila E., Jason Bonham, Toss Panos, Satnam Ramgotra, Matt Chamberlain, John Robinson (a.k.a. John ""J.R."" Robinson), Jim Keltner, Bernie Dresel, Curt Bisquera, Ryeland Allison, Vinnie Colaiuta, and Trevor Lawrence, Jr.', u'In a flashback scene, in which Clark Kent is being bullied, he is seen reading ""The Republic"" by Plato. In ""The Republic,"" Plato describes his ""Perfect Society,"" which mirrors the make-up of Kryptonian society as given here. Most obviously, both societies have preordained births, in which people are born into roles, such as leaders, warriors, or farmers.', u'While coming up with the aesthetic of how the Superman physique should look, trainer Mark Twight said the he wanted the classic V shape - broad shoulders and narrow waist, which Henry Cavill naturally had, he just had to pack on more muscle to his frame. Additionally, he said he looked to Steve Reeves\' physique in Voittamaton Herkules (1958) as a model for Superman, as to attain a Greek God ideal. Zack Snyder instructed Henry Cavill, that his physique should look so great that in his shirtless scenes, he had to look like a ""freak"", and be in ""absolutely crazy shape"". Zack Snyder was subsequently very impressed with the results of Henry Cavill\'s eleven month hard training, and called his physique ""a great accomplishment"". Henry Cavill said that even he was surprised by how big he looked in the film.', u'Gal Gadot was originally cast as Faora, but had to drop out due to her pregnancy, and Antje Traue was cast in her place. Gadot would later be chosen play Diana Prince a.k.a. Wonder Woman in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016) and in the subsequent Wonder Woman (2017) and Justice League films.', u'Henry Cavill is the first non-American actor to play the role of Clark Kent. The now deceased, London-born Lee Quigley played Superman as a baby, in Superman (1978).

In 1991, many thought overpasses were safe, after a highly publicized video of a television film crew and several others taking shelter under an overpass, during a tornado near El Dorado, Kansas, survived, although the overpass did not take a direct hit. However, in 1999, during the deadly Moore and Bridge Creek, Oklahoma F-5 tornado, several people were killed seeking shelter in overpasses, prompting the National Weather Service, and other weather agencies to proclaim them as unsafe. Ironically, the Moore, Oklahoma area got hit by another deadly tornado about a month before the theatrical release of this film, prompting Zach Snyder to consider removing the tornado scene from the movie, although he ultimately kept it, as Superman would have had to deal with all manners of disasters and tragedies.', u""When Jor-El escapes the Council, there is a shattered moon can be seen in the sky.

Peters insisted on Superman fighting a giant mechanical spider, supervillain Braniac fighting a polar bear, and so on (much to the frustration of Smith, Warner Brothers executives, and DC executives. They even asked Smith to work around it, by calling the mechanical spider something different, according to Smith). Eventually Smith left, and Peters went on to make Wild Wild West (1999), featuring a giant mechanical spider.

Also, in the same scene, Clark is bullied by a gang led by Whitney Fordham, a character who was inspired by Whitney Fordman, another character created for the show as Lana Lang\'s boyfriend in season one. - The Smallville barbershop is named ""Otto\'s Barber Styling"".

He ultimately decided it was disrespectful to Heath Ledger."", u'While doing promotional interviews for the film, Tom Hardy stated that the most difficult parts of the movie to shoot were the fight scenes. Not because of the physicality of them, but because he was such a huge Batman fan growing up, that he said ""it felt like I was beating up my childhood hero"". However, he also said that despite his worship of the character, the moment Christopher Nolan yelled ""Action""!, Hardy just started throwing punches as hard as he could.', u'When Bruce Wayne traces the fake fingerprints that the Catwoman was wearing when she cracked his safe, the result shows a ""Nikolai Ondrejko"".

He was verbally told that he would have unprecedented access to extensive stunt training and equipment that he could enjoy knocking around.', u'When Selina Kyle disappears from a rooftop, Batman\'s remark ""So that\'s what that feels like"" is lifted directly from the DC graphic novel ""Kingdom Come"". Even the circumstance is similar, except it was with Superman.', u'Anne Hathaway has said that she desperately coveted the role of Catwoman, and was a complete nervous wreck after her audition. The first time her agent phoned after her screen test, he said he had good news and asked if Hathaway was sitting down. Hathaway immediately screamed ""I\'m Catwoman!"" and ran around the room in a frenzy. Unfortunately, her agent had to calm the actress down--he had called to let her know that she\'d been invited to host the Academy Awards. Hathaway has said she was so shocked she went numb at the offer. Fortunately, shortly thereafter, her agent phoned again to let her know that she had been offered the part of Catwoman as well.', u'According to Christopher Nolan, Bane was chosen as the film\'s main antagonist ""to test Batman mentally as well as physically.""', u'Christopher Nolan wanted Marion Cotillard so much for the role of Miranda Tate, that he modified the filming schedule to accommodate her pregnancy. When Nolan invited Cotillard for the film in 2010, she told him that she was pregnant, and didn\'t know if she would be able to do it, but Nolan decided to keep her in the film. Cotillard started filming just one month after giving birth, and Nolan also made room on-set for her family. In the last months of filming, Cotillard also shot another film at the same time in France, Rust and Bone (2012). She was flying back and forth between the U.S. and France to shoot both movies. During an interview for Vogue in August 2012, Nolan marveled at Cotillard\'s ability to do her job so soon after giving birth, calling it ""amazing to see"" and describing her as ""Superwoman"".', u'To prepare for his role as Bane, Tom Hardy gained thirty pounds in weight, and studied various fighting styles to use in the film.', u'Bane\'s theme is a chant which features the term ""deshi basara"", which is Moroccan for the word ""rise"".', u'Tom Hardy has several large tattoos on his chest and arms that had to be covered using heavy cake makeup for the film.', u'Christian Bale is the first actor to portray Batman/Bruce Wayne in three Batman films.', u'Out of respect for Heath Ledger, the Joker is never once mentioned for the whole film.', u'When Jonathan Crane first appears as the ""sentencing judge,"" he is wearing a heavily tattered coat that looks like it has straw coming out of the shoulders. This is a clear nod to his alter ego, Scarecrow.', u""During the motorcycle chase scene, Bane is wearing a red helmet with black visor as well as a brown motorcycle jacket. This is the original costume Jason Todd took under his Red Hood persona, which is itself a callback to The Joker's original criminal identity."", u'A close look on the handheld walkie-talkies used by the Gotham City Police Dept reveals an old DC Comic logo.', u'Dr. Jonathan Crane a.k.a. Scarecrow, played by Cillian Murphy, is the only villain to appear in all three of the Dark Knight films.', u'Each movie from the Dark Knight trilogy is twelve minutes longer than the previous one, (Batman Begins (2005) is 140 minutes, The Dark Knight (2008) 152 and The Dark Knight Rises 164).', u'To prepare for her role as Catwoman, Anne Hathaway worked out five days a week on a regimen that involved vigorous exercise, stunt training and dancing. She called it her most physically demanding role to date.', u""At one point it was rumored that the Penguin was to have been featured as one of the film's major villains, and would have been played by Philip Seymour Hoffman. Christopher Nolan quickly denied the rumors, saying that the character would have been difficult to adapt for his version of Batman."", u""When Bane rips the photo of Harvey Dent in half he does so vertically through the middle of Harvey's face, replicating his transition to Two-Face at the end of The Dark Knight (2008)."", u""Bruce Wayne's doctor visit, in which the doctor lists off all the degenerative injuries to his body (lack of cartilage, scar tissue, et cetera) and the use of a mechanical knee brace, both are reminiscent of Mark Waid's Justice League novel Kingdom Come (set in a hypothetical future), where an older Bruce Wayne requires the use of an exoskeleton to move, due to years of physical wear and tear on his body."", u'Christian Bale personally dyed part of his hair, to make Bruce Wayne look somewhat older.', u'In the football stadium sequence, the cast and extras are all wearing heavy winter clothing, though the scenes were shot during a massive heat wave across the East Coast during the summer of 2011.', u'This is the first Batman movie created by Christopher Nolan that did not get an Academy Award nomination, and the second Batman film (after Batman & Robin (1997)) which did not receive a single nomination.', u'After the Bane team robbed the Stock Exchange, The chasing scene contains a shot of the tablet which counting down from 91 seconds at 47:40. And the scene ended at 49:10. The chasing sequence has exactly 90 seconds time period.', u""Selina's method of escaping Wayne Manor, is highly reminiscent of tall tale involving one of Catwoman's inspirations, Hedy Lamarr, whom Anne Hathaway studied for the role. Lamarr claimed she escaped her possessive Austrian arms dealer husband by dressing as one of her maids, collecting all her jewelry, and jumping out a window."", u'At 165 minutes long, this is the longest Batman film released to date as well as the second longest film that Christopher Nolan has ever directed. Interstellar (2014) is his longest at 169 minutes.', u""Anne Hathaway has revealed that during her audition, she thought that she was auditioning for The Joker's on again-off again girlfriend/partner-in-crime Harley Quinn. it was only after she had a discussion with Christopher Nolan, that she found out that she was auditioning for Catwoman."", u'During one of the scenes involving the kangaroo court, Bane can be seen sitting in the rear of the courtroom quietly knitting. Given the numerous allusions to Charles Dickens\' ""A Tale of Two Cities"" in the film, this is presumably an allusion to Madame Defarge and her practice of knitting while watching public guillotine executions.', u'During Bane\'s first encounter with Batman, Bane\'s footsteps on the steel grating of the walkways produce loud, heavy thuds while Batman\'s footsteps make little sound at all. This was done by the sound effects team to further contrast Bane\'s ""brute"" style from Batman\'s ""stealth"" method of combat.', u'When Officer Blake talks about ""giant alligators"" being in the sewer line, this may be an intentional nod towards Batman villain Killer Croc, whom Bane out-wrestled to become head of Gotham\'s gangland.', u'According to Costume Designer Lindy Hemming, she took two years to design Bane\'s coat; it was inspired by a Swedish army jacket, and a French Revolution frock coat, to make Bane look equally dictatorial and revolutionary, ""like an amalgam of all sorts of bits and pieces he cobbled together as he passed through some very remote places.""', u'Tom Hardy described Bane as an absolute terrorist: ""He\'s brutal, but also incredibly clinical, in the fact that he has a result-based and oriented fighting style. The style is heavy-handed, heavy-footed... it\'s nasty. It\'s not about fighting, it\'s about carnage!""', u""The Batsuit consisted of 110 separate pieces. The base layer was made of a polyester mesh, utilized by the military and high-tech sports manufacturers due to its breathability and moisture-retaining properties; molded pieces of flexible urethane were then attached to the mesh to form the overall body armor plating. Carbon fiberpanels were placed inside the sections on the legs, chest and abdomen. The cowl was sculpted from a cast of Christian Bale's face and head to become a perfect fit for Bale."", u'In designing the Batwing, Production Designer Nathan Crowley approached it as if it were an actual military project, emphasizing the need for it to ""fit into the same family as the Tumbler and the Batpod"": he incorporated designs from military aircraft, including the Harrier Jump Jet, Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey and the Boeing AH-64 Apache.', u'Cillian Murphy holds the record for the most frequently appearing Batman villain, he has played the evil Dr. Jonathan Crane a.k.a. Scarecrow in all three Batman films in this version.', u""As with the previous two movies, Bruce Wayne's main car is a Lamborghini. (Batman Begins (2005): Lamborghini Murci\xe9lago Roadster, The Dark Knight (2008): Lamborghini Murci\xe9lago LP640, The Dark Knight Rises: Lamborghini Aventador LP 700-4.)"", u'The nickname ""Catwoman"" is never spoken in the movie; rather newspaper articles and police files refer to her as ""The Cat."" This is in keeping with the original incarnation of the character (not yet named Selina Kyle) who was a jewel thief, and was known only as ""The Cat"" before becoming ""The Catwoman.""

While some took it at face value (that Bruce survived and Alfred really saw him), others thought that Bruce was dead, and saw the caf\xe9 scene as a non-literal fantasy nod to Alfred\'s stated wish from earlier in the movie that Bruce might be able to someday find peace, and a normal life. In a December 2012 interview with the Los Angeles Times, Sir Michael Caine seemed to settle the question when he said that Bruce was supposed to be unambiguously alive during the scene: ""They were there....They were real. There was no imagination. They were real and he was with Anne Hathaway (who played Selina Kyle), the cat lady, and I was happy ever after for him as I told him during the picture."" Furthermore, the film\'s shooting script also specifies, that Bruce is alive during the caf\xe9 scene.

Goyer, as outlined before the production of Batman Begins (2005), was to have Two-Face as the principal antagonist for the film. Initially, at the end of The Dark Knight (2008), the Joker would have scarred Harvey Dent at a courtroom trial, setting up the third film. Dent\'s death and fall was put in at the end of the second film instead, to set up the aftermath that follows. Following the release of this film, Nolan elaborated on his choice to include the Two-Face story in the prior film: he wanted each movie to stand on its own as a complete story, and not ""tease"" any sequels--a practice that had become common amongst comic book films. Nolan feels that holding back story or leaving a film open-ended for a sequel, on which to build, is a cheat to the audience, which deserves to see a movie that has consumed all of the filmmakers\' creative energy.', u'It is shown in flashbacks that Bane was still an adult when Miranda was a child. Tom Hardy, who plays Bane, is two years younger than Marion Cotillard, who plays Miranda.', u'When Batman is chasing after Bane for the first time, after the stock exchange robbery, an older policeman tells his younger partner to ""sit back, you\'re in for a show"". This is an almost direct quote from the graphic novel ""Batman: The Dark Knight Returns.""', u'Between Fox, Alfred, Blake, and Gordon, only Blake and Gordon do not discover that Bruce Wayne/Batman survived.', u'In the comics, Bane carried an apparatus that contains a steroid that amplifies his strength and fighting ability. In the film, the apparatus he carries contains an anesthetic, as he is in chronic pain. In both the comics and the film, Batman defeats Bane in a similar way, by damaging his mask, depriving him of the drug.', u'In addition to the numerous elements from the ""Knightfall,"" ""The Dark Knight Returns,"" and ""No Man\'s Land"" storylines, the film also borrows from the ""Legacy"" storyline, which involves Bane becoming Ra\'s Al Ghul\'s successor and plotting with the League of Shadows to destroy Gotham City.', u'This is the only live-action Batman film, where the Bat-signal is never used.', u""According to The Hollywood Reporter, Anne Hathaway's stunt double broke one of the IMAX cameras when she crashed the Batpod into it. This marks the second time an IMAX camera has been destroyed on a Christopher Nolan Batman film - a previous camera was smashed when filming the Joker's underground truck chase in The Dark Knight (2008)."", u'Eva Green, Naomi Watts, Rachel Weisz, and Kate Winslet were considered to play Miranda Tate, before Marion Cotillard finally got the role in February 2011, when she was six months pregnant. Cotillard started filming one month after she gave birth to her son, Marcel. In October 2010, it was reported that she had turned down the roles of Catwoman and Talia Al Ghul in the film, but as of 2016, there is no official confirmation that she was considered to play Catwoman.', u""John Blake's real name, Robin, is an allusion to the character in Batman comic books, movies, and television shows. Robin was added to the Batman comic books in 1940, to attract younger readers, and the character eventually evolved into a solo superhero, Nightwing. Blake, though an original character, combines elements of the various Robins from the comics - an orphan (like Dick Grayson), a street kid (like Jason Todd), and a skilled detective who deduces Batman's true identity (like Tim Drake), all of whom trained as Batman's sidekick, with the implication that they one day would don the Batman costume."", u'According to Jonathan Nolan, a major influence on the story is Charles Dickens\'s socio-political novel ""A Tale of Two Cities"", which dealt with revolution and class conflict. In an homage to the story, two characters in the film are named Stryver and Barsad, after two similarly named characters in the book. Also, when Commissioner Gordon gives a eulogy for Bruce, he uses the ending soliloquy in regards to Batman, who, like the novel\'s hero Sydney Carton, sacrificed himself to save people.', u""The coloring and shading of the cloth draping the Batman Memorial Statue during its unveiling was similar to the blue colors of Batman's costume as traditionally seen in the comics."", u""In each part of the trilogy, Batman/Bruce Wayne has either a friend who turns into the villain or vice versa:    -Batman Begins (2005): Ra's Al Ghul trains Bruce Wayne, and then turns against him.    -The Dark Knight (2008): Harvey Dent a.k.a. Two-Face is an ally of Bruce Wayne, then afterwards, opposes Batman, blaming him for Rachel's death, and his transformation.    -The Dark Knight Rises (2012): Catwoman/Selina Kyle initially steals from Bruce Wayne (Lamborghini and necklace), then tricks him into Banes underground hiding. Near the end she sides with Batman over Bane.    Also, Miranda is initially an ally of Bruce Wayne and Wayne Enterprises. Near the end, she reveals herself to be a villain all along."", u'Though not shown in the final cut, the fight scene on Gotham City Hall steps, included an explosion that cleared the steps of all the fighters still alive. When filming the actual explosion, the heat triggered a fire alarm, that went directly to the authorities; which caused production to stop for more than thirty minutes, while the film staff cleared everything with the police and Fire Marshal when they arrived.', u'The filmmakers cite the ""Batman"" comics \'The Dark Knight Returns\' (an aged Batman operates in a future Gotham), \'Knightfall\' (Bane pushes Batman physically and mentally, causing him to burn out) and \'No Man\'s Land\' (Gotham descends into post-apocalyptic gangland territory, and is cut off from the rest of the U.S.) as major influences on the film.', u'This marks the second trilogy of movies in which Liam Neeson plays a character who is killed in the first movie, only to subsequently return incorporeally to communicate with a central character in a later movie (the other trilogy being the Star Wars prequels.)', u""Despite being portrayed by Caucasian actors in The Dark Knight Trilogy, the Batman comic books associate Ra's Al Ghul and his daughter Talia Al Ghul with Arabic-Asiatic attributes, and Bane is almost consistently associated with Hispanic-Caribbean traits and origins."", u""The first Batman movie not to feature Batman driving the Batmobile. He only uses the Bat-pod and the Bat (flying vehicle). While several variations of Tumblers do make an appearance, they are all operated by Bane and his thugs, after they steal them from Wayne Enterprises' Applied Science Division, and these have a desert camouflage paint job, so it could be argued that the Batmobile doesn't make any appearance at all."", u'Christian Bale and Sir Michael Caine spent several weeks filming exterior shots of Wayne Manor at Wollaton Hall, Nottingham, but Christopher Nolan just used one shot of Bale as Batman, in silhouette on the roof, and one shot of Caine at the gravesite.', u'This, and the other live-action Batman film to feature Bane as a villain, Batman & Robin (1997), show the Batman logo during the opening sequence freezing, and then cracking.', u""When the fusion reactor is first introduced in the bunker, the design is almost identical to the microwave emitter design that Ra's Al Ghul stole from Wayne Enterprises and brought into the city in Batman Begins (2005)."", u'It is always alluded that Bane is the child that escapes from The Pit by the use of non-specific terms such as simply ""a child"" rather than ""young boy"" or ""young girl"" and the character having a shaved head. This allusion is fed back to Bruce in the form of the hallucination of Ra\'s Al Ghul.', u""When Officer Blake mentions giant alligators in the sewers, this is a reference to Killer Croc (who makes his big-screen debut in Suicide Squad (2016)). In the comics, Killer Croc has clashed with Bane, the main villain. Bane broke both of Croc's arms, before fighting Batman and breaking his back."", u""The same musical cue is used in all three movies of The Dark Knight Trilogy when Batman deals the final blow to his main adversary. All three of these moments involve gravity getting the best of the villain. The train careens off the tracks in Batman Begins (2005) with Raz Al-Ghul inside. The Joker falls off the Pruitt Building in The Dark Knight (2008), and Talia Al'Ghul drives off the upper level of Grand Avenue in The Dark Knight Rises (2012)."", u""When Bane enters the stock exchange trading floor, he wears a backpack that has a logo 'DCS courier services.'

In Batman Begins, we assume Ducard to be killed in the falling monorail carriage, but do not see his body. In The Dark Knight, we do not know if the Joker was killed at all, thereby making Bane the only primary villain seen dying on-screen.', u'Batman tells Blake to get as many Gothamites out of the city before the bomb goes off, that ""We need an exodus"". Christian Bale later played Moses in Exodus: Gods and Kings (2014), based upon the biblical book of Exodus.', u'One major hint that the child is not Bane is the fact that the protecter of the child has the same build size and fighting skills that Bane uses throughout the film.', u""In the football scene, the surviving player has the name Ward on his shirt. In the Batman (1966) television series, Robin was played by Burt Ward. The surviving player's real-life name is Hines Ward."", u'In this film Marion Cotillard\'s character is trying to destroy the city using the atomic bomb.

""In trying to write a team-based creative process, I wrote the one I know,"" said Nolan.', u'In an effort to combat confusion, television broadcasts in Japan include text in the upper-left corner of the screen to remind viewers which level of the dream a specific scene takes place in.', u""In spite of the film's extensive surreal effects sequences, the majority of visual effects throughout the film, such as the Penrose stairs, rotating hallway, mountain avalanche, and zero-gravity sequences, were created through practical methods, not through the use of computer graphics imagery.

However, it was not yet written at the time, and Nolan determined that rather than writing it as an assignment, it would be more suitable to his working style, if he wrote it as a speculation script, and then presented it to the studio whenever it was completed. So he went off to write it, thinking it would take ""a couple of months"", but it ultimately took nearly eight years.', u'Joseph Gordon-Levitt performed all but one of his own stunts during the fight scene in the spinning hallway.', u'According to Cinematographer Wally Pfister, Warner Brothers executives approached Christopher Nolan about making the film in 3-D, but he refused the idea, claiming ""it will distract the storytelling experience of Inception"".', u'Joseph Gordon-Levitt went to his audition after a brief character summary, wearing a full suit ""just in case"", unknowingly matching his character\'s wardrobe perfectly.', u'During production, details of the film\'s plot were kept secret. Christopher Nolan, who wrote the script, cryptically described it as a contemporary science fiction action thriller ""set within the architecture of the mind.""', u""Christopher Nolan has said that the snow-based third-level dream was inspired by his favorite James Bond film On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1969)."", u'It took ten years for Christopher Nolan to write the screenplay for this movie.', u""Just like Christopher Nolan's previous movie The Dark Knight (2008), no second unit team was hired for making the movie.

The line is a reference to the title of a famous cognitive semantics book, \'Don\'t Think of an Elephant\' by George Lakoff. The book describes conceptual framing, the use of certain words to literally insert certain ideas about a subject into the listener\'s mind in a surreptitious way, e.g. implanting the idea that taxes are a bad thing by using the phrase ""tax relief.""', u'The role of Saito was written exclusively for Ken Watanabe, because Christopher Nolan felt that although he had appeared in Batman Begins (2005), he did not have much screen time, and should therefore be given a more prominent supporting role.', u'""Yusuf"" is the Arabic form of ""Joseph"", the Biblical figure from Genesis 37-50, who had the gift of interpreting dreams.

Dom is the word for \'home\' in most Slavic languages (e.g. Russian and Croatian), derived from the Latin word ""Domus"". Words like ""domesticated"" and ""domicile"" all share the same ""dom"" root.', u'One of the reasons why Christopher Nolan cast Tom Hardy as Eames was because of his performance in the film RocknRolla (2008).

Cobb, an American architect notable for designing skyscrapers. The world Cobb and Mal made in Limbo consists mostly of skyscrapers.', u'A direct translation of the lyrics for the song ""Non, je ne regrette rien"" as performed by \xc9dith Piaf is: ""I regret nothing/no, I have no regrets/I regret neither the good things that were done to me nor the bad things/They are all the same to me/...The past is payed, swept away, forgotten/I don\'t care of the past anymore/I set my memories on fire/My agonies, and my pleasures/I don\'t need them any more/Swept away in the agonies of love/Swept away forever, I\'m restarting with nothing..."" Christopher Nolan has made a point of saying that he chose the song specifically for the movie, which is heavily concerned with the effect of memories on the psyche, and specifically the disastrous effect that not letting go of memories of love-gone-wrong can have on the subconscious--exactly what the song discusses. Also of note: in the original French, ""I regret neither the good things done to me nor the bad things"" is ""Ni le bien qu\'on m\'a fait ni le mal,"" and since Cobb\'s wife is named Mal, that gives the line a double meaning.', u""Kate Winslet was approached for the role of Mal, but turned it down, citing that she couldn't see herself as the character."", u'In the city scene on the first level of the dream with Fischer, the state motto on the license plates of the cars reads ""The Alternate State"".', u'The \xc9dith Piaf song ""Non, je ne regrette rien"" is used as a plot device. Marion Cotillard played Piaf in La Vie en Rose (2007). Christopher Nolan has stated that this is ""pure coincidence"". After Cotillard was cast, Nolan intended to change the song to eliminate speculation on the subject, but composer Hans Zimmer persuaded him to keep it.', u'Despite prominent billing, Sir Michael Caine only gets three minutes of screentime.', u'Marion Cotillard\'s character is named \'Mal\', which is short for \'Malorie\', a name derived from the French word \'malheur\', meaning misfortune or unhappiness. The shorter version \'mal\' means wrong/bad or evil (when a noun) in French, as well as some other Latin-based languages. Years after starring in Inception, Cotillard starred in the French film Kaikki mit\xe4 rakastimme (2016), whose original title is ""Mal de Pierres"" (Stone Pain/Stone Ache).', u'Ariadne, in Greek mythology, was the daughter of King Minos of Crete and his queen, Pasipha\xeb. She aided Theseus in overcoming the Minotaur by giving him a ball of red fleece thread that she was spinning, so that he could find his way out of the Minotaur\'s labyrinth. The myth was also the basis for Richard Strauss & Hugo von Hofmannsthal\'s opera ""Ariadne auf Naxos,"" a play within a play, just as the movie is about a dream within a dream.', u'The ""Penrose stairs"" (with a woman perpetually picking up papers) that Arthur shows Ariadne is a reference to a lithograph print by the Dutch graphic artist M.C. Escher. The print is usually called ""Ascending and Descending"" or ""The Infinite Staircase"", and was first printed in March 1960; Escher is well-known for his drawings exploring optical illusions and real architectural, mathematical, and philosophical principles rendered in fantastical ways.', u'Marion Cotillard, Tom Hardy, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Cillian Murphy, and Sir Michael Caine returned to work with Christopher Nolan in The Dark Knight Rises (2012).', u'While shooting the snowmobile chase there were intermittent wind gusts. In order to preserve continuity during the takes without natural wind the camera helicopter was used to blow snow into frame.', u""Just as Cillian Murphy's character was named Robert Fischer as a tribute to champion chess player Bobby Fischer, his father's (Pete Postlethwaite) character is named Maurice Fischer as an homage to artist M.C. Escher (full name Maurits Cornelis Escher), whose art was clearly an inspiration for many of the visual effects in the film."", u""Christopher Nolan's first film since his feature debut, Following (1998), that is a completely original work. All of his films between them are either remakes or based on comics, novels, or short stories."", u'The running time of the movie on DVD is exactly 8888 seconds.', u'A series of numbers keeps appearing: the number that Fischer gives Cobb/Arthur is 528491, The two hotel rooms used are rooms 528 and 491, the number that Eames (as a woman) gives to Fischer is 528-491, the combination to the strongroom starts with 52, and the combination to the safe is 528-491. This is all to reinforce the importance of the number throughout the film. Mathematically, the number 528491 is a prime number.', u'Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy co-starred in The Revenant (2015), but this time playing enemies. DiCaprio convinced Hardy to read the script, and do the film with him.', u""The exterior of Fischer's snow fortress is based on, and actually contains some elements of, the Geisel Library at the University of California, San Diego, designed by famed futurist architect William L. Pereira."", u'Contrary to popular belief, Hans Zimmer did not compose the music that appears in the third trailer for this film. The track, titled ""Mind Heist"", was actually composed by Zack Hemsey.', u'The only characters that call Dom Cobb by his first name are Mal (Marion Cotillard) and Miles (Sir Michael Caine).', u'Inception is one of the top fifty highest grossing films of all time. (2015)', u'When Cobb and Miles are first shown, Cobb mentions ""Extradition between France and the United States is a bureaucratic nightmare."" In Catch Me If You Can (2002), Leonardo DiCaprio\'s character is arrested in France and later extradited to the United States.', u""The labyrinthine style of the movie's logo resembles the logo of Christopher Nolan's production company Syncopy."", u'The IMAX 65mm format was earlier considered, as used in The Dark Knight (2008), but it was eventually ruled out due to extensive hand-held camera usage throughout the shoot. Due to its weight, it cannot be operated hand-held.', u'The theme music for the movie, composed by Hans Zimmer, is named Time.', u'Eames is named after Charles Eames and Ray Eames, a married couple well known in the fields of furniture design, buildings architecture and avant-garde/documentary filmmaking.', u'There is a series of numbers that keep appearing, on the front of the train the number is 3502 and the taxi number is 2305.', u'There are a total of five Academy Award nominees in the cast: Tom Berenger, Tom Hardy, Pete Postlethwaite, Ken Watanabe, and Ellen Page, and three Academy Award Winners: Leonardo DiCaprio, Sir Michael Caine, and Marion Cotillard.', u'Before Ellen Page was offered and accepted the role, Christopher Nolan considered casting Evan Rachel Wood, Emily Blunt, Rachel McAdams, Emma Roberts, Jessy Schram, Taylor Swift, and Carey Mulligan.', u'Prints of the movie were shipped to theaters under the name ""Hour Glass"".', u'When Cobb is on the plane, and is given his passport, the face seen in the photograph is actually that of Christopher Nolan.', u'James Franco was in talks with Christopher Nolan to play Arthur, but was ultimately unavailable, due to scheduling conflicts.', u'This is the fourth of seven Christopher Nolan movies, in which Sir Michael Caine appeared. The others are: Batman Begins (2005), The Prestige (2006), The Dark Knight (2008), The Dark Knight Rises (2012), Interstellar (2014), and Dunkirk (2017).', u'The film uses University College London as a location for a number of scenes, including when Miles introduces Cobb to Ariadne. Not only did Nolan study at the university, he has used it as a location for several of his other films, such as Batman Begins (2005) and The Dark Knight Rises (2012).', u'Except for Dom Cobb, Robert Fischer, and Eames, every other person working in the extraction job, including Saito, are never called by his or her second name in the whole film.', u""Mal's totem, a spinning top, is (probably) a reference to the Clifford D. Simak's story 'Ring Around the Sun' where the spinning top is used as a way to skip from one parallel Earth to another (by way of helping characters to concentrate)."", u'Early in the film, during Mal and Cobb\'s conversation in a room within Saito\'s estate, Mal comments on a painting in the background. Cobb replies stating that Saito ""is partial to postwar British painters"". This is referring to the artist, Francis Bacon. The painting, ""Study for Head of George Dyer"", is of his late lover, whom he painted long after Dyer\'s death to perpetuate his memory.', u'This is the fourth film starring Marion Cotillard to feature a song by \xc9dith Piaf. The previous were Chlo\xe9 (1996) and Love Me If You Dare (2003), both films have ""La Vie en Rose"" in the soundtrack, while Inception has ""Non, je ne regrette rien"". Cotillard won the Academy Award for Best Actress portraying Piaf in La Vie en Rose (2007).', u'In an interview with French website AlloCin\xe9 in 2016, Marion Cotillard stated that Mal is one of her favorite roles.', u""Former The Smiths guitarist Johnny Marr played the guitar on some of the film's soundtracks."", u""The barrel chairs in Saito's dining room were designed by Frank Lloyd Wright in 1937 for Wingspread, the Herbert Johnson house in Wisconsin. Saito sits at the head of the table in a copy of the Willow Chair designed by Charles Rennie Mackintosh in 1903. This further plays on the Architect theme that is prevalent throughout the movie."", u'Marion Cotillard and Ellen Page appear in this movie together. They were both nominated for the ""Best Actress"" category at the BAFTAs, and for the Academy Award in 2008. Cotillard for La Vie en Rose (2007), and Page for Juno (2007). Cotillard won both awards.', u'The longest commercial flight is not Sydney to Los Angeles.

The music of each Christopher Nolan movie he acts in is composed by Hans Zimmer, except The Prestige (2006), which had music by David Julyan.', u'The word ""Cobol"" from Cobol Engineering, the company Dom Cobb worked, is actually a high level language for business data processing.', u'The music for the third trailer is Mind Heist, composed by Zack Hemsey. He later released an EP ""Mind Heist"" in which each song has a different artwork. The change in the artworks (from a dark area with a rail to a train coming closer to revealing the scene was in a tunnel) is a reference to the scene where Cobb and Mal lay on a rail waiting for a train to come and kill themselves. The names of the songs also referenced this scene.', u'A sample of Leonardo DiCaprio and Marion Cotillard dialogue in the train scene (""You\'re waiting for a train..."") is featured on the song ""Far Away"" by nExow at minute 03:28.', u'In the film, the characters are from five different continents across the globe, performing a major heist. Cobb, Arthur, and Mal are from the U.S. (N. America). Cobb fetches Ariadne from Paris, France (Europe); Eames and Yusuf are from Mombasa (Africa). Saito is from Japan (Asia), and Fischer is from Australia.', u'Lukas Haas plays The Architect, the member of the team who designs the dreamscape i.e. the world of the dream. In Lathe of Heaven (2002) he plays George Orr - a draftsman (similar to an architect) whose dreams change reality.', u'This is the fourth of six movies in which Marion Cotillard played a femme fatale. The others are A Private Affair (2002), A Very Long Engagement (2004), The Black Box (2005), The Dark Knight Rises (2012), and Macbeth (2015).', u'One of Japan\'s famous ""Bullet Trains"" is seen early in the movie. This is a 700 Series Shinkansen on the Tokaido line from Tokyo to Osaka. Its distinctive ""duck bill"" nose and tail design helps to reduce the air piston effect as the train enters tunnels at speed.', u'The two mirror scene with the Droste Effect on the bridge in Paris is a reference to two other films also directed by Christopher Nolan - Memento (2000) and Doodlebug (1997).', u'The character Mal is one of the film\'s main antagonists; in Latin, the root word ""mal"" means ""bad"" or ""evil"".', u""This film has five actors and one actress that appeared in Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy.

Christopher Nolan and Heath Ledger used Bacon's artwork as a visual reference for the character of The Joker in The Dark Knight (2008)."", u'Ariadne is the name of a figure from Greek mythology who helped Theseus find his way out of the Labyrinth after killing the Minotaur.', u'This began filming under the working title of ""Oliver\'s Arrow"".', u'The cast contains several actors and actresses who started in movies and television as children: Leonardo DiCaprio first started appearing on television, including as a regular in Parenthood (1990) and Growing Pains (1985), as a young teen; Joseph Gordon-Levitt had his first television roles at age seven; by age ten, Ellen Page had started as a regular on the series Pit Pony (1999); and while still in kindergarten, Lukas Haas made his film debut in Testament (1983).', u'The running time of the movie is exactly 8888 seconds in the Blu-ray DVD.', u'When the crew arrives at Level One of Robert Fisher\'s dream, Yusuf is standing on a street corner in the rain. When Yusuf enters the car, Arthur and Eames tease him, because the downpour was the result of his need to urinate after drinking too much champagne, on the ten-hour flight to Los Angeles (""Couldn\'t have peed before you went under?""). Dileep Rao also plays Dr. Max Patel in Avatar (2009), and has a scene with Grace Augustine where she tells him, ""You see, they\'re just pissing on us without even the courtesy of calling it rain.""', u""The father of Robert Fischer is Maurice Fischer; Maurice Micklewhite is the birth name of Sir Michael Caine, who plays Stephan Miles, Cobb's father-in-law."", u""Leonardo DiCaprio, Marion Cotillard, and Ellen Page were all in the long list for a BAFTA nomination in 2011 for their performances in the film.

Sir Michael Caine, who plays his father-in-law, has a daughter named Dominique in real-life.', u'The song ""Non, Je ne Regrette Rien"", which is used as the wake up song, also plays the closing credits of the 2003 film ""The Dreamers"".', u""Miranda Nolan: Christopher Nolan's cousin appears as an air hostess."", u""Christopher Nolan: [Murphy's bag] The third Nolan movie in five years in which Cillian Murphy's character spends a significant portion of his on-screen time with a cloth bag over his head."", u'The slow, gloomy, blaring trombones in the main theme of the film score are actually based on an extremely slowed down version of the fast, high pitched trumpets in the beginning of the \xc9dith Piaf song ""Non, je ne regrette rien,"" which is used as a plot device in the film. Furthermore, when music is heard by someone who is currently within a dream, the music is perceived as slowed down. Thus, the main theme of the film score is almost exactly what the beginning of ""Non, je ne regrette rien"" would sound like to a dreamer. This thematic device is brought to its logical conclusion when the song plays at the end of the credits, signaling that the audience is about to \'wake up\' from the film.', u'During an interview, Christopher Nolan addressed the ambiguous ending, saying he believes Cobb makes it home to his children, although it is open to interpretation by the viewer. He further claimed that the point of not seeing whether or not the top stops spinning is that Cobb no longer obsesses over his dreams.', u""Not counting flashbacks, Cobb's wedding ring only appears in scenes where he is dreaming. Many times in the film, the scene cuts away just as Cobb's left hand comes into view."", u""Ariadne's hair is in a tight bun in the hotel sequence, so filmmakers didn't have to figure out how her hair should move in zero-gravity."", u""When Cobb gave Ariadne the puzzle test, Ariadne's final solution was a diagram of King Minos' Labyrinth. Ariadne is the name of King Minos' daughter in the same mythology."", u'When Cobb asks his kids what they have been doing at the end of the movie they answer (turn on captions), ""building a house on a cliff,"" referring one back to the beginning of the movie of Saito\'s house on a cliff. The movie explains to the audience the significance of Fischer\'s number in that it will subconsciously keep reappearing in dreams (e.g. the phone number, hotel rooms, safe combo); in light of this, the audience can watch the whole movie prepared and notice that the train that ran Cobb and Mal over in Limbo had a number on it. A combination of those numbers is used on the taxi cab that Mal and Cob get out of in the ""real world,"" as well as in their hotel room in the ""real world."" Suppose the whole movie was a dream. If it was, then Nolan cleverly made the movie exactly 2 hours and 28 minutes for a reason, the song continually played to wake people up ""from the dream"" is 2 minutes 28 seconds.', u'This was the last movie shot on film to win an Academy Award for Best Cinematography. All of the winners since were shot digitally until 2016, when La La Land broke the streak.', u'In the end, when Cobb uses his spinning top, the answer (Real vs. Dream) is foreshadowed, when he clears Customs earlier, and you briefly see his left hand as he hands over his passport.', u'Leonardo DiCaprio has stated in an interview, that in his mind, Cobb makes it out to the real world and his kids.', u'Cobb and Mal spent 50 years in limbo. At one point, it is stated that 10 seconds in the first dream world is 3 minutes in the next and 60 minutes in the dream after that. That equates to time increasing roughly 18 times each dream. Since Cobb was able to be in limbo within the 4th dream, if you break down the math, that equates to about 7.5 days for every 10 seconds. Breaking it down further, 50 years would be around 10.5 to 11 hours being asleep. This can be confirmed by the fact that Saito aged into an old man while in limbo during the duration of the flight to Los Angeles.', u'The narrative jumps between dream layers and/or story timeline a total of 223 times.', u'Although Tom Berenger appears in several scenes, the only scene where his character is ""real"" (That is, when he\'s not a projection of someone else\'s subconscious or being impersonated by Eames) is his first appearance in Maurice Fischer\'s office.', u'As Cobb gets off the train, he gives the reason that he hates trains, this is foreshadowing his and Mal\'s time together, as she always says, ""You are waiting for a train"", and that\'s what kills her in limbo, to take them back to real-life.', u'There are 399 questions asked in the film, including ""tag questions"" (i.e. - ""Subconscious is motivated by emotion, right?""). Cobb leads all characters with 113, followed by Ariadne (93), then Arthur (44).', u""Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) intentionally dreams, because he can't let go of his deceased wife.

(1989): ""Jack was like a clown figure, benign but wicked, maybe a killer old uncle. He could be funny and make you laugh. Heath\'s gone in a completely different direction to Jack, he\'s like a really scary psychopath. He\'s a lovely guy and his Joker is going to be a hell of a revelation in this picture."" Caine bases this belief on a scene where the Joker pays a visit to Bruce Wayne\'s penthouse. He\'d never met Ledger before, so when Ledger arrived and performed he gave Caine such a fright, he forgot his lines.', u""In preparation for his role as The Joker, Heath Ledger hid away in a motel room for about six weeks. During this extended stay of seclusion, Ledger delved deep into the psychology of the character. He devoted himself to developing The Joker's every tic, namely the voice and that sadistic-sounding laugh (for the voice, Ledger's goal was to create a tone that didn't echo the work Jack Nicholson did in his 1989 performance as the Joker). Ledger's interpretation of The Joker's appearance was primarily based on the chaotic, disheveled look of punk rocker Sid Vicious combined with the psychotic mannerisms of Malcolm McDowell's character, Alex De Large, from A Clockwork Orange (1971)."", u""Heath Ledger's sudden death from drug toxicity on January 22, 2008 prompted immediate speculation over the film's state and Ledger's disposition prior to death. Soon after Ledger's death was announced, Warner Brothers issued a statement that verified that Ledger had finished all of his scenes in principal photography, as well as post-production fulfillments (i.e., looping), thus making The Joker his final, completed film role. Rumors abounded that playing the intense role had taken its toll on Ledger's mental state, causing him to become depressed and take a wrong combination of drugs as a result. However, his family has since put such rumors to rest, by stating that far from being depressed, he had a lot of fun playing the role. Ledger did suffer from insomnia throughout his life, and would often take sleeping pills together with other prescription drugs (something his sister had actually warned against the night before his death). Unfortunately, the mix he took on that night proved to be a fatal combination."", u""Heath Ledger directed both homemade videos that the Joker sends to GCN himself. The first video involving the fake Batman, was done under Christopher Nolan's supervision. Nolan thought Ledger had done so well with that sequence, he felt there was no need for him to be there when it came time to film the scene where reporter Mike Engel reads the Joker's statement.

Ledger and Nolan had met during the Batman Begins (2005) casting process for the role of Bruce Wayne/Batman, but Nolan and Heath agreed Ledger was wrong for the part. When casting the part of the Joker, Nolan met with several other actors before Ledger, but found them reluctant to take the role because of the popularity of Jack Nicholson\'s performance in the original Batman (1989). Upon meeting with Ledger again, Nolan recognized him as the perfect choice for the part. When asked the reason for this unexpected casting, Nolan simply replied, ""Because he\'s fearless.""', u'This was the first comic book movie to reach the one billion dollar mark.', u""Blood is only ever seen three times on-screen: on the face of the civilian Batman that the Joker hangs, on Harvey's pillow in the hospital, and on Batman's arm due to the dog attacking him; most of the violence either occurs off-screen or is obscured by camera angles."", u'Cillian Murphy reprises his role as Dr. Jonathan Crane a.k.a.

He said that before lines were exchanged, Ledger would just walk around, in character, mumbling to himself in an odd manner. All Eckhart could do at the time, was just watch him while still in character. This went on for several minutes, until Ledger got close to him. Eckhart felt compelled at this point to fiercely raise his hand up. Immediately, Ledger grabbed Eckhart\'s raised hand in an equally matched fierce manner. When the scene was over, Ledger, now out of character, told Eckhart ""That\'s what acting\'s all about.""', u'Elaborate, interactive marketing campaigns were launched in the months leading up to the release of this film. One of these was an event at the 2007 San Diego Comic-con called Why So Serious, which involved fans following clues hidden around the city. The legions of Joker-painted fans ended up congregating in the street across from the convention center, where one of their numbers was welcomed into a black Escalade (with Gotham license plates) that had just pulled up. After a moment the fan started screaming and the SUV sped away. Later that day, a Gotham City newspaper was circulated reporting that a man believed to be the Joker was found beaten to death.

This Batsuit was an improvement on the outfit from Batman Begins (2005), and made Christian Bale more comfortable and agile in his performance. It was constructed from two hundred unique pieces of rubber, fiberglass, metallic mesh, and nylon (producing an impression of sophisticated technology), with elastic banding added for tightening the costume to fit Bale. The gauntlets had their razors made retractable and able to be fired. The suit's cowl was based on a motorcycle helmet and separated from the neck piece, allowing Bale to move his head left/right/up/down, and comes equipped with white eye lenses for when Batman turns on Bat-sonar."", u'The Joker make-up was composed of three pieces of stamped silicone, which took less than an hour to apply to Heath Ledger on each day of shooting. Ledger described it as ""new technology which is much quicker to apply than regular prosthetics""; he felt like he was not wearing any make-up at all.', u""In the film, Bruce asks Lucius Fox for a new Batman suit with a head piece that is 'easier to look around in'. This is a comical reference to older Batman films in which the actors playing Batman wore a suit that had a solid head piece covering the head, neck and shoulders. This made it impossible for the actors to turn their heads and instead had to turn their entire torso to look at their targets."", u""Unlike his counterpart in both the comics and Batman (1989), the Joker in this film does not have his hair and flesh permanently bleached by toxic waste.

The three he looks at are the thug he kills with a pencil, the policeman stopping the semi-truck before the chase, and the policeman that is clearing the hospital out which he shoots with a pistol while in a nurse uniform. This character choice is a reference to the graphic novel ""The Man Who Laughs"" in which it is mentioned that The Joker ""just opened fire and didn\'t even look at the people while he killed them"".', u""The address 250 52nd Street where Rachel Dawes is killed, and where Harvey Dent brings Gordon's family is a palindrome: it's the same forwards as it is backwards. The way it's framed with a zero in the middle and the same numbers in opposite directions on either side suggests the opposite sides of Dent's favorite coin, the two sides of his face, and by extension the duality of his nature."", u'In Batman (1989) Batman uses the grapple gun on the Joker, causing him to fall to his death. In this film, Batman also uses the grapple gun on the Joker, this time to save him from falling.', u""When Harvey Dent's face is on fire, the first frame reveals the Batman logo on his close-up."", u'Christopher Nolan asked Aaron Eckhart not to perform any tics or slurping noises as Two-Face to make the character less ""showy"".', u'Bruce Wayne makes his final appearance in the film (out of the batsuit) a whole forty minutes before the end of the movie, when he is reacting to the sound of Gotham General Hospital exploding shortly after his car accident.', u""Early in the film, a witness on stand pulls a gun out on Harvey Dent a.k.a. Two-Face during the trial and tries to shoot him. This is a nod towards Two-Face's original origin story in the comics, where in a similar trial scenario, crime boss Sal Maroni is on stand and throws sulfuric acid in Dent's face resulting in his scarring."", u'There are many elements from various Batman graphic novels, either verbatim or slightly recast. In The Long Halloween, Batman, Gordon, and Dent fake Dent\'s death; in The Dark Knight, Gordon\'s death is faked. Also in The Long Halloween, Batman poses as a SWAT officer; in the movie, Gordon does. The Joker\'s reference at the end of the film to pushing Dent over the edge, mirrors his social experiment with Gordon in The Killing Joke, in which The Joker attempts to drive Gordon insane by making him have a really bad day. A lot of the interaction between Batman and The Joker is taken from The Long Halloween, specifically the interrogation scene in the film, which is also is similar to elements of The Dark Knight Returns. The copycat Batmen are clearly inspired by The Sons of The Batman from The Dark Knight Returns. Finally, in The Killing Joke, the Joker explains if he ""had a past, it would be multiple choice."" This is referenced when the Joker tells two different stories about the origin of his scars.', u'The infamous interrogation scene originally ended with Batman, after getting the information he needs from the Joker and dropping him on the ground, quickly kicking the Joker in the head right before he leaves to save Rachel, almost as an afterthought. However, this part was removed in editing, because Christopher Nolan felt the action seemed ""a little too petulant for Batman"".', u""After his transformation, Two-Face flips his coin eight times. It comes up on the good side five times for the Joker, Sal Maroni, Detective Ramirez, Dent himself, Gordon's son (though Two-Face didn't catch that one) and the bad side three times, for Detective Wuertz, Maroni's driver, and Batman."", u""The film uses numerous elements of the Joker's first appearance in Batman #1, published in 1940. In both The Dark Knight and Batman #1, the Joker publicly announces his crimes before committing them, removes his make-up and disguises himself as a police officer to gain access to a person he threatened to kill, uses a powerful bomb smuggled into jail to escape, steals and kills not for personal gain but simply to create chaos and disorder, and infringes upon the city's old-fashioned mobsters."", u'This is the only film in the Dark Knight trilogy, where there is not a surprise revelation as to who was the instigator of the criminal events, and the identity of a villain. This is also the only film in the trilogy where the League of Shadows does not play an active part in the plot.', u'Body count: 36.', u'In the original Batman comics (specifically, Detective Comics #80, 1943) the surname of the plastic surgeon who attempts to repair Two-Face is ""Ekhart"". In this movie, Two-Face is, of course, played by Aaron Eckhart.', u""The Joker's fate, at the end of the film, was left ambiguous. This is in line with the comics, as Joker would routinely be presumed dead to end a story, only to see him return in later stories very much alive."", u""Harvey Dent's scarring in this film, due to an explosion, is not what happens in the comics, but rather is closer to the Batman: The Animated Series (1992) episodes Two-Face Part I and II."", u""The camera angle shooting up at The Joker as he beats Batman with a pipe is reflective of the graphic novel scene in the Batman series 'A Death In The Family', in which The Joker beats up Robin (Jason Todd) with a crowbar."", u""Christopher Nolan has said that if he knew he was going to make another sequel, Harvey Dent wouldn't have died."", u'In all three films of the Dark Knight trilogy, Batman/Bruce Wayne has the last on-screen conversation with Jim Gordon only.', u""In this film, despite his name, Joker only performs three actions that could pass for jokes...the smoke bomb in the bank, the pencil trick, and his fake seductive greeting to Harvey Dent while in the nurse's outfit. (He also claps sardonically when Gordon is appointed Commissioner of Police, and throws his hands up in mock despair when the hospital he targets (Gotham General) doesn't immediately go up in flames.)"", u'In the final fight in the tower, after Batman pulls Joker up by a cable - right before the police officers arrive to arrest Joker, he hits the camera while giving his monologue and waving around with his arms, you can see the screen view shaking for a moment.', u""The Bat Symbol at the beginning of each film in the trilogy foreshadows something that happens later. In this case the Bat Symbol is made up of fire and it symbolizes Harvey Dent's face being burned which later turns him into Two-Face."", u'In Batman Forever (1995), Harvey Dent a.k.a. Two-Face falls to his death when he flips his coin. The same things happens in this film.', u'The Joker says that Rachel is located at Avenue X and Cicero. Cicero is a prominent street in Chicago (where a lot of the movie was filmed) located at 4800 West (48 blocks from State Street).', u'The Joker and Batman share numerous scenes, however the Joker and Bruce Wayne never share a scene.', u'All of the main action in this film takes place over nine days and nights, by far the shortest time span of the Dark Knight Trilogy (Batman Begins (2005) takes place over decades, and The Dark Knight Rises (2012) - even when removing the flashbacks that elongate its time span to decades - still covers many months within the main action). The only scenes in the film that are implied to take place outside of these nine days and nights are the brief flash-forwards in the final scene of Harvey Dent\'s funeral (which would probably not take place for at least one week) and Gordon breaking the bat signal. The ""day"" with the most screen time in the film is the final day, which covers forty-eight minutes (a full third of the total runtime). Furthermore, unlike the other films of the trilogy, which contain copious flashbacks, this film only contains one flashback, when Harvey Dent remembers flipping his coin to Rachel while lying in his hospital bed. With that flashback, The Dark Knight not only becomes the only film in the trilogy where Bruce Wayne does not have a flashback, but also the only film where the content of the flashback references a previous scene within the film\'s main action. The flashbacks of the other films all either reference moments that take place outside of the film\'s main action (e.g. a flashback to Wayne\'s childhood), or moments that, while being part of the main action, are shown for the first time in the flashback.', u'Harvey Dent does not appear fully transformed as Two-Face until nearly 102 minutes into the film.', u""Composer James Newton Howard composed an elegant and beautiful score for Harvey Dent, which would serve as a jarring contrast to Two-Face's persona."", u'The hospital that the Joker blows up, was actually an old, out-of-use candy factory in the Chicago suburbs. It was redressed and imploded for the film.', u""In each part of the trilogy Batman/Bruce Wayne has either a friend who turns into the villain, or vice versa. In this one, Harvey Dent a.k.a. Two-Face is an ally of Bruce Wayne, then afterwards opposes Batman, blaming him for Rachel's death, and his transformation."", u'In the ""Two ships"" game theory scenario, the Joker is seen with all three of the Chechen\'s dogs. In Greek Mythology, Cerberus is the ""hound of Hades\', who guards the gates of Hell, and is usually is presented as a three-headed dog. Though this may come off as purely coincidental, the Joker\'s deeds and personality are emblematic of Pluto, Lucifer, and other demonic entities, and the image of him with three dogs, gives that notion further validation.', u'When Dent discusses Gotham\'s politics and referencing Ancient Rome, Rachel brings up Julius Caesar, which leads Dent to saying ""You either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain"". In Shakespeare\'s ""Julius Caesar"", the titular character is portrayed to be a man of notable ignorance, whose ""partial deafness"" implies that he only listens to that which he deems relevant, rather than being an open-minded leader. In the aftermath of Harvey Dent\'s transformation into his ""Two Face"" persona, he loses his sense of reason, instead, only discussing matters that relate to Rachel\'s murder and his ""betrayal"" by Gordon and the Batman. When Batman ""kills"" him for crossing the line, it almost mirrors Brutus\'s slaying of Caesar, a man who was his friend, but was no longer serving his people the way he swore to.', u'The only movie in the trilogy where the phrase ""The Dark Knight"" is spoken. It is said at the near end of the movie where Batman is escaping from the police and Jim Gordon is talking to his son.', u""The masks that the Joker and his partners wear at the beginning of the movie during the bank robbery are the exact same as the masks that Joker and his henchmen use in his first appearance on the 60's series."", u'At 6\'1"", Heath Ledger is the second tallest Joker, after Cesar Romero\'s 6\'3"", and before Jack Nicholson\'s 5\'9"".', u'At the fund raising party, Bruce remarks about Harvey\'s previous campaign slogan ""I believe in Harvey Dent"". He then says, ""Look at that face"", which turns out to be ironic since Harvey later becomes a gruesome Two-Face villain that is hard to look at.']","[u'Argentina::14 July 2008 (Buenos Aires)\n (premiere)', u'USA::14 July 2008 (New York City, New York)\n (premiere)', u'Australia::16 July 2008', u'Taiwan::16 July 2008', u'Argentina::17 July 2008', u'Bolivia::17 July 2008', u'Chile::17 July 2008', u'Greece::17 July 2008', u'Hong Kong::17 July 2008', u'Malaysia::17 July 2008', u'Peru::17 July 2008', u'Philippines::17 July 2008', u'Singapore::17 July 2008', u'Thailand::17 July 2008', u'Uruguay::17 July 2008', u'Brazil::18 July 2008', u'Canada::18 July 2008', u'Colombia::18 July 2008', u'Indonesia::18 July 2008', u'India::18 July 2008', u'Mexico::18 July 2008', u'Panama::18 July 2008', u'USA::18 July 2008', u'Venezuela::18 July 2008', u'UK::21 July 2008 (London)\n (premiere)', u'Iceland::21 July 2008\n (premiere)', u'Denmark::22 July 2008', u'Belgium::23 July 2008', u'Egypt::23 July 2008', u'Iceland::23 July 2008', u'Italy::23 July 2008', u'United Arab Emirates::24 July 2008', u'Ecuador::24 July 2008', u'Finland::24 July 2008 (limited)', u'UK::24 July 2008', u'Croatia::24 July 2008', u'Ireland::24 July 2008', u'Israel::24 July 2008', u'Kuwait::24 July 2008', u'Lebanon::24 July 2008', u'Lithuania::24 July 2008', u'Netherlands::24 July 2008', u'New Zealand::24 July 2008', u'Portugal::24 July 2008', u'Serbia::24 July 2008', u'Slovenia::24 July 2008', u'Slovakia::24 July 2008', u'Bulgaria::25 July 2008', u'Estonia::25 July 2008', u'Finland::25 July 2008', u'Latvia::25 July 2008', u'Nigeria::25 July 2008', u'Norway::25 July 2008', u'Romania::25 July 2008', u'Sweden::25 July 2008', u'Turkey::25 July 2008', u'South Africa::25 July 2008', u'Germany::1 August 2008 (limited)', u'Japan::2 August 2008 (limited)', u'Poland::2 August 2008 (limited)', u'South Korea::6 August 2008', u'Czech Republic::7 August 2008', u'Hungary::7 August 2008', u'Poland::8 August 2008', u'Japan::9 August 2008', u'Switzerland::13 August 2008 (French speaking region)', u'Spain::13 August 2008', u'France::13 August 2008', u'Kazakhstan::14 August 2008', u'Russia::14 August 2008', u'Ukraine::14 August 2008', u'Austria::21 August 2008', u'Switzerland::21 August 2008 (German speaking region)', u'Germany::21 August 2008', u'Armenia::28 August 2008', u'Pakistan::10 October 2008 (Rawalpindi)', u'USA::23 January 2009 (IMAX version) (re-release)', u'Japan::24 January 2009 (re-release)', u'Brazil::6 February 2009 (IMAX version) (re-release)', u'Singapore::12 February 2009 (re-release)', u'Mexico::13 February 2009 (re-release)', u'South Korea::19 February 2009 (re-release)', u'Peru::19 February 2009 (re-release)', u'Hong Kong::24 September 2009 (re-release) (IMAX version)', u'Spain::31 January 2015 (Barcelona) (re-release)']",1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

However, the identity of Ra's Al Ghul seems to bounce back and forth between Liam Neeson and Ken Watanabe whenever Ducard addresses Bruce Wayne in the film. To make a clear distinction, according to the comic background, Henri Ducard is referred to as Ra's Al Ghul's personal spokesperson, and is very much a normal human being.

Director Christopher Nolan felt that Joe Pantoliano (Teddy) did not quite nail the end of the line, so he decided to re-record the last two words to his liking, delivering them himself. Therefore, in the final film, the words, ""you freak"", as we hear them, are actually being said not by Pantoliano, but by Nolan impersonating Pantoliano\'s voice.

A few years earlier, he was given an experimental pain killer that induced amnesia for a surgery he had undergone.

She played the role of Trinity and he played Cypher.', u'Carrie-Anne Moss personally recommended Joe Pantoliano for the role of Teddy, having become good friends with him while they were working on ""The Matrix"". Christopher Nolan and his producers had reservations about this because they weren\'t sure Pantoliano\'s screen persona (often overtly villainous) was the right match for Teddy, but they met with him and decided his talent made him the right person for the part. Nolan later praised Pantoliano for having brought the right amount of subtlety to his performance as Teddy.', u'Droste Effect on the main poster of the movie is a reference to Doodlebug (1997), another movie by Christopher Nolan.', u'Denis Leary turned down the role of Teddy.', u""The film's subject matter was conceived of when Christopher Nolan was joined by his brother Jonathan on a late summer cross-country road trip, as Christopher was moving to Los Angeles and Jonathan had time before returning to his studies at Georgetown to spend time with his brother and help with with the move.

That process led to Nolan nearly casting Aaron Eckhart in the role, and eventually giving the part to Guy Pearce.', u'When we first see Leonard\'s map of the area, we can see two streets that have commonality with Blue Velvet (1986).

This supports the conclusion, that the tragic end of Sammy's story, is actually an event from Leonard's own past, just as Teddy (Joe Pantoliano) later tries to convince him."", u'The picture of Leonard that he finds in the envelope under his motel door, shows him pointing at a bare spot on his chest. He tells Natalie that this spot is reserved for when he finds John G. Later, when Leonard is driving to the tattoo parlor, he thinks about his wife, and a flashback is shown in which he is lying in bed with his wife. The bare spot in this shot now contains, ""I\'ve done it.""', u""While Leonard is watching television at Natalie's, a picture of a needle with a person wearing a white v-neck shirt in the background can be seen. In the story of Sammy Jankis, Sammy injects his wife with insulin while he watches television. This alludes to the possibility that Sammy Jankis' story is really Leonard's own. Moreover, the white v-neck in the background, is the same shirt that Leonard's wife wears in another scene."", u""During Leonard's third and final conversation with the anonymous caller, his fingers hover over the numbers 555-0134.

The scenes appear in the film like this: 1, V, 2, U, 3, T, 4, S, 5, R, 6, Q...20, C, 21, B, 22/A[1] The two types of scenes alternate. The black and white scenes (numbers) start from the beginning, and work forward to the climax at 22/A, while the color scenes (letters) work backward from the climax at 22/A. The climax scene (22/A) changes to color halfway through, showing the convergence of the two story lines.', u'Before filming the scene where Leonard kills Jimmy, Larry Holden told Guy Pearce to really attack him.

When asked about the film, they felt that it accurately captured the event but that the soundtrack was louder than the actual bombardment, a comment that greatly amused director Christopher Nolan.', u'After first-hand accounts of the Dunkirk evacuation revealed to Christopher Nolan how young and inexperienced the soldiers were, he decided to cast young and unknown actors for the beach setting.', u'Christopher Nolan, along with his wife Emma Thomas and a friend, made the crossing from England to Dunkirk on a boat, the way the civilians would have done during the Dunkirk Evacuation. Nolan said it took nineteen hours because of the conditions of the sea.', u'Director Christopher Nolan actually rode in the Spitfire shown in the movie in order to get a sense of the aerial feel of the fighter plane; with the purpose being to help him shoot and provide an authentically realistic experience of the dogfights for the audience.', u'In regards to the Battle of Dunkirk\'s importance, director Christopher Nolan stated, ""This is an essential moment in the history of the Second World War. If this evacuation had not been a success, Great Britain would have been obliged to capitulate. And the whole world would have been lost, or would have known a different fate: the Germans would undoubtedly have conquered Europe, the U.S. would not have returned to war. It is a true point of rupture in war and in history of the world. A decisive moment. And the success of the evacuation allowed Churchill to impose the idea of a moral victory, which allowed him to galvanize his troops like civilians and to impose a spirit of resistance while the logic of this sequence should have been that of surrender.

From all accounts he gave extraordinary service, working around the clock under the most demanding circumstances to evacuate as many soldiers as possible. He stayed until no more could be evacuated but was killed in the English Channel on his way back to England when the vessel he was on was attacked by enemy aircraft.

These dogfights occurred more inland from Dunkirk, hence why the soldiers on the beaches didn't see many fighters during the evacuation, and why they thought the RAF had abandoned them."", u'According to director Christopher Nolan, the tension that he feels watching Saving Private Ryan (1998) was not the tension he wanted for Dunkirk (2017).', u'It is the first Christopher Nolan movie to be based on historical events.

Speaking about the narrative structure in Premiere magazine, Christopher Nolan stated: ""For the soldiers who embarked in the conflict, the events took place on different temporalities. On land, some stayed one week stuck on the beach. On the water, the events lasted a maximum day; and if you were flying to Dunkirk, the British spitfires would carry an hour of fuel.

Unlike Deere, Farrier is captured in the closing shots. Deere famously got back to England after punching a naval officer in the face when he refused to let the RAF on board.

Christopher Nolan accepted these terms, as long as they did not get in the way of the making of the movie. That did not prevent clashes, though; at one point Thorne spent two weeks talking Nolan out of an idea about travelling faster than light.', u'For a cornfield scene, Christopher Nolan sought to grow five hundred acres of corn, which he learned was feasible from his producing of Man of Steel (2013).

Matthew McConaughey stars in both films.', u'The wormhole explanation using paper and pen is exactly the same as it appears in Event Horizon (1997).', u'Like Inception (2010) and the last two ""Dark Knight"" films, Christopher Nolan has focused on as many real environments as possible. ""We have spatial interiors. We built closed sets and shot it like a documentary, like the actors were really there,"" he said. Nolan had the film\'s visual effects created in advance, and projected onto screens placed outside the spacecraft set, so when the actors looked out the windows of their vessel they would be able to see and react to a real environment, and not a green screen. Technically, Nolan said he shot with an IMAX camera on this film more than on any of his previous pictures. He also wanted to give greater enhancement to the audio experience this time around. He stated that he has ""very ambitious sound mix plans. I want to give audiences an incredible immersive experience.

He remarked that in McConaughey he ""needed an everyday man who can experience these extraordinary events.""', u'Dr. Kip Thorne won a scientific bet against Stephen Hawking upon the astrophysics theory that underlies Interstellar (2014).

I think Matthew\'s success of late is the rest of us catching up to what he\'s been doing . . . "" Jennifer Garner talked about two different films she\'d done with him and explained that he\'d given the same gravity and intensity to both different genres, ""and I can tell you as a director, there\'s no question that this is a performer who can\'t say, \'Pass the salt\' without it being truthful, without meaning something . . . I\'ve never worked with an actor so relentless in his pursuit of truth in everything he does."" Nolan also recalled that while he was presenting the night\'s award to McConnaughey, he remembered how the super-dad would play with Nolan\'s own kids while on set: ""I find him extremely serious. But my kids found him very amusing on his days off when he would build forts with them and his kids, thereby making me look like a slightly worse father.""', u""The film parodies the story that the moon landings were faked by the government. It's used in the movie as an attempt to quell future generations' enthusiasm for space travel. Amazingly, real-life conspiracy theorists claim that Stanley Kubrick directed the television footage of the landings, using leftover props from 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), which itself is one of the inspirations for this film."", u'A copy of Stephen King\'s novel ""The Stand"" is visible among Murph\'s books. King\'s book is about the near extinction of humanity and the survivors\' struggle to relocate and settle down.', u'Starting in 2014, Paramount Pictures began to cease releasing its features on traditional film stock in favor of digital projection formats. However, as Christopher Nolan is a strong proponent for the continued use of film prints over digital, he insisted that this film be additionally released in the 15/70mm IMAX, standard 70mm and 35mm film formats a full two days before its wider digital release.', u'The wormhole shown in this film near Saturn is exactly the same place shown in Man of Steel (2013), produced by Christopher Nolan.

The other five titles are Batman Begins (2005), The Prestige (2006), The Dark Knight (2008), Inception (2010), and The Dark Knight Rises (2012).', u'Christopher Nolan described the film as ""an ode to human spaceflight"" and cited multiple films as influences on the project: Metropolis (1927), 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977), Alien (1979), and Blade Runner (1982) served as influences for the film\'s depiction of science and space travel, while The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948) and The Mirror (1975) influenced the human drama. Nolan also cited the Steven Spielberg films, Jaws (1975) and Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977), as films that manage to tackle serious subject matters, while still appealing to all audiences as examples for him to emulate. Nolan and his crew studied the IMAX documentaries of NASA by Toni Myers, for visual reference of space-faring missions, and sought to mimic the look of her use of IMAX cameras aboard spaceships. Finally, Nolan screened a print of The Right Stuff (1983) for the crew before shooting started, to help them understand their roles in the film.', u'The dismantled robot on the ice planet has the designation KIPP, which is a reference to Executive Producer Dr. Kip Thorne.', u'Given that the film is 169 minutes long, and cost approximately 165 million dollars to make, that works out to about 976,331 dollars per minute.', u'Filmed under the fake name ""Flora\'s Letter,"" after Christopher Nolan\'s daughter Flora Nolan.', u'In a Q&A interview at CinemaCon in Las Vegas on March 26, 2014, Christopher Nolan stated that this film is ""very different"" from his past work and he was inspired by the movies he saw growing up during what he termed ""the golden age of the blockbuster"" - essentially, four quadrant films that didn\'t need a ""family"" label to appeal to all audiences. Nolan noted it\'s ""really about going back to those sort of films.""', u'To get inspiration for real-world space travel, Christopher Nolan invited former astronaut Marsha Ivins to the set.', u'Some of the ""archive footage"" interviews were filmed specifically for the production, and then altered by the visual effects teams to appear much older.', u'The ""hyper-sleep"" chambers place the astronauts\' bodies in a cold liquid, as seen after they wake up, when they are covered in blankets or thermal blankets. This is likely a practical reference to studies that have shown a state of hibernation can be achieved in the human body by causing hypothermia. This technology has been used to treat brain damage, and has been proposed as a viable means of keeping people with severe injuries alive after accidents, while they are transported to medical facilities, where they can be treated by specialists.', u""This is Christopher Nolan's seventh film to be included in the IMDb Top 250."", u'The character of Murph was originally a boy in early drafts of the script.', u'The name of the black hole is ""Gargantua,"" who was also a giant with an incredible appetite, very difficult to satisfy.

Coincidentally, McConaughey graduated from Longview High School in Longview, Texas.', u""This was Christopher Nolan's first film since Memento (2000) to not be filmed by Cinematographer Wally Pfister, who was busy with his directorial debut Transcendence (2014). Nolan hired Cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema to replace Pfister."", u'The film has six Oscar winners in the cast: Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Sir Michael Caine, Ellen Burstyn, Casey Affleck, and Matt Damon. It also includes two Oscar nominees: Jessica Chastain and John Lithgow.', u""The film began as a Paramount Pictures production. When Christopher Nolan took the director's chair, Warner Brothers, which had released Nolan's recent productions, sought a stake in the project. In exchange for international distribution rights, Warner Brothers gave Paramount Pictures the rights to co-finance future sequels of Friday the 13th (2009) and South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut (1999)."", u'With a running time of 2 hours, 47 minutes, and 7 seconds, it is the longest IMAX movie ever released as of 2014.', u'In the office of NASA\'s secret base, you can catch a glimpse of the lithographs of ""From the Earth to the Moon"" by Jules Verne.', u'Besides Saturn\'s connection to crops, he was also known as Kronos, the god of time (""chronos"") and cycles (thus the eponymous chronology, chronicle, et cetera.). Since time is a key theme in the movie, the appearance of the wormhole next to the planet Saturn is highly significant.', u'The ""Miller Planet"" scene was filmed in Iceland.', u'The documentary-style interviews of older survivors, shown at the beginning of the film, and again on the television playing in the farmhouse, towards the end of the movie, are from Ken Burns The Dust Bowl (2012).

The entire game is scientifically correct in respect to time dilation, gravity, and energy.', u'The visual effects that portray the wormhole with stars stretching out on its horizon is known in astrophysics as ""Gravitational Lensing,"" That is, in fact, how astronomers have identified black holes (an intense gravitational field bending space so much, that light coming from stars behind it is stretched out around the sphere of the black hole\'s ""event horizon""). Considering the high-degree of scientific accuracy of this film, it\'s not inconceivable that a wormhole would look much in real-life, as it is portrayed on this movie.', u'The TARS robot, when standing upright, strongly resembled a much smaller version of the monolith in 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968).', u""Christopher Nolan's fourth straight film to be named one of AFI's Top Ten Movies of the Year."", u'The building designs are inspired by the works of modernist architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe.', u'The books displayed on the book shelves shown in this film, were the actual books Nolan had read, and used, for his research about black holes and singularity.', u'The 70mm IMAX version is two minutes shorter than the regular 70mm, Digital IMAX, 35mm, and digital projection versions. This is because the end credits are played in an abbreviated slide-show form (rather than scrolling from bottom to top), due to the size capacity of the IMAX platters, which can hold a maximum of 167 minutes of film.', u""A.

In this film, Matthew McConaughey plays an engineer who receives map coordinates from a mysterious source and follows them to a top-secret government operation. Also in both films, stumbling upon this operation leads directly to him being invited to take part in a space flight. Both films also feature a scene of the main character in his truck fumbling with maps.

The first Zimmer score was Inception (2010) against The Social Network (2010)."", u'Nathan Crowley described the Lander spacecraft as a ""heavy Russian helicopter.""', u'Christopher Nolan earned a whopping twenty million dollars, and twenty percent of the gross, for this film.', u'Hans Zimmer\'s score for Interstellar bears a striking resemblance to his previous iconic theme ""Journey to the Line"" from The Thin Red Line (1998). That theme was born out of trial and error. Terrence Malick had been dissatisfied with Zimmer\'s score, and had Zimmer continuously reworking melodies, to come up with various approaches to the music. Thus ""Journey to the Line"" was finally born. Many of his latter scores (especially Interstellar) would go on to bear an uncanny resemblance, or seem to work as variations building on that theme.', u'One of the books seen on the bookcase in Murph\'s room is Stephen King\'s ""The Stand."" Matthew McConaughey has been cast in The Stand, Josh Boone\'s long-mooted adaption of the very same book.', u'Although released in 2014, this was the most pirated movie of 2015.

While not explicitly referenced, the Dark Knight trilogy directed by Christopher Nolan features a character, known as Ra\'s Al Ghul, who, in the Batman comics cheated death numerous times, thanks to the magic and science of the ""Lazarus Pit."" The trilogy, and this film, share common themes, such as rebirth and beginning new lives, and they also involve end-of-the-world types of scenarios (although in the Batman films, it would be on a smaller scale in the beginning, at least).', u'Matthew McConaughey appears in this film opposite Matt Damon and Jessica Chastain, both of whom would appear together the next year in The Martian (2015). He previously appeared in Contact (1997), opposite Tom Skerritt and John Hurt, who had previously appeared together in Alien (1979). Both of those films were set in space, and directed by Ridley Scott.', u'Brand\'s line to Cooper: ""try to breathe as little as possible,"" is also in Christopher Nolan film The Prestige (2006), said by John Cutter to Olivia Wenscombe.', u'If 7 years equals 1 hour on the water planet, a day expires every 1.5 seconds.', u'The landing on the water planet is filmed in a way that is reminiscent of the crash landing into a lake, at the beginning of Planet of the Apes (1968).', u'Christopher Nolan chose to give the role for Matthew McConaughey after seeing his performance in Mud (2012).', u""Edgar Rice Burroughs' John Carter of Mars makes a friend and ally named Tars Tarkas from whom TARS could be named."", u'When Cooper is being shown the launching bay and ship for the first time, he passes a pillar on the left side of the screen with the words ""LEVEL"" written on it. While the pillar is coming into frame, the ""L""\'s are cut off, and all that is visible is the word ""EVE."" As the scene cuts to Professor Brand, you can see the same thing on a different pillar on the left. This word continues to be obvious throughout the entire scene. This appears to be a nod to the popular video game, EVE Online (2003), which has a back story in which a gateway mysteriously appeared in the solar system, and how mankind migrated through the wormhole into an uncharted region of space.', u'Ellen Burstyn played an old and crotchety woman in the movie version of Margaret Laurence\'s novel Kivienkeli (2007).

Franklin and his team at Double Negative. Thorne provided pages of deeply sourced theoretical equations to the team, which then created new CGI software programs based on these equations to create accurate computer simulations of these phenomena. Some individual frames took up to one hundred hours to render, and ultimately the whole CGI program reached to eight hundred terabytes of data. The resulting visual effects provided Thorne with new insight into the effects of gravitational lensing and accretion disks surrounding black holes, and led to him writing two scientific papers--one for the astrophysics community, and one for the computer graphics community.', u""The Wormhole is placed near Saturn as a reference to 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), because Stanley Kubrick originally planned for part of that movie to take place at Saturn. Unfortunately, as visual effects technology wasn't able to make Saturn's rings at that time, he changed it to Jupiter."", u'There is a reference to a ""tesseract."" The first known reference to the term in science fiction literature occurred in Robert A. Heinlein\'s 1941 short story ""And He Built a Crooked House."" In the story, an architect designs a house based upon the geometric concept of a four-dimensional analogue of the cube. He does this so well, that the house folds in upon itself and creates a dimensional loop within the structure. People within the house can see themselves by looking through one room into another which is, in fact, the room they are in and find it nearly impossible to leave, as they are in a loop, much like what Coop saw when he entered the black hole.', u""Although Doyle is presumed drowned after being struck by the tidal wave on Miller's planet, his suit appears intact when the Ranger leaves, meaning it is remotely possible he could have survived the impact, and is merely unconscious. Given the extreme time dilation on Miller's planet, a rescue is very possible. Assuming a mission were to be dispatched from Cooper Station orbiting Saturn, it would take only nine hours in relative time for Doyle to be rescued, but 65+ years would have passed for the rest of the world (assuming a dilation factor of one hour per seven years)."", u'The very first line in the movie, spoken by Coop\'s daughter Murph is as follows: ""I thought you were the ghost."" She means that she heard him moving around and thought her ""ghost"" was making noise. This line carries more significance when the ending is known; Cooper truly was Murph\'s ghost the whole time.', u'While leaving home, Cooper says to Murph that ""once you\'re a parent, you\'re the ghost of your children\'s future."" In the end, it is revealed that Cooper was Murph\'s ghost all along.', u'Old Murph (Ellen Burstyn) has the first and last lines of dialogue.', u""Cooper and Dr. Brand came back to Endurance after 23 years, four months and eight days. This means that their entire mission on Miller's planet took some three hours 17 minutes (based on the plot's assertion that one hour on the planet equals seven years on Earth/Endurance)"", u""After the crew landed on Miller's planet, just when they are about to get off Ranger 1, the score softens, and we can hear ticks approximately once every second. Because of the time dilation due to Gargantua's gravity, every tick represents approximately seventeen hours on earth."", u""Matthew McConaughey's children Levi McConnaughey and Vida McConnaughey appear in one of the final scenes, at Ellen Burstyn's bedside. Ellen caresses Levi's head."", u""Hans Zimmer's soundtrack was so powerful, that many people stated that they cried during the docking sequence (when Endurance is spinning and the crew needs to dock their Ranger to it). In the initial release of the soundtrack, the full music of that sequence was not included. A few weeks after the release of the soundtrack, Zimmer added the music to the soundtrack, as a bonus track on the iTunes Deluxe Edition."", u'The characters mention traveling via a ""tesseract,"" which is a multi-dimensional geometric structure also known as a ""hypercube."" Coined by Charles Howard Hinton in 1888 in his book ""A New Era of Thought,"" the tesseract is a structure that extends a normal cube into four dimensions. It was popularized in Robert A. Heinlein\'s short story ""--And He Built a Crooked House"" from 1941, and later in the 1962 science fiction novel ""A Wrinkle In Time"" by Madeleine L\'Engle.', u""Many of the characters' names are found on the books in Murph's room as authors."", u""The escape method from the black hole, using the space ships jointly as thrusting power (and then leaving only one thrusting ship behind for Hathaway's character), resembles the escape method in the movie 2010 (1984) (from one of Jupiter's changing moons)."", u""The original script of the Steven Spielberg version of this film depicts an almost entirely different movie. Some examples include Murph being a boy, no humans are first sent into space (probes are) and a probe leads Cooper to the hidden NASA base, which is on a remote island in California where Brand and Cooper deep-sea dive for parts. Also, the robots are much more human-like, featuring hands and shoulders. TARS is sucked into space early on when the ship gets stuck between two black holes (Gargantua and Pantagruel--two French mythical giants) immediately after entering the wormhole. Afterwards the crew, including an additional member named Roth, only visit the ice planet, where they discover that a Chinese mission had been there some thirty years prior, and seemed to have vanished, until it is learned that they were killed by the radiation of a neutron star. The crew falls through the ice into an entirely different ecosystem with a living rearranging forest and colonial organisms that fight each other every night, compounding into larger organisms to reach a higher spot closer to the ice sky for sunlight in the day. After searching the area, they find an abandoned Chinese camp with an experimental black box that can control gravity nearly at will, and are then discovered by Chinese robots who sabotage their return home with the box. The crew orbits a black hole (lasting hundreds of Earth years) before entering a second wormhole where they interact directly with the fifth dimension bulk beings who lead them to a four thousand-year-old space station built by the Chinese that's only a few hundred years old, due to space-time relativity, powered by a captured mini black hole that views galaxies as flat, lines of light. The Chinese have built thousands of worm holes, and tried to travel back in time with the gravity technology to save all of Earth, but died in the process. Cooper returns to Earth, in the year 2230, to find a barren land with ice storms. He sits down prepared to die in the storm, then awakens in a manner similar to the movie, where he meets his great-great-grandson, rather than an aged Murph. After being bored with the current world, Cooper steals a ship to find Brand (the two had been intimate before Brand parted Cooper, to continue to explore space rather than return to Earth)."", u'When the TARS robot and Romily are repairing the KIPP robot on Dr. Mann\'s planet, TARS warns, ""get back, professor, get back!"" Right before KIPP detonates, you can faintly hear it say, ""please don\'t make me . . . "" Light is shed on what this means, in Christopher Nolan\'s since-released comic ""Absolute Zero,"" an account of Dr. Mann\'s and KIPP\'s survey of the planet.', u'One of the books visible on Murph\'s shelf is David Wroblewski\'s ""The Story of Edgar Sawtelle"". This book hints at key plot points, where the title character, who also lives on a farm, is aided in solving a mystery through the help of his deceased father\'s ghost.', u""The first Christopher Nolan film where Sir Michael Caine's character dies."", u'When Cooper exits the wormhole back to Earth\'s solar system, the scene resembles the ""star child"" scene from Stanley Kubrick\'s 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), which is referenced several times in this film.', u'The tesseract scene (which looks like a giant library, and allows Cooper to access his daughter\'s bookshelf in the past) bears some resemblance to the concept of L-space as described in Terry Pratchett\'s ""Discworld"" books. L-space (short for Library space) is the principle that the mass of information contained in a large collection of books warps space and time, and in consequence a sufficiently large library allows the visitor to access any library anywhere in space and time.', u""Cooper and Donald sit on their porch before Cooper's departure drinking what appears to be beer, despite the fact that all crops except for corn (including ostensibly hops and barley, ingredients in beer) are not able to be grown."", u""In spite of TARS' humorous line about never leaving Dr. Brand behind, that's exactly what happens near the end when he is jettisoned into the black hole, Gargantua."", u'When inside the tesseract, during the black hole sequence, one of the books on the bookshelf is James Ellroy\'s ""The Big Nowhere"" - clearly an allusion to where Cooper is at that moment.', u'The scene near the end, when Cooper travels out of the tesseract, back through the wormhole, and touches Brand\'s hand resembles Michelangelo\'s ""Creation of Adam"" painting in the Sistine Chapel.', u'In the scene where Cooper has to land their ship on Miller\'s water planet, the camera focuses on him gripping the seat of his chair. This is a reference to a common aviation saying, ""Fly by the seat of your pants."" Before modern instruments, pilots relied on instinct and their senses to fly, such as sight, using landmarks to gauge altitude or distance. Pilots also used feeling from the vibrations in their seat from air hitting the plane to determine windspeed and direction. Cooper verifies this when he said he needs to ""feel the air"" in order to land properly instead of relying on technology.', u""On-screen body count: Four. Several characters also die off-screen by the end of the film: Donald, Romily, Jesse (Tom's firstborn son, possibly from dust-related respiratory problems), and most likely Tom, as he is never mentioned, nor seen during Cooper's time on the space station, at the end of the film."", u'Toward the end of the movie, when Cooper is walking toward the copy of his house on the space station, a series of screens on his path depict people narrating their past experiences on Earth. On the very last screen, for an instance, you can see someone who looks vaguely like Arthur C. Clarke, the writer of 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968). This is not actually Clarke, and is in fact one of the people featured from the The Dust Bowl (2012) footage, possibly selected because of the resemblance.', u'The spaceship near the end of the film resembles the spaceship in the Arthur C. Clarke novel ""Rendezvous with Rama"", a fifty kilometer (thirty-one mile) cylindrical alien spaceship, that can also carry a human colony to the stars.', u'Dr. Mann emphasizes to Cooper, that before he dies, he will see his children, foreshadowing his actual reunion with Murph.', u'The first of two movies in which Matt Damon has played a stranded astronaut stuck on another planet, the other being The Martian (2015).', u""In Timestalkers (1987), an historian researches clues of time travel in the past (from a remote, plausible future) which leads him to a top-secret military base and hangar. The plot device is similar (although it's a former pilot and, later, his astrophysicist daughter) to this film. William Devane acted in both films."", u'While Coop takes down time at (the orbital replica of) his homestead, the surroundings are curved upwards in M\xf6bius-like angles. Elysium (2013) - which also starred Matt Damon - had a similar, human settlement apart from Earth.', u""Casey Affleck and Matt Damon previously co-starred in the films Chasing Amy (1997), Good Will Hunting (1997), Gerry (2002), as well as the Ocean's trilogy."", u""The film's main villain, Dr. Mann, played by Matt Damon, is the only villain created by Nolan who is not part of the film's main conflict."", u'When Cooper wakes Dr. Mann, he says, ""You literally raised me from dead,"" to which Cooper replies, ""Lazarus."" The ""Lazarus Pit"" was a major location in The Dark Knight Rises (2012), a film directed by Christopher Nolan.', u'When Cooper tries docking onto the spinning Endurance, CASE tell him ""this is no time for caution."" Consequently, the score Hans Zimmer titled for this scene is called ""No Time for Caution.""', u'When Dr. Mann fails to dock perfectly, and the Endurance explodes, the pod that exploded may have significance. When looking at images of Endurance, it traditionally has the ""arm"" in the 3:00 position of the clock face the ship represents. The exploded pod therefore is at 10:00. This is interesting, as this is the tenth film Christopher Nolan has directed. This may have been intentional, or an odd coincidence.', u""Ellen Burstyn played the older version of Murph, who was the daughter of Matthew McConaughey's character Cooper. In 2000, Burstyn played Sara Goldfarb, who was the mother of Jared Leto's character Harry Goldfarb.

He ultimately decided it was disrespectful to Heath Ledger."", u'While doing promotional interviews for the film, Tom Hardy stated that the most difficult parts of the movie to shoot were the fight scenes. Not because of the physicality of them, but because he was such a huge Batman fan growing up, that he said ""it felt like I was beating up my childhood hero"". However, he also said that despite his worship of the character, the moment Christopher Nolan yelled ""Action""!, Hardy just started throwing punches as hard as he could.', u'When Bruce Wayne traces the fake fingerprints that the Catwoman was wearing when she cracked his safe, the result shows a ""Nikolai Ondrejko"". This is the same name that was used by the Joker to author the fake obituary for the Mayor in The Dark Knight (2008).', u'According to Gary Oldman, Christopher Nolan told the actors the ending of the film verbally to avoid any leaks.', u'According to producers, the line ""That\'s a lovely, lovely voice"" was improvised by Tom Hardy.', u'Tom Hardy, standing at 5\'9"", had to wear three-inch lifts to make his character Bane appear as tall, or taller than co-stars Christian Bale, Morgan Freeman, and Sir Michael Caine.', u'Tom Hardy accepted the role of Bane without reading the script. He was verbally told that he would have unprecedented access to extensive stunt training and equipment that he could enjoy knocking around.', u'When Selina Kyle disappears from a rooftop, Batman\'s remark ""So that\'s what that feels like"" is lifted directly from the DC graphic novel ""Kingdom Come"". Even the circumstance is similar, except it was with Superman.', u'Anne Hathaway has said that she desperately coveted the role of Catwoman, and was a complete nervous wreck after her audition. The first time her agent phoned after her screen test, he said he had good news and asked if Hathaway was sitting down. Hathaway immediately screamed ""I\'m Catwoman!"" and ran around the room in a frenzy. Unfortunately, her agent had to calm the actress down--he had called to let her know that she\'d been invited to host the Academy Awards. Hathaway has said she was so shocked she went numb at the offer. Fortunately, shortly thereafter, her agent phoned again to let her know that she had been offered the part of Catwoman as well.', u'According to Christopher Nolan, Bane was chosen as the film\'s main antagonist ""to test Batman mentally as well as physically.""', u'Christopher Nolan wanted Marion Cotillard so much for the role of Miranda Tate, that he modified the filming schedule to accommodate her pregnancy. When Nolan invited Cotillard for the film in 2010, she told him that she was pregnant, and didn\'t know if she would be able to do it, but Nolan decided to keep her in the film. Cotillard started filming just one month after giving birth, and Nolan also made room on-set for her family. In the last months of filming, Cotillard also shot another film at the same time in France, Rust and Bone (2012). She was flying back and forth between the U.S. and France to shoot both movies. During an interview for Vogue in August 2012, Nolan marveled at Cotillard\'s ability to do her job so soon after giving birth, calling it ""amazing to see"" and describing her as ""Superwoman"".', u'To prepare for his role as Bane, Tom Hardy gained thirty pounds in weight, and studied various fighting styles to use in the film.', u'Bane\'s theme is a chant which features the term ""deshi basara"", which is Moroccan for the word ""rise"".', u'Tom Hardy has several large tattoos on his chest and arms that had to be covered using heavy cake makeup for the film.', u'Christian Bale is the first actor to portray Batman/Bruce Wayne in three Batman films.', u'Out of respect for Heath Ledger, the Joker is never once mentioned for the whole film.', u'When Jonathan Crane first appears as the ""sentencing judge,"" he is wearing a heavily tattered coat that looks like it has straw coming out of the shoulders. This is a clear nod to his alter ego, Scarecrow.', u""During the motorcycle chase scene, Bane is wearing a red helmet with black visor as well as a brown motorcycle jacket.

She called it her most physically demanding role to date.', u""At one point it was rumored that the Penguin was to have been featured as one of the film's major villains, and would have been played by Philip Seymour Hoffman.

This was done by the sound effects team to further contrast Bane\'s ""brute"" style from Batman\'s ""stealth"" method of combat.', u'When Officer Blake talks about ""giant alligators"" being in the sewer line, this may be an intentional nod towards Batman villain Killer Croc, whom Bane out-wrestled to become head of Gotham\'s gangland.', u'According to Costume Designer Lindy Hemming, she took two years to design Bane\'s coat; it was inspired by a Swedish army jacket, and a French Revolution frock coat, to make Bane look equally dictatorial and revolutionary, ""like an amalgam of all sorts of bits and pieces he cobbled together as he passed through some very remote places.""', u'Tom Hardy described Bane as an absolute terrorist: ""He\'s brutal, but also incredibly clinical, in the fact that he has a result-based and oriented fighting style. The style is heavy-handed, heavy-footed... it\'s nasty. It\'s not about fighting, it\'s about carnage!""', u""The Batsuit consisted of 110 separate pieces. The base layer was made of a polyester mesh, utilized by the military and high-tech sports manufacturers due to its breathability and moisture-retaining properties; molded pieces of flexible urethane were then attached to the mesh to form the overall body armor plating. Carbon fiberpanels were placed inside the sections on the legs, chest and abdomen. The cowl was sculpted from a cast of Christian Bale's face and head to become a perfect fit for Bale."", u'In designing the Batwing, Production Designer Nathan Crowley approached it as if it were an actual military project, emphasizing the need for it to ""fit into the same family as the Tumbler and the Batpod"": he incorporated designs from military aircraft, including the Harrier Jump Jet, Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey and the Boeing AH-64 Apache.', u'Cillian Murphy holds the record for the most frequently appearing Batman villain, he has played the evil Dr. Jonathan Crane a.k.a.

This is in keeping with the original incarnation of the character (not yet named Selina Kyle) who was a jewel thief, and was known only as ""The Cat"" before becoming ""The Catwoman."" However, various official merchandise and marketing material refer to Selina Kyle as Catwoman when she is wearing her masked costume. Furthermore, the shooting script refers to Kyle as ""Catwoman"" when in costume.', u'According to Tom Hardy, he based his voice for Bane on Bartley Gorman (1944 - 2002), an Irish Traveller who was the undefeated Bare-knuckle boxing champion of the United Kingdom: ""The choice of the accent is actually a man called Bartley Gorman, who was a bare knuckle fighter, a Romani gypsy. So I wanted to underpin the Latin, but a Romani Latin opposed to Latino.""', u'The first draft of the script ran approximately 400 pages.', u'Christian Bale surprised locals by casually dropping in to enjoy some British craft ale at the Admiral Rodney pub in Wollaton, Nottingham, while filming the exteriors to Wayne Manor at Wollaton Hall.', u""Selina Kyle's catsuit was made from two layers of polyurethane-coated spandex."", u""Anne Hathaway, Natalie Portman, Keira Knightley, Kate Mara, Gemma Arterton, Jessica Biel, Blake Lively, and Charlotte Riley (Tom Hardy's fiancee at the time), all auditioned for the role of Selina Kyle/Catwoman. After the initial audition process Hathaway, Biel, and Mara all screen tested. Ultimately, Hathaway won the role."", u'Tom Hardy is the second actor to play Bane in the Batman film franchises. The role was previously played by Jeep Swenson in Batman & Robin (1997).', u'The actual plane used in the movie by the CIA operative to transport Dr. Pavel later crashed almost a year later after the film was released. The aircraft, a Embraer EMB-110 Bandeirante registered ZS-NVB, crashed on June 29th, 2013 in Botswana. Both the pilot and co-pilot died in the crash.', u'On July 20, 2012 during a midnight screening for the film in Aurora, Colorado, a man entered the theater and opened fire. James Holmes ended up killing twelve people and injured fifty-eight. He was arrested outside the theater a few minutes after the shooting, and was charged with 24 counts of murder and 116 counts of attempted murder. Holmes was sentenced in August 2015 to life in prison without parole for the crime. After the incident, several cast and crew members, including Christopher Nolan, Christian Bale, Anne Hathaway, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and Gary Oldman released statements expressing their sorrow over the attack. Their publicity appearances, including a lavish premiere in France, were canceled. Warner Brothers decided not to release opening weekend grosses until the following Monday, out of consideration for the victims. Christian Bale went and visited the surviving victims at the hospital several days later.', u'During the film\'s production in Pittsburgh, a local man was arrested for attempting to steal an unmarked police car; he claimed to authorities that he was only an actor and that his crime was actually a scene for the film. Local newspapers later ran the story with the headline, ""Like Batman, car thief\'s story does not fly.""', u'Christopher Nolan is the first director to complete a full trilogy of Batman films, but the second to direct a full trilogy of films on one superhero (after Sam Raimi completed his Spider-Man films).', u""Chlo\xeb Grace Moretz and Jennifer Lawrence auditioned for the role of Jen, Selina Kyle's sidekick."", u'Christopher Nolan used a heavy mask motif through out the movie; Batman, Bane, and Catwoman all wear masks, Bruce Wayne has a collection of African tribal masks in the room, where he and Officer Blake first talk in Wayne Manor, and Miranda Tate hosts a masquerade party.', u'Christopher Nolan offered James Newton Howard the opportunity to write the score with Hans Zimmer as he did for Batman Begins (2005) and The Dark Knight (2008) but Howard felt that due to the collaboration between Nolan and Zimmer on Inception (2010), he would be like a third wheel.', u'Anne Hathaway, who plays Catwoman, had been cast as Black Cat (Felicia Hardy) in The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) in 2010, which at that time was under Sam Raimi\'s direction as ""Spider-Man 4"" and was going to feature the Vulture and Black Cat.', u'According to producer Emma Thomas, the filmmakers elected to shoot the film in Pittsburgh to emphasize Gotham\'s immense size and scope and because ""they literally shot every inch"" in Chicago, where the previous two films were shot.', u'Selina Kyle\'s (Anne Hathaway) relationship with her accomplice (Juno Temple) is highly reminiscent of Kyle\'s relationship with Holly Robinson in the comic ""Batman: Year One."" In that story, Kyle and Robinson had been prostitutes together and even had an implied lesbian relationship before Kyle became Catwoman.', u'The Bat Symbol at the beginning of each film in the trilogy foreshadows something that happens later. In this case the Bat Symbol is made up of cracking ice and it symbolizes people falling through the icy river as they are forced to walk across it.', u'With their appearances in this movie, Christian Bale, Sir Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Cillian Murphy, and Gary Oldman have each appeared in three Batman movies. Only Michael Gough and Pat Hingle have done the same thing in the previous Tim Burton/Joel Schumacher Batman franchise.', u""Around 10,000 extras were used to shoot the Gotham Rogues scene in Heinz Field in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

Early in the film, when Daggett says of Bruce Wayne ""We all know he\'s up there with eight-inch nails and mason jars full of urine"" he\'s making a reference to billionaire Howard Hughes, played by Leonardo DiCaprio in Lent\xe4j\xe4 (2004).

Most are ""character moments"" though some also clarify details of the plot.

She then floods the reactor core and, as in the film, Fox tries to escape, though even the finished scenes of Fox in the film occur earlier in the script version;A longer argument between Blake and the Army blockade on Gotham Bridge. Blake argues with the commanding officer, trying to convince him that Batman has returned and battle has broken out in the city streets.In the script, after Batman harnesses the bomb to The Bat, he\'s never seen again--The Bat simply flies out to sea and the bomb detonates. The scene of Fox and the technicians examining the autopilot of The Bat then follows, with Fox realizing that Batman had ejected before the bomb detonated, and that Bruce Wayne must have survived the explosion.', u'Christian Bale has stated that he would not play Batman if Robin appeared anywhere in the trilogy. Christopher Nolan agreed not to include Robin as it would undermine the dark tone of his series. At the end of the film, Detective John Blake\'s (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) legal name is revealed to be ""Robin"", and he quits the police force and is shown to enter the Batcave by following the instructions presumably left by Bruce Wayne in his will.', u""Leonardo DiCaprio, Ryan Gosling, and Mark Ruffalo were considered to play John Blake before Joseph Gordon-Levitt was ultimately cast.

Her father, Ra\'s al Ghul, repeatedly derides Bruce for lacking ""the courage to do what is necessary"" in Batman Begins (2005)', u'The final chase sequence, and subsequent bombing, where the countdown of the time-bomb is eleven minutes, is depicted in real-time.', u'There are several moments in the film where it is hinted that the child was not Bane. Bane tells Batman he never saw light, until he was already a man. Furthermore, the child who escapes from the pit, is not scarred, despite the fact we know Bane was mistreated within the prison.', u""In the scene at the end where the lawyer's clerk, played by Jillian Armenante, reveals John Blake's real name, the word 'Robin' was dubbed-in post-production to keep this secret from all the crew, including Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who were on-set at the time."", u'At the charity ball, Miranda Tate says ""you must invest if you wish to restore balance to the world,"" hinting at her true identity as Talia. In Batman Begins (2005), Ra\'s al Ghul says that the mission of The League of Shadows is to restore balance to the world.', u""In all three Nolan Batman films, the spiked gauntlets on Batman's arms prove essential in defeating the main villain.

This is very reminiscent to the character Nightwing, the adult version of Robin.', u'Bane has a triangular scar on the side of his head, most visible during the stock exchange scene. Miranda Tate has an identical scar on her back, noticeable during her love scene with Bruce, thus another hint at her membership in the League of Shadows and true identity as Talia.', u""The villainous character portrayed by Liam Neeson Ra's al Ghul, who died by the end of the first movie, makes an appearance before Bruce Wayne's eyes, claiming to be immortal the whole time, only to be revealed as a hallucination. This is a reference to Ra's al Ghul's comic book counterpart, in which the character IS immortal, by the use of Lazarus Pits."", u'During the fight between Bane and Batman in the sewers, Bane lifts Batman above his head and drops him across his knee. This is a direct parallel to the first fight between Batman and Bane from the comics, where Bane broke Batman\'s back during the ""Knightfall"" story line.', u'Some viewers found the scene at the end of the movie ambiguous, in which Alfred sees Bruce and Selina at a caf\xe9. While some took it at face value (that Bruce survived and Alfred really saw him), others thought that Bruce was dead, and saw the caf\xe9 scene as a non-literal fantasy nod to Alfred\'s stated wish from earlier in the movie that Bruce might be able to someday find peace, and a normal life. In a December 2012 interview with the Los Angeles Times, Sir Michael Caine seemed to settle the question when he said that Bruce was supposed to be unambiguously alive during the scene: ""They were there....They were real. There was no imagination. They were real and he was with Anne Hathaway (who played Selina Kyle), the cat lady, and I was happy ever after for him as I told him during the picture."" Furthermore, the film\'s shooting script also specifies, that Bruce is alive during the caf\xe9 scene. A line of spoken dialogue towards the end of the film, also notes that Martha Wayne\'s pearls are missing from the Wayne estate. In the final scene, Selina is seen wearing the necklace.', u""Bane putting his hand on John Daggett's shoulder before killing him was Tom Hardy 's idea."", u'In the film there are a total of five Oscar winners: Christian Bale, Sir Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Marion Cotillard, Anne Hathaway, and four Oscar nominees: Gary Oldman, Tom Conti, Liam Neeson, Tom Hardy Additionally, Oscar nominee Maggie Gyllenhaal appears in archive footage, bringing the total nominees to ten, unprecedented in a comic book film.', u'The soundtrack played when Bruce supposedly died, is the same soundtrack that is played when his parents died in Batman Begins (2005).', u'After The Dark Knight (2008) was released, Aaron Eckhart expressed interest in returning as Harvey ""Two-Face"" Dent. Christopher Nolan stated that Dent was definitely dead, and that his death would leave lasting repercussions across Gotham.', u""The citizens of Gotham make several attempts, without Batman's aid, to rise up against Bane and the League of Shadows. These attempts all fail, because they are caught by members of the League, indicating someone had sold them out. Miranda Tate appears with rebellious citizens in each of these scenes."", u'This is the only Batman film where Jim Gordon learns the true identity of Batman.', u'The original story treatment by David S. Goyer, as outlined before the production of Batman Begins (2005), was to have Two-Face as the principal antagonist for the film. Initially, at the end of The Dark Knight (2008), the Joker would have scarred Harvey Dent at a courtroom trial, setting up the third film. Dent\'s death and fall was put in at the end of the second film instead, to set up the aftermath that follows. Following the release of this film, Nolan elaborated on his choice to include the Two-Face story in the prior film: he wanted each movie to stand on its own as a complete story, and not ""tease"" any sequels--a practice that had become common amongst comic book films. Nolan feels that holding back story or leaving a film open-ended for a sequel, on which to build, is a cheat to the audience, which deserves to see a movie that has consumed all of the filmmakers\' creative energy.', u'It is shown in flashbacks that Bane was still an adult when Miranda was a child. Tom Hardy, who plays Bane, is two years younger than Marion Cotillard, who plays Miranda.', u'When Batman is chasing after Bane for the first time, after the stock exchange robbery, an older policeman tells his younger partner to ""sit back, you\'re in for a show"". This is an almost direct quote from the graphic novel ""Batman: The Dark Knight Returns.""', u'Between Fox, Alfred, Blake, and Gordon, only Blake and Gordon do not discover that Bruce Wayne/Batman survived.', u'In the comics, Bane carried an apparatus that contains a steroid that amplifies his strength and fighting ability. In the film, the apparatus he carries contains an anesthetic, as he is in chronic pain. In both the comics and the film, Batman defeats Bane in a similar way, by damaging his mask, depriving him of the drug.', u'In addition to the numerous elements from the ""Knightfall,"" ""The Dark Knight Returns,"" and ""No Man\'s Land"" storylines, the film also borrows from the ""Legacy"" storyline, which involves Bane becoming Ra\'s Al Ghul\'s successor and plotting with the League of Shadows to destroy Gotham City.', u'This is the only live-action Batman film, where the Bat-signal is never used.', u""According to The Hollywood Reporter, Anne Hathaway's stunt double broke one of the IMAX cameras when she crashed the Batpod into it.

Cotillard started filming one month after she gave birth to her son, Marcel. In October 2010, it was reported that she had turned down the roles of Catwoman and Talia Al Ghul in the film, but as of 2016, there is no official confirmation that she was considered to play Catwoman.', u""John Blake's real name, Robin, is an allusion to the character in Batman comic books, movies, and television shows. Robin was added to the Batman comic books in 1940, to attract younger readers, and the character eventually evolved into a solo superhero, Nightwing. Blake, though an original character, combines elements of the various Robins from the comics - an orphan (like Dick Grayson), a street kid (like Jason Todd), and a skilled detective who deduces Batman's true identity (like Tim Drake), all of whom trained as Batman's sidekick, with the implication that they one day would don the Batman costume."", u'According to Jonathan Nolan, a major influence on the story is Charles Dickens\'s socio-political novel ""A Tale of Two Cities"", which dealt with revolution and class conflict. In an homage to the story, two characters in the film are named Stryver and Barsad, after two similarly named characters in the book. Also, when Commissioner Gordon gives a eulogy for Bruce, he uses the ending soliloquy in regards to Batman, who, like the novel\'s hero Sydney Carton, sacrificed himself to save people.', u""The coloring and shading of the cloth draping the Batman Memorial Statue during its unveiling was similar to the blue colors of Batman's costume as traditionally seen in the comics."", u""In each part of the trilogy, Batman/Bruce Wayne has either a friend who turns into the villain or vice versa:    -Batman Begins (2005): Ra's Al Ghul trains Bruce Wayne, and then turns against him.    -The Dark Knight (2008): Harvey Dent a.k.a. Two-Face is an ally of Bruce Wayne, then afterwards, opposes Batman, blaming him for Rachel's death, and his transformation.    -The Dark Knight Rises (2012): Catwoman/Selina Kyle initially steals from Bruce Wayne (Lamborghini and necklace), then tricks him into Banes underground hiding. Near the end she sides with Batman over Bane.    Also, Miranda is initially an ally of Bruce Wayne and Wayne Enterprises. Near the end, she reveals herself to be a villain all along."", u'Though not shown in the final cut, the fight scene on Gotham City Hall steps, included an explosion that cleared the steps of all the fighters still alive.

He only uses the Bat-pod and the Bat (flying vehicle). While several variations of Tumblers do make an appearance, they are all operated by Bane and his thugs, after they steal them from Wayne Enterprises' Applied Science Division, and these have a desert camouflage paint job, so it could be argued that the Batmobile doesn't make any appearance at all."", u'Christian Bale and Sir Michael Caine spent several weeks filming exterior shots of Wayne Manor at Wollaton Hall, Nottingham, but Christopher Nolan just used one shot of Bale as Batman, in silhouette on the roof, and one shot of Caine at the gravesite.', u'This, and the other live-action Batman film to feature Bane as a villain, Batman & Robin (1997), show the Batman logo during the opening sequence freezing, and then cracking.', u""When the fusion reactor is first introduced in the bunker, the design is almost identical to the microwave emitter design that Ra's Al Ghul stole from Wayne Enterprises and brought into the city in Batman Begins (2005)."", u'It is always alluded that Bane is the child that escapes from The Pit by the use of non-specific terms such as simply ""a child"" rather than ""young boy"" or ""young girl"" and the character having a shaved head. This allusion is fed back to Bruce in the form of the hallucination of Ra\'s Al Ghul.', u""When Officer Blake mentions giant alligators in the sewers, this is a reference to Killer Croc (who makes his big-screen debut in Suicide Squad (2016)).

Inception team similar to roles that are used in filmmaking - Cobb is the Director, Arthur is the Producer, Ariadne is the Production Designer, Eames is the Actor, Saito is the Studio, and Fischer is the Audience. ""In trying to write a team-based creative process, I wrote the one I know,"" said Nolan.', u'In an effort to combat confusion, television broadcasts in Japan include text in the upper-left corner of the screen to remind viewers which level of the dream a specific scene takes place in.', u""In spite of the film's extensive surreal effects sequences, the majority of visual effects throughout the film, such as the Penrose stairs, rotating hallway, mountain avalanche, and zero-gravity sequences, were created through practical methods, not through the use of computer graphics imagery. The film only has around five hundred visual effects shots, as opposed to most other visual effects epics which can have upwards of 2000 visual effects shots."", u""Leonardo DiCaprio was Director Christopher Nolan's and Producer Emma Thomas's only choice for the role of Cobb."", u'If you take the first letters of the main characters\' names - Dom, Robert, Eames, Arthur, Mal and Saito - they spell ""Dreams"".  If you add Peter, Ariadne and Yusuf, the whole makes ""Dreams Pay"", which is what they do for a mind thief.', u'Christopher Nolan first pitched the film to Warner Bros. after the completion of his third feature, Insomnia (2002), and was met with approval from the studio. However, it was not yet written at the time, and Nolan determined that rather than writing it as an assignment, it would be more suitable to his working style, if he wrote it as a speculation script, and then presented it to the studio whenever it was completed. So he went off to write it, thinking it would take ""a couple of months"", but it ultimately took nearly eight years.', u'Joseph Gordon-Levitt performed all but one of his own stunts during the fight scene in the spinning hallway.', u'According to Cinematographer Wally Pfister, Warner Brothers executives approached Christopher Nolan about making the film in 3-D, but he refused the idea, claiming ""it will distract the storytelling experience of Inception"".', u'Joseph Gordon-Levitt went to his audition after a brief character summary, wearing a full suit ""just in case"", unknowingly matching his character\'s wardrobe perfectly.', u'During production, details of the film\'s plot were kept secret. Christopher Nolan, who wrote the script, cryptically described it as a contemporary science fiction action thriller ""set within the architecture of the mind.""', u""Christopher Nolan has said that the snow-based third-level dream was inspired by his favorite James Bond film On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1969)."", u'It took ten years for Christopher Nolan to write the screenplay for this movie.', u""Just like Christopher Nolan's previous movie The Dark Knight (2008), no second unit team was hired for making the movie. All the shots were filmed by Nolan with Wally Pfister."", u'When explaining why he thinks implanting an idea is not possible, Arthur says ""don\'t think about elephants"" to actually make Saito think of them and thus ""insert"" an idea into his mind. The line is a reference to the title of a famous cognitive semantics book, \'Don\'t Think of an Elephant\' by George Lakoff. The book describes conceptual framing, the use of certain words to literally insert certain ideas about a subject into the listener\'s mind in a surreptitious way, e.g. implanting the idea that taxes are a bad thing by using the phrase ""tax relief.""', u'The role of Saito was written exclusively for Ken Watanabe, because Christopher Nolan felt that although he had appeared in Batman Begins (2005), he did not have much screen time, and should therefore be given a more prominent supporting role.', u'""Yusuf"" is the Arabic form of ""Joseph"", the Biblical figure from Genesis 37-50, who had the gift of interpreting dreams. He was sold out by his brothers to slavery. Through his gift of dream interpretation, he helped Pharaoh to prepare for the disaster of the ""seven lean years"" and was rewarded as a result. The same story is also told in the Quran.', u'Dom Cobb\'s main objective is to get Home. Dom is the word for \'home\' in most Slavic languages (e.g. Russian and Croatian), derived from the Latin word ""Domus"". Words like ""domesticated"" and ""domicile"" all share the same ""dom"" root.', u'One of the reasons why Christopher Nolan cast Tom Hardy as Eames was because of his performance in the film RocknRolla (2008). Hardy stated that he thought he was cast because of his role in Bronson (2008). He arrived on set only to learn that Nolan has never even seen Bronson.', u'The movie\'s runtime (2 hours and 28 min) is a reference to the original length of \xc9dith Piaf\'s song ""Non, je ne regrette rien"", which lasts (on its first recorded edition) 2 minutes and 28 seconds.', u'The sixth Christopher Nolan movie (out of the nine) to enter the IMDb Top 250, along with Memento (2000), Batman Begins (2005), The Prestige (2006), The Dark Knight (2008), The Dark Knight Rises (2012), Interstellar (2014) and Dunkirk (2017).', u'The name of the character Cobb references Henry N. Cobb, an American architect notable for designing skyscrapers. The world Cobb and Mal made in Limbo consists mostly of skyscrapers.', u'A direct translation of the lyrics for the song ""Non, je ne regrette rien"" as performed by \xc9dith Piaf is: ""I regret nothing/no, I have no regrets/I regret neither the good things that were done to me nor the bad things/They are all the same to me/...The past is payed, swept away, forgotten/I don\'t care of the past anymore/I set my memories on fire/My agonies, and my pleasures/I don\'t need them any more/Swept away in the agonies of love/Swept away forever, I\'m restarting with nothing..."" Christopher Nolan has made a point of saying that he chose the song specifically for the movie, which is heavily concerned with the effect of memories on the psyche, and specifically the disastrous effect that not letting go of memories of love-gone-wrong can have on the subconscious--exactly what the song discusses. Also of note: in the original French, ""I regret neither the good things done to me nor the bad things"" is ""Ni le bien qu\'on m\'a fait ni le mal,"" and since Cobb\'s wife is named Mal, that gives the line a double meaning.', u""Kate Winslet was approached for the role of Mal, but turned it down, citing that she couldn't see herself as the character."", u'In the city scene on the first level of the dream with Fischer, the state motto on the license plates of the cars reads ""The Alternate State"".', u'The \xc9dith Piaf song ""Non, je ne regrette rien"" is used as a plot device. Marion Cotillard played Piaf in La Vie en Rose (2007). Christopher Nolan has stated that this is ""pure coincidence"". After Cotillard was cast, Nolan intended to change the song to eliminate speculation on the subject, but composer Hans Zimmer persuaded him to keep it.', u'Despite prominent billing, Sir Michael Caine only gets three minutes of screentime.', u'Marion Cotillard\'s character is named \'Mal\', which is short for \'Malorie\', a name derived from the French word \'malheur\', meaning misfortune or unhappiness. The shorter version \'mal\' means wrong/bad or evil (when a noun) in French, as well as some other Latin-based languages. Years after starring in Inception, Cotillard starred in the French film Kaikki mit\xe4 rakastimme (2016), whose original title is ""Mal de Pierres"" (Stone Pain/Stone Ache).', u'Ariadne, in Greek mythology, was the daughter of King Minos of Crete and his queen, Pasipha\xeb. She aided Theseus in overcoming the Minotaur by giving him a ball of red fleece thread that she was spinning, so that he could find his way out of the Minotaur\'s labyrinth. The myth was also the basis for Richard Strauss & Hugo von Hofmannsthal\'s opera ""Ariadne auf Naxos,"" a play within a play, just as the movie is about a dream within a dream.', u'The ""Penrose stairs"" (with a woman perpetually picking up papers) that Arthur shows Ariadne is a reference to a lithograph print by the Dutch graphic artist M.C. Escher. The print is usually called ""Ascending and Descending"" or ""The Infinite Staircase"", and was first printed in March 1960; Escher is well-known for his drawings exploring optical illusions and real architectural, mathematical, and philosophical principles rendered in fantastical ways.', u'Marion Cotillard, Tom Hardy, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Cillian Murphy, and Sir Michael Caine returned to work with Christopher Nolan in The Dark Knight Rises (2012).', u'While shooting the snowmobile chase there were intermittent wind gusts. In order to preserve continuity during the takes without natural wind the camera helicopter was used to blow snow into frame.', u""Just as Cillian Murphy's character was named Robert Fischer as a tribute to champion chess player Bobby Fischer, his father's (Pete Postlethwaite) character is named Maurice Fischer as an homage to artist M.C.

This is all to reinforce the importance of the number throughout the film. Mathematically, the number 528491 is a prime number.', u'Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy co-starred in The Revenant (2015), but this time playing enemies. DiCaprio convinced Hardy to read the script, and do the film with him.', u""The exterior of Fischer's snow fortress is based on, and actually contains some elements of, the Geisel Library at the University of California, San Diego, designed by famed futurist architect William L.

Due to its weight, it cannot be operated hand-held.', u'The theme music for the movie, composed by Hans Zimmer, is named Time.', u'Eames is named after Charles Eames and Ray Eames, a married couple well known in the fields of furniture design, buildings architecture and avant-garde/documentary filmmaking.', u'There is a series of numbers that keep appearing, on the front of the train the number is 3502 and the taxi number is 2305.', u'There are a total of five Academy Award nominees in the cast: Tom Berenger, Tom Hardy, Pete Postlethwaite, Ken Watanabe, and Ellen Page, and three Academy Award Winners: Leonardo DiCaprio, Sir Michael Caine, and Marion Cotillard.', u'Before Ellen Page was offered and accepted the role, Christopher Nolan considered casting Evan Rachel Wood, Emily Blunt, Rachel McAdams, Emma Roberts, Jessy Schram, Taylor Swift, and Carey Mulligan.', u'Prints of the movie were shipped to theaters under the name ""Hour Glass"".', u'When Cobb is on the plane, and is given his passport, the face seen in the photograph is actually that of Christopher Nolan.', u'James Franco was in talks with Christopher Nolan to play Arthur, but was ultimately unavailable, due to scheduling conflicts.', u'This is the fourth of seven Christopher Nolan movies, in which Sir Michael Caine appeared. The others are: Batman Begins (2005), The Prestige (2006), The Dark Knight (2008), The Dark Knight Rises (2012), Interstellar (2014), and Dunkirk (2017).', u'The film uses University College London as a location for a number of scenes, including when Miles introduces Cobb to Ariadne. Not only did Nolan study at the university, he has used it as a location for several of his other films, such as Batman Begins (2005) and The Dark Knight Rises (2012).', u'Except for Dom Cobb, Robert Fischer, and Eames, every other person working in the extraction job, including Saito, are never called by his or her second name in the whole film.', u""Mal's totem, a spinning top, is (probably) a reference to the Clifford D. Simak's story 'Ring Around the Sun' where the spinning top is used as a way to skip from one parallel Earth to another (by way of helping characters to concentrate)."", u'Early in the film, during Mal and Cobb\'s conversation in a room within Saito\'s estate, Mal comments on a painting in the background. Cobb replies stating that Saito ""is partial to postwar British painters"". This is referring to the artist, Francis Bacon. The painting, ""Study for Head of George Dyer"", is of his late lover, whom he painted long after Dyer\'s death to perpetuate his memory.', u'This is the fourth film starring Marion Cotillard to feature a song by \xc9dith Piaf. The previous were Chlo\xe9 (1996) and Love Me If You Dare (2003), both films have ""La Vie en Rose"" in the soundtrack, while Inception has ""Non, je ne regrette rien"".

In fact, a longer flight is Abu Dhabi to Los Angeles, which is 16 hrs and 40mins, compared to 13hrs and 50 mins.', u'Working title: Oliver\'s Arrow, after both Christopher Nolan\'s second son Oliver and the character ""Oliver Queen, Green Arrow"" from a comic book published by DC, who also produces Batman, of whom Nolan made three movies.', u'Included among the ""1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die"", edited by Steven Schneider.', u'Tom Hardy and Cillian Murphy appeared together in Season 2 of Peaky Blinders (2013) in 2014.', u'Cillian Murphy (Robert) doubles for a young Maurice Fischer (with glasses and a mustache) in the bedside photo.', u""The character Cobb is an architect in this movie. The actor Alex Haw, who played another character also named Cobb in Christopher Nolan 's earlier movie Following (1998), is actually an architect in real life."", u""The film contains many cast members from the Dark Knight trilogy, which was also written, directed, and produced by Christopher Nolan - Sir Michael Caine and Cillian Murphy appeared in all three films as Alfred Pennyworth and the Scarecrow, respectively, Ken Watanabe appeared in Batman Begins (2005) as Ra's al Ghul, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Tom Hardy, and Marion Cotillard were in The Dark Knight Rises (2012), as John Blake, Bane, and Miranda Tate, respectively."", u""Don Johnson was Christopher Nolan's first choice for the role of Peter Browning, but he turned it down."", u'In 2014, Harper\'s Bazaar Magazine listed Marion Cotillard\'s Mal as one of the ""Best Film Femme Fatales"".', u'Sir Michael Caine acts in six of Christopher Nolan movies. The music of each Christopher Nolan movie he acts in is composed by Hans Zimmer, except The Prestige (2006), which had music by David Julyan.', u'The word ""Cobol"" from Cobol Engineering, the company Dom Cobb worked, is actually a high level language for business data processing.', u'The music for the third trailer is Mind Heist, composed by Zack Hemsey. He later released an EP ""Mind Heist"" in which each song has a different artwork. The change in the artworks (from a dark area with a rail to a train coming closer to revealing the scene was in a tunnel) is a reference to the scene where Cobb and Mal lay on a rail waiting for a train to come and kill themselves. The names of the songs also referenced this scene.', u'A sample of Leonardo DiCaprio and Marion Cotillard dialogue in the train scene (""You\'re waiting for a train..."") is featured on the song ""Far Away"" by nExow at minute 03:28.', u'In the film, the characters are from five different continents across the globe, performing a major heist. Cobb, Arthur, and Mal are from the U.S. (N. America). Cobb fetches Ariadne from Paris, France (Europe); Eames and Yusuf are from Mombasa (Africa). Saito is from Japan (Asia), and Fischer is from Australia.', u'Lukas Haas plays The Architect, the member of the team who designs the dreamscape i.e. the world of the dream. In Lathe of Heaven (2002) he plays George Orr - a draftsman (similar to an architect) whose dreams change reality.', u'This is the fourth of six movies in which Marion Cotillard played a femme fatale. The others are A Private Affair (2002), A Very Long Engagement (2004), The Black Box (2005), The Dark Knight Rises (2012), and Macbeth (2015).', u'One of Japan\'s famous ""Bullet Trains"" is seen early in the movie. This is a 700 Series Shinkansen on the Tokaido line from Tokyo to Osaka. Its distinctive ""duck bill"" nose and tail design helps to reduce the air piston effect as the train enters tunnels at speed.', u'The two mirror scene with the Droste Effect on the bridge in Paris is a reference to two other films also directed by Christopher Nolan - Memento (2000) and Doodlebug (1997).', u'The character Mal is one of the film\'s main antagonists; in Latin, the root word ""mal"" means ""bad"" or ""evil"".', u""This film has five actors and one actress that appeared in Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy. This includes Tom Hardy, Sir Michael Caine, Marion Cotillard, Ken Watanabe, Cillian Murphy and Joseph Gordon-Levitt."", u'Between them, the cast of Inception currently, as of the 2016 Academy Awards, has four Oscar wins (two for Sir Michael Caine and one each for Leonardo DiCaprio and Marion Cotillard) and eighteen Oscar nominations (six for Caine, five for DiCaprio, two for Cotillard, and one each for Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Ken Watanabe, Tom Berenger, and Pete Postlethwaite)', u""Earl Cameron - listed as playing the 'elderly bald man,' was in the iconic The Prisoner (1967), in which he played the supervisor. The Prisoner is legendary for many reasons, but, in relation to this film, in The Prisoner, the unknown controllers used various methods to find the answer to why N\xb06 resigned - including hallucinatory drugs, as well as entering into, and trying to control - N\xb06's dreams."", u""The painting that Mal stares at in Saito's dream, greatly resembles work done by Francis Bacon. Christopher Nolan and Heath Ledger used Bacon's artwork as a visual reference for the character of The Joker in The Dark Knight (2008)."", u'Ariadne is the name of a figure from Greek mythology who helped Theseus find his way out of the Labyrinth after killing the Minotaur.', u'This began filming under the working title of ""Oliver\'s Arrow"".', u'The cast contains several actors and actresses who started in movies and television as children: Leonardo DiCaprio first started appearing on television, including as a regular in Parenthood (1990) and Growing Pains (1985), as a young teen; Joseph Gordon-Levitt had his first television roles at age seven; by age ten, Ellen Page had started as a regular on the series Pit Pony (1999); and while still in kindergarten, Lukas Haas made his film debut in Testament (1983).', u'The running time of the movie is exactly 8888 seconds in the Blu-ray DVD.', u'When the crew arrives at Level One of Robert Fisher\'s dream, Yusuf is standing on a street corner in the rain. When Yusuf enters the car, Arthur and Eames tease him, because the downpour was the result of his need to urinate after drinking too much champagne, on the ten-hour flight to Los Angeles (""Couldn\'t have peed before you went under?""). Dileep Rao also plays Dr. Max Patel in Avatar (2009), and has a scene with Grace Augustine where she tells him, ""You see, they\'re just pissing on us without even the courtesy of calling it rain.""', u""The father of Robert Fischer is Maurice Fischer; Maurice Micklewhite is the birth name of Sir Michael Caine, who plays Stephan Miles, Cobb's father-in-law."", u""Leonardo DiCaprio, Marion Cotillard, and Ellen Page were all in the long list for a BAFTA nomination in 2011 for their performances in the film. DiCaprio as Best Leading Actor and Cotillard and Page as Best Supporting Actress, respectively, but they didn't make the final cut."", u'Dom is short for Dominick in the film. Sir Michael Caine, who plays his father-in-law, has a daughter named Dominique in real-life.', u'The song ""Non, Je ne Regrette Rien"", which is used as the wake up song, also plays the closing credits of the 2003 film ""The Dreamers"".', u""Miranda Nolan: Christopher Nolan's cousin appears as an air hostess."", u""Christopher Nolan: [Murphy's bag] The third Nolan movie in five years in which Cillian Murphy's character spends a significant portion of his on-screen time with a cloth bag over his head."", u'The slow, gloomy, blaring trombones in the main theme of the film score are actually based on an extremely slowed down version of the fast, high pitched trumpets in the beginning of the \xc9dith Piaf song ""Non, je ne regrette rien,"" which is used as a plot device in the film. Furthermore, when music is heard by someone who is currently within a dream, the music is perceived as slowed down. Thus, the main theme of the film score is almost exactly what the beginning of ""Non, je ne regrette rien"" would sound like to a dreamer. This thematic device is brought to its logical conclusion when the song plays at the end of the credits, signaling that the audience is about to \'wake up\' from the film.', u'During an interview, Christopher Nolan addressed the ambiguous ending, saying he believes Cobb makes it home to his children, although it is open to interpretation by the viewer. He further claimed that the point of not seeing whether or not the top stops spinning is that Cobb no longer obsesses over his dreams.', u""Not counting flashbacks, Cobb's wedding ring only appears in scenes where he is dreaming. Many times in the film, the scene cuts away just as Cobb's left hand comes into view."", u""Ariadne's hair is in a tight bun in the hotel sequence, so filmmakers didn't have to figure out how her hair should move in zero-gravity."", u""When Cobb gave Ariadne the puzzle test, Ariadne's final solution was a diagram of King Minos' Labyrinth. Ariadne is the name of King Minos' daughter in the same mythology."", u'When Cobb asks his kids what they have been doing at the end of the movie they answer (turn on captions), ""building a house on a cliff,"" referring one back to the beginning of the movie of Saito\'s house on a cliff. The movie explains to the audience the significance of Fischer\'s number in that it will subconsciously keep reappearing in dreams (e.g. the phone number, hotel rooms, safe combo); in light of this, the audience can watch the whole movie prepared and notice that the train that ran Cobb and Mal over in Limbo had a number on it. A combination of those numbers is used on the taxi cab that Mal and Cob get out of in the ""real world,"" as well as in their hotel room in the ""real world."" Suppose the whole movie was a dream. If it was, then Nolan cleverly made the movie exactly 2 hours and 28 minutes for a reason, the song continually played to wake people up ""from the dream"" is 2 minutes 28 seconds.', u'This was the last movie shot on film to win an Academy Award for Best Cinematography. All of the winners since were shot digitally until 2016, when La La Land broke the streak.', u'In the end, when Cobb uses his spinning top, the answer (Real vs. Dream) is foreshadowed, when he clears Customs earlier, and you briefly see his left hand as he hands over his passport.', u'Leonardo DiCaprio has stated in an interview, that in his mind, Cobb makes it out to the real world and his kids.', u'Cobb and Mal spent 50 years in limbo. At one point, it is stated that 10 seconds in the first dream world is 3 minutes in the next and 60 minutes in the dream after that. That equates to time increasing roughly 18 times each dream. Since Cobb was able to be in limbo within the 4th dream, if you break down the math, that equates to about 7.5 days for every 10 seconds. Breaking it down further, 50 years would be around 10.5 to 11 hours being asleep. This can be confirmed by the fact that Saito aged into an old man while in limbo during the duration of the flight to Los Angeles.', u'The narrative jumps between dream layers and/or story timeline a total of 223 times.', u'Although Tom Berenger appears in several scenes, the only scene where his character is ""real"" (That is, when he\'s not a projection of someone else\'s subconscious or being impersonated by Eames) is his first appearance in Maurice Fischer\'s office.', u'As Cobb gets off the train, he gives the reason that he hates trains, this is foreshadowing his and Mal\'s time together, as she always says, ""You are waiting for a train"", and that\'s what kills her in limbo, to take them back to real-life.', u'There are 399 questions asked in the film, including ""tag questions"" (i.e. - ""Subconscious is motivated by emotion, right?""). Cobb leads all characters with 113, followed by Ariadne (93), then Arthur (44).', u""Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) intentionally dreams, because he can't let go of his deceased wife. In the 2010 movie, Shutter Island (2010), with Leonardo DiCaprio, he had visions of his deceased wife, and she came to his dreams several times throughout the movie."", u""Leonardo DiCaprio's character couldn't be with the woman he falls in love, in films like Titanic (1997), Revolutionary Road (2008) (both played by Kate Winslet), Romeo + Juliet (1996), Shutter Island (2010), Inception (2010), and The Revenant (2015)."", u'This is the second movie directed by Nolan in which a hospital is blown up.

He\'s a lovely guy and his Joker is going to be a hell of a revelation in this picture."" Caine bases this belief on a scene where the Joker pays a visit to Bruce Wayne\'s penthouse. He\'d never met Ledger before, so when Ledger arrived and performed he gave Caine such a fright, he forgot his lines.', u""In preparation for his role as The Joker, Heath Ledger hid away in a motel room for about six weeks. During this extended stay of seclusion, Ledger delved deep into the psychology of the character. He devoted himself to developing The Joker's every tic, namely the voice and that sadistic-sounding laugh (for the voice, Ledger's goal was to create a tone that didn't echo the work Jack Nicholson did in his 1989 performance as the Joker). Ledger's interpretation of The Joker's appearance was primarily based on the chaotic, disheveled look of punk rocker Sid Vicious combined with the psychotic mannerisms of Malcolm McDowell's character, Alex De Large, from A Clockwork Orange (1971)."", u""Heath Ledger's sudden death from drug toxicity on January 22, 2008 prompted immediate speculation over the film's state and Ledger's disposition prior to death. Soon after Ledger's death was announced, Warner Brothers issued a statement that verified that Ledger had finished all of his scenes in principal photography, as well as post-production fulfillments (i.e., looping), thus making The Joker his final, completed film role. Rumors abounded that playing the intense role had taken its toll on Ledger's mental state, causing him to become depressed and take a wrong combination of drugs as a result. However, his family has since put such rumors to rest, by stating that far from being depressed, he had a lot of fun playing the role. Ledger did suffer from insomnia throughout his life, and would often take sleeping pills together with other prescription drugs (something his sister had actually warned against the night before his death).

The gauntlets had their razors made retractable and able to be fired.

The three he looks at are the thug he kills with a pencil, the policeman stopping the semi-truck before the chase, and the policeman that is clearing the hospital out which he shoots with a pistol while in a nurse uniform.

In The Long Halloween, Batman, Gordon, and Dent fake Dent\'s death; in The Dark Knight, Gordon\'s death is faked. Also in The Long Halloween, Batman poses as a SWAT officer; in the movie, Gordon does. The Joker\'s reference at the end of the film to pushing Dent over the edge, mirrors his social experiment with Gordon in The Killing Joke, in which The Joker attempts to drive Gordon insane by making him have a really bad day. A lot of the interaction between Batman and The Joker is taken from The Long Halloween, specifically the interrogation scene in the film, which is also is similar to elements of The Dark Knight Returns. The copycat Batmen are clearly inspired by The Sons of The Batman from The Dark Knight Returns. Finally, in The Killing Joke, the Joker explains if he ""had a past, it would be multiple choice."" This is referenced when the Joker tells two different stories about the origin of his scars.', u'The infamous interrogation scene originally ended with Batman, after getting the information he needs from the Joker and dropping him on the ground, quickly kicking the Joker in the head right before he leaves to save Rachel, almost as an afterthought. However, this part was removed in editing, because Christopher Nolan felt the action seemed ""a little too petulant for Batman"".', u""After his transformation, Two-Face flips his coin eight times.

In both The Dark Knight and Batman #1, the Joker publicly announces his crimes before committing them, removes his make-up and disguises himself as a police officer to gain access to a person he threatened to kill, uses a powerful bomb smuggled into jail to escape, steals and kills not for personal gain but simply to create chaos and disorder, and infringes upon the city's old-fashioned mobsters."", u'This is the only film in the Dark Knight trilogy, where there is not a surprise revelation as to who was the instigator of the criminal events, and the identity of a villain.

Two-Face falls to his death when he flips his coin. The same things happens in this film.', u'The Joker says that Rachel is located at Avenue X and Cicero. Cicero is a prominent street in Chicago (where a lot of the movie was filmed) located at 4800 West (48 blocks from State Street).', u'The Joker and Batman share numerous scenes, however the Joker and Bruce Wayne never share a scene.', u'All of the main action in this film takes place over nine days and nights, by far the shortest time span of the Dark Knight Trilogy (Batman Begins (2005) takes place over decades, and The Dark Knight Rises (2012) - even when removing the flashbacks that elongate its time span to decades - still covers many months within the main action). The only scenes in the film that are implied to take place outside of these nine days and nights are the brief flash-forwards in the final scene of Harvey Dent\'s funeral (which would probably not take place for at least one week) and Gordon breaking the bat signal. The ""day"" with the most screen time in the film is the final day, which covers forty-eight minutes (a full third of the total runtime). Furthermore, unlike the other films of the trilogy, which contain copious flashbacks, this film only contains one flashback, when Harvey Dent remembers flipping his coin to Rachel while lying in his hospital bed. With that flashback, The Dark Knight not only becomes the only film in the trilogy where Bruce Wayne does not have a flashback, but also the only film where the content of the flashback references a previous scene within the film\'s main action. The flashbacks of the other films all either reference moments that take place outside of the film\'s main action (e.g. a flashback to Wayne\'s childhood), or moments that, while being part of the main action, are shown for the first time in the flashback.', u'Harvey Dent does not appear fully transformed as Two-Face until nearly 102 minutes into the film.', u""Composer James Newton Howard composed an elegant and beautiful score for Harvey Dent, which would serve as a jarring contrast to Two-Face's persona."", u'The hospital that the Joker blows up, was actually an old, out-of-use candy factory in the Chicago suburbs. It was redressed and imploded for the film.', u""In each part of the trilogy Batman/Bruce Wayne has either a friend who turns into the villain, or vice versa. In this one, Harvey Dent a.k.a.

In the aftermath of Harvey Dent\'s transformation into his ""Two Face"" persona, he loses his sense of reason, instead, only discussing matters that relate to Rachel\'s murder and his ""betrayal"" by Gordon and the Batman.

The address number on Pine Street (an actual street in San Francisco) shown does not lie inside zip code 94118."", u""Many of Leonard's unique voiceovers were improvised by Guy Pearce."", u""In one scene, Leonard quickly passes in front of a comic book store. The Batman emblem is displayed prominently on the store's window. Christopher Nolan later directed Batman Begins (2005), The Dark Knight (2008), and The Dark Knight Rises (2012). There is also a Superman emblem in the same store window. Nolan was Producer of Man of Steel (2013) and is Executive Producer of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016)."", u'After Brad Pitt expressed interest in signing up to play Leonard but ultimately had to pass on the project due to other commitments, Christopher Nolan did not consider any other ""A-list actors"" because he realized that having a talented but lesser-known lead actor would allow for the film\'s budget to be more evenly distributed. That process led to Nolan nearly casting Aaron Eckhart in the role, and eventually giving the part to Guy Pearce.', u'When we first see Leonard\'s map of the area, we can see two streets that have commonality with Blue Velvet (1986). There is a ""Booth Street"", the primary antagonist in Blue Velvet (1986) is Frank Booth. A second street, worthy of note, is ""Lincoln Street"", which Jeffrey is explicitly told to avoid, and where the apartment of Dorothy Vallens resides in Blue Velvet (1986). These are the only roads that are not nominally numerical, for example ""Seventh Street"".', u'Carrie-Anne Moss and Callum Keith Rennie both appeared on Due South (1994).', u'The re-release in Barcelona (Phenomena) was in a subtitled version, and a 35 mm copy. It was only projected one day.', u""After his wife's death, Sammy (Stephen Tobolowsky) is shown sitting in a mental institution. Briefly, just after someone walks in front of him, and before the scene cuts back to Leonard (Guy Pearce) on the phone, Sammy is actually replaced by Leonard sitting in the same chair. This supports the conclusion, that the tragic end of Sammy's story, is actually an event from Leonard's own past, just as Teddy (Joe Pantoliano) later tries to convince him."", u'The picture of Leonard that he finds in the envelope under his motel door, shows him pointing at a bare spot on his chest. He tells Natalie that this spot is reserved for when he finds John G. Later, when Leonard is driving to the tattoo parlor, he thinks about his wife, and a flashback is shown in which he is lying in bed with his wife. The bare spot in this shot now contains, ""I\'ve done it.""', u""While Leonard is watching television at Natalie's, a picture of a needle with a person wearing a white v-neck shirt in the background can be seen. In the story of Sammy Jankis, Sammy injects his wife with insulin while he watches television. This alludes to the possibility that Sammy Jankis' story is really Leonard's own. Moreover, the white v-neck in the background, is the same shirt that Leonard's wife wears in another scene."", u""During Leonard's third and final conversation with the anonymous caller, his fingers hover over the numbers 555-0134. This is Teddy's phone number, which is on the bottom of his photograph, thus hinting that Leonard is actually talking to Teddy."", u'Chronology: When numbering the scenes chronologically, then sorting them how they appear in the film, the pattern becomes more clear. The letters A-V will represent the color scenes (with A happening chronologically first, and V chronologically last), and the numbers 1-22 represent the black and white scenes chronologically. The scenes appear in the film like this: 1, V, 2, U, 3, T, 4, S, 5, R, 6, Q...20, C, 21, B, 22/A[1] The two types of scenes alternate. The black and white scenes (numbers) start from the beginning, and work forward to the climax at 22/A, while the color scenes (letters) work backward from the climax at 22/A. The climax scene (22/A) changes to color halfway through, showing the convergence of the two story lines.', u'Before filming the scene where Leonard kills Jimmy, Larry Holden told Guy Pearce to really attack him. Pearce, a former bodybuilder, complied, and left Holden covered in bruises after the scene.', u'Jimmy G. is the name used by Dr. Oliver Sacks to refer to one of his patients in the book ""The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat."" Jimmy G. suffers from retrograde and anterograde amnesia, and is incapable of forming new memories, just as Leonard is. Throughout the movie, Leonard is in search of a man whose name could be John or James G., and in fact, one of his victims is one such ""Jimmy G.""', u'The narrative jumps one hundred thirteen times, from one time period in the story to another. The first scene of the movie is the end of the story, and the story begins in the middle of the movie (when Leonard meets Sammy Jenkis).', u'DIRECTOR TRADEMARK (Christopher Nolan): (Dead wives): Leonard seeks revenge for his dead wife.
