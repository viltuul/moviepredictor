He recognizes that he does not know the limitations of his plane, and asks for the Pilot Operating Handbook. Also correct is the federal requirement to have the POH available on the flight deck at all times. He understands that every plane has an approach and landing speed or it will pancake on touchdown. He almost stalled the plane by slowing down without extending the flaps, but he worked it out, as a competent person would, and he figured out the next alarm quickly about the landing gear. Finally, when faced with an obviously too-high approach, he realized that he did not have the expertise to turn around, as the flight attendant suggested, but he got his bearings and located the small field, at which he was taking lessons, and set the plane down there, even though he ended up off the end of the runway.
