Long considered rivals but always having avoided commenting about each other in the press, Chaplin hired Keaton for a part in this film. Keaton, who was flat broke at the time, went into a career decline after having been signed by MGM in 1928, as the studio would not let him improvise in any of his films nor allow him any writing or directorial input, and he was eventually reduced to writing gags--often uncredited--for other comedians\' films. Chaplin, at this point, felt sorry for him due to his hard luck, but Keaton recognized that, despite Charlie\'s better fortune and far greater wealth, he was (strangely) the more depressed of the two. In one scene in this film, Chaplin\'s character was dying. While the camera was fading away, Keaton was muttering to Chaplin without moving his lips, ""That\'s it, good, wait, don\'t move, wait, good, we\'re through."" In his autobiography Keaton called Chaplin ""the greatest silent comedian of all time.""', u'The rumor has been widely circulated that Buster Keaton was much funnier than Charles Chaplin in their scene together, so Chaplin cut Keaton\'s best scenes. In her book ""Buster Keaton Remembered"", Keaton\'s widow Eleanor Keaton refutes this story; according to her, the rumor was started by Raymond Rohauer, Keaton\'s business partner. The point of the scene was to show Chaplin as Calvero having one final triumph before he has a heart attack and dies.

Welles had been contemplating making a dramatized documentary of the real story of French serial killer Henri Landru.', u'The film was originally meant to be directed by Orson Welles and starring Charles Chaplin, but Chaplin backed out at the last moment, saying that he had never had anyone direct him before and didn\'t want to start. Instead, he bought the screenplay off Welles and re-wrote parts of it, crediting Welles with only the ""idea"".

Worst of all the board also considered Verdoux\'s attitude toward god ""blasphemous"". In a letter of response, scene by scene, Charles Chaplin upheld his screenplay again the charge of subversion, but only giving in on details. For example, when one of Verdoux\'s wives invites him to ""come to bed"" the line had to be replaced with ""get to bed"". Chaplin had no trouble getting around such proscriptions, as he did with Verdoux\'s morning-after ""humming"" with briskly engaging music. The production board complied and gave this film a seal of approval.', u'The producers of the film were sued in 1948 by Parisian bank employee Henri Verdoux.', u'According to Robert Lewis, ""It was easy to define the position held by Charlie Chaplin in the making of \'Monsieur Verdoux\'. He was everything--writer, star, director, producer and casting director, as well as supervisor of all other departments: costumes, scenery, make-up, lighting, shooting schedules, camera set-ups, and the musical score. He also crawled around on the floor with a knife, scraping up bits of old chewing gum stuck to the floor. For good measure he\'d entertain the troops between shots with hilarious imitations, such as William Gillette\'s inanimate playing in ""Sherlock Holmes,"" a Kabuki actor pounding his feet on the floor, and crossing his eyes with pain, or Maurice Schwartz, the Yiddish actor, intoning a speech while twirling an imaginary beard that went clear to the floor.""', u""Charles Chaplin's leading lady in his early silent films, Edna Purviance, tested for the role of Madame Grosnay but was deemed unsuitable.

Curiosity got the best of him, and he had a print brought in through Portugal. History records that he screened it twice, in private, but history did not record his reaction to the film. Charles Chaplin said, ""I\'d give anything to know what he thought of it."" For political reasons in Germany, the ban stayed after the end of WWII until 1958.', u""According to documentaries on the making of the film, Charles Chaplin began to feel more uncomfortable lampooning Adolf Hitler the more he heard of Hitler's actions in Europe.

In the occupied Balkans, members of a resistance group switched the reels in a military cinema and replaced a comedic opera with a copy of this film, which they had smuggled in from Greece.

It would be released there in April 1976.', u'During filming, Charles Chaplin\'s relationship with Paulette Goddard began to deteriorate, but both tried very hard to save it. In 1942, Chaplin proudly introduced her as ""my wife"" (a position that was always considered sketchy) at a New York engagement, but within months they were amicably divorced, and the notoriously finicky Chaplin agreed to a generous divorce settlement. In the 1960s, both Chaplin and Goddard were living in Switzerland, but having made no contact, they spotted each other at a caf\xe9 and had lunch together. It was their last meeting.', u'The German spoken by the dictator is complete nonsense.

Roosevelt sent a representative, Harry Hopkins, to Chaplin to encourage him to make the film.', u'Charles Chaplin cast his wife Paulette Goddard as the female lead, playing a cleaner. He insisted that she scrub the floor of the whole set only for her to refuse. Chaplin stopped filming until she agreed to do so. (Their relationship was on the rocks at this stage, which could explain his treatment of her.)', u'General Dwight D. Eisenhower personally requested French dubbed versions of this film from Charles Chaplin, for distribution in France after the Allied victory there.', u'Production on the film started in 1937, when not nearly as many people believed Nazism was a menace, as was the case when it was released in 1940. However, this film was ultimately upstaged as the first anti-Nazi film satire by The Three Stooges production You Nazty Spy! (1940), which was released nine months earlier.', u'Some of Charles Chaplin\'s associates tried to talk him out of the final speech about peace. One film salesman said the speech would cost him a million dollars at the box office.

Most popular are ""Wienerschnitzel"" (a Viennese style breaded veal cutlet) and ""Sauerkraut"" (a kind of sour preserved cabbage). Others are ""Leberwurst"" and ""Blitzkrieg."" Though some other utterances vaguely resemble words in German, the speech is actually gibberish. Several times in the film, Hynkel utters ""cheese und cracken!"" in the context of an obscenity.', u'Charles Chaplin maintained a closed set throughout production, partly out of fear that other filmmakers would steal his idea. When Life magazine printed an unauthorized photo of him as dictator Adenoid Hynkel, Chaplin sued and won. Half the issues printed for that week were recalled before they could hit news stands.', u'This is the first Charles Chaplin film since The Pilgrim (1923) in which Chaplin plays a character who is actually identified by name. His famous Tramp character was rarely given a name, though he was often referred to as Charlie. The tramp-like barber in this film remains unnamed, but the Tomainian dictator Adenoid Hynkel is referred to by name throughout the film.', u'According to his biographer, David Robinson, Charles Chaplin despised script girls and refused to abide by their guidance, resulting in continuity lapses in this movie.', u'Charles Chaplin spent hours studying films of Adolf Hitler to perfect an imitation of his speaking style. He would eventually do this with a combination of nonsense syllables and isolated German words.', u'The world premiere of the film was held at two packed theaters (the Astor and Capitol) in New York on 15 October 1940. It was a much anticipated gala affair attended by many luminaries, including Alfred E. Smith, James A. Farley, Franklin D. Roosevelt Jr., Fannie Hurst, Charles Laughton and Elsa Lanchester. Charles Chaplin and his wife and co-star Paulette Goddard made an appearance at both theaters. They watched the movie in a loge at the Capitol with H.G. Wells, Constance Collier and Tim Durant, among others.', u'Charles Chaplin planned shots of people all over the world accepting the message of peace, as goose-stepping German soldiers broke in a waltz and Japanese bombers dropped toys on Chinese children. He actually started shooting some of these scenes before abandoning the idea. They survive in home movies shot by his son.', u""As the premiere approached, Charles Chaplin had good reason to be concerned about his gamble on political commentary. Gallup polls revealed that 96% of Americans opposed U.S. involvement in the war in Europe, and threatening letters from Nazi sympathizers poured into the studio. At one point, he even asked a friend with the Longshoreman's Union in New York if they could have some union members present at the opening, to prevent a pro-Nazi demonstration."", u""Some reports refute Charles Chaplin's claims of ignorance as to the true extent of Nazi atrocities, stating that Chaplin was very much aware of the various goings-on, but decided to make the film anyway as an attack on Nazi ideology."", u""The barber's scenes were mostly shot in the slower speed used for silent films (16 frames per second), made possible by the fact that Charles Chaplin gave the character less dialogue than Hynkel, who was shot in the standard speed for sound film."", u""For the first time in years, Charles Chaplin brought in a new director of photography, Karl Struss, to work with his usual cameraman, Roland Totheroh. He did so at the urging of his brother, Syd, who felt that Totheroh's techniques were behind the times. Struss quickly learned that the director preferred to shoot scenes as though they were being performed on stage. He finally convinced Chaplin to let him shoot the scenes from two cameras at once, placed at different angles, to make it easier to edit the film."", u'The ""Big Bertha"" artillery piece mentioned in the beginning of the film was not actually used to shell Paris, as stated in the film. In fact, the Big Bertha was simply a heavy artillery piece used by the Germans in the beginning of the war to smash Belgian forts during the invasion of Belgium. The large howitzer used to shell Paris by the Germans during WWI was simply called ""The Paris Gun.""', u'Charles Chaplin and Jack Oakie enjoyed their roles so much, they often stayed in character after shooting finished for the day. They even attended a party, thrown by Mary Pickford, in full costume.', u'When Jack Oakie (Benzini Napaloni) first visits Adenoid Hynkel (Charles Chaplin) in his palace, Oakie greets Chaplin with a Yiddish expression, which, loosely translated, means ""How\'s it going?""', u""As originally written, Charles Chaplin's final speech, in which the barber is still masquerading as Hynkel, was a call for peace through appeasement. As news reports came in from Europe, however, he re-wrote it as a call for peace and liberty for all. Some critics, most notably columnist Ed Sullivan, claimed that the speech was pure Communist propaganda."", u""Initially, Hynkel's big speech was shot on location in the San Fernando Valley in front of an audience of extras. Despite the extreme heat, Charles Chaplin entertained the extras between shots with scenes from Sherlock Holmes and a variety of pratfalls. In the end, he could not use any of the footage.

Therefore, the song the Tramp sings is in gibberish, but it is possible to follow the story he tells by watching his hand gestures.', u'(at around 1h 25 mins) Discounting later parodies and novelty films, this was the last major American film to make use of silent film conventions, such as title cards for dialogue. The very last dialogue title card of this film (and thus, it can be said, the entire silent era) belongs to The Tramp, who says ""Buck up - never say die! We\'ll get along.""', u""The film originally ended with Charles Chaplin's character suffering a nervous breakdown and being visited in hospital by the gamin, who has now become a nun. This ending was filmed, though apparently only still photographs from the scene exist today (they are included in the 2003 DVD release of the film). Chaplin dropped this ending and shot a different, more hopeful ending instead."", u'(at around 48 mins) Charles Chaplin devoted eight days to filming the department store roller-skating scene where he skates blindfolded on the edge of the fourth floor, coming within inches of falling over the edge into the deep stairwell below. The dangerous large drop was actually a painted scene on a pane of glass carefully placed in front of the camera to align with the existing set and create the illusion of great height.', u'The Little Tramp\'s last words are ""Smile! C\'mon!"" (it is easy to read Charles Chaplin\'s lips at the very end of the film).', u""Supposedly was to be Charles Chaplin's first full sound film, but instead, sound is used in a unique way: we hear spoken voices only when they come from mechanical devices, a symbol of the film's theme of technology and dehumanization. Specifically, voices are heard from: The videophones used by the factory presidentThe phonographic Mechanical SalesmanThe radio in the prison warden's office"", u""This was always intended to be Charles Chaplin's first talkie. He even went as far as writing a dialogue script and experimenting with sound. However, because Chaplin intended the film to feature his Little Tramp character, sound seemed inappropriate. Consequently, the film was made using silent techniques, shot at 18 frames per second and then projected at 24 frames per second, which gave the slapstick sequences a more frenetic feel."", u'This was one of the films which, because of its political sentiments, convinced the House Un-American Activities Committee that Charles Chaplin was a Communist, a charge he adamantly denied.', u'According to Paulette Goddard, Charles Chaplin was deeply and profoundly involved in the recording of the musical score. He spent days upon days in the recording studio writing themes, and only left when Goddard begged him.', u'Another inspiration for the film was a conversation that Charles Chaplin had with Mohandas K. Gandhi, who complained about how machines were taking over. Chaplin told Gandhi, ""I grant that machinery with only the consideration of profit has thrown men out of work and created a great deal of misery, but to use it as a service to humanity ... should be a help and benefit to mankind."" But as they discussed it, Chaplin came to realize it was the first part of his statement-machinery that only considers profits has created a great deal of misery-that mattered most. Gandhi had convinced him without even trying.', u'A screening of the film closed out the 2003 Cannes Film Festival. A high point of the festival, an empty seat was illuminated by a spotlight to honor Charles Chaplin.', u""According to some accounts, working together on the film put a strain on Charles Chaplin and Paulette Goddard's relationship. Contrary to the way young actresses were presented on screen, Goddard was to wear shabby clothing and no make-up as the Gamin. When she showed up for filming with her hair beautifully coiffed, Chaplin dumped a bucket of water over her head."", u'The department store sequence originally had a scene where the Tramp lets one of the ex-factory workers clean out the goods from the silverware department of the store. However, Charles Chaplin later felt this made the petty larceny The Tramp abets too serious a crime, as opposed to stealing food to survive, and he removed it from the final edit.', u'The film is a comment on the increasing industrialization of modern living, something that Charles Chaplin felt exacerbated the grim employment and fiscal conditions of the Depression era.', u'The working title was ""The Masses.""', u'During filming, Paulette Goddard was still working for less than $100 a week as a chorus girl for the Goldwyn Studios.', u""The film shares many themes with Ren\xe9 Clair's \xc0 Nous la Libert\xe9 (1931). That film's production company, Tobis Film, sued Charles Chaplin upon the release of Modern Times (1936) to no avail. They tried again after World War II, this time settling with Chaplin out of court. Clair, who was a great admirer of Chaplin, was thoroughly embarrassed by Tobis Film's course of actions."", u'Co-star Paulette Goddard actually made significant story contributions.', u'A full dialogue script was written for the film, as Charles Chaplin had intended to make a complete talkie. According to a documentary on the DVD release, Chaplin went so far as to film a scene with full dialogue before deciding instead to make a partial talkie.', u'Shooting silent allowed Charles Chaplin the option of cranking the camera at any speed he wanted, sixteen, eighteen, or twenty-four frames per second. This allowed him a flexibility of rhythm and movement in any scene.', u'Although filmmaking had become the province of large teams of highly specialized technicians, Charles Chaplin resisted delegating tasks, involving himself in every aspect of production, even to the point of blowing bubbles in a pail of water to simulate stomach-grumbling sounds.', u'(at around 14 mins) The machine that Charles Chaplin goes through like a film projector was made of rubber and wood rather than steel, but it was still uncomfortable enough that Chaplin only wanted to do it once. To show him going backward again, Chaplin simply played the film backward.', u'According to a fall 1935 issue of Variety, Charles Chaplin was expected to run behind schedule on the release of the movie, as he tweaked the soundtrack. He also wanted to chop over 1,000 feet of film from his then existing cut.', u'Several sequences were cut before release on the recommendation of the Hays Office. According to a January 6, 1936 memo from Joseph Breen, the eliminations needed because of ""vulgarity"" were: ""1) The first part of the \'pansy\' gag [no doubt referring to the jail cellmate whose knitting disconcerts Charlie] 2) The word \'dope\' in a printed title 3) Most of the business of the stomach rumbling on the part of the minister\'s wife and Charlie 4) The entire brassiere gag in the department store 5) The close-up shot of the udders of the cow.""', u'Filming began in October 1934 and finished ten months later in August 1935.', u""Shown as the opening film at the newly restored Silent Movie Theatre (Los Angeles), by Charles Lustman' on November 7th, 1999."", u'Filming lasted ten months. This was considered fast work for a Charles Chaplin film.', u""The elaborate factory and department store sets were built at great expense at Charles Chaplin's studios. Empty lots were rented for street sets, and three streets were built at the San Pedro waterfront."", u'On the recommendation of Eddie Powell, chief assistant to noted composer and musical director Alfred Newman, Charles Chaplin hired David Raksin to help him write and record the score. Only twenty-three years old at the time, Raksin was already a seasoned composer and arranger. After reviewing what Chaplin had composed, Raksin offered the opinion that it wasn\'t good enough for the film, nor was it modern enough or of sufficient ""symphonic dimension."" He was fired after one week, but rehired at Newman\'s urging and allowed to state his case. The rift was quickly patched and from that point, the two worked together well, having great fun coordinating musical ideas directly into the action running on a Moviola, instead of using timing sheets, the usual method of scoring. Raksin said that although Chaplin was not a professional musician, his command of musical styles, instrumental qualities, and development of melody and theme were impressive.', u'The food machine sequence took seven days to film.', u""Paulette Goddard's character's name is Ellen Peterson."", u'Publicity records indicate four hundred people were hired for the caf\xe9 scene, and photographs exist of Charles Chaplin himself, on a high tower, directing hundreds of other extras in the opening crowd shot, as opposed to the usual practice of assigning such a task to a second unit director.', u'By late spring 1935, Charles Chaplin was working sixteen to eighteen hours a day on Modern Times, often sleeping on a cot at the studio.', u'The factory boss was modelled on Henry Ford. Charles Chaplin had met Ford and had seen his industry-changing assembly line process, which had an obvious influence on the film.', u'The main melody Charles Chaplin wrote for the film had lyrics added to it in 1954 by John Turner and Geoffrey Parsons; that\'s when it became known as ""Smile."" Nat \'King\' Cole recorded it and had a #10 hit on the Billboard charts that year. The lyrics (""Smile though your heart is aching/Smile even though it\'s breaking/When there are clouds in the sky/You\'ll get by"") were no doubt inspired by the final moments of the film when Charlie tells the Gamin, ""We\'ll get along,"" and enjoins her to smile. The song has been covered by such diverse performers as Michael Bolton, Eric Clapton, Lyle Lovett, Diana Ross, Tony Bennett, Jimmy Durante, and many others.', u'In 2007, the American Film Institute ranked this as the #78 Greatest Movie of All Time.', u'This was the first picture on which Charles Chaplin used a shooting script. This was so uncharacteristic for him that Variety even featured an article in September 1934, just before shooting began, about how the script and the construction of sets were evidence he was ""through with hit and miss sked."" The article noted that increased production costs and planned location shooting at the San Pedro docks necessitated a faster pace. Predictions that the movie would be completed by the end of 1934, however, proved to be inaccurate.', u""Alfred Newman, musical director for United Artists, was brought in to record and conduct the score. Charles Chaplin had been dissatisfied with the orchestral work on City Lights (1931), so this time he sat in on all recording sessions, interrupting often, ordering retakes, overruling Newman's instructions to the orchestra, and taking the recording sessions into the early morning hours. During one especially tense all-night session, he accused Newman of laziness. The conductor stomped out and never worked with Chaplin again. Newman's assistant, Eddie Powell, took over conducting for the remainder of the work."", u'The film was banned in Nazi Germany for ""communistic tendencies,"" although some said it was due to Charles Chaplin\'s resemblance to Adolf Hitler (exploited a few years later in The Great Dictator (1940)). Still others suggested the Nazis disliked Chaplin because they suspected he was at least part Jewish.', u'The singers in the restaurant are also heard, and some scenes include sound effects.', u""(at around 31 mins) Cecil Reynolds appears briefly in the film as the minister whose wife has digestive issues.

For one thing, the plot device of the Tramp befriending girls who were either homeless or badly down on their luck had been used in such films as The Vagabond (1916), The Circus (1928), City Lights (1931), and later Limelight (1952)."", u'In addition to Charles Chaplin\'s own composition and his uncredited use of the melody of the French ditty ""Titine,"" the score includes snippets of the popular songs ""Hallelujah, I\'m a Bum,"" ""Prisoner\'s Song,"" ""How Dry I Am,"" and ""In the Evening by the Moonlight.""', u'Charles Chaplin wanted critics to see the film with a general audience, so there were no previews and no advance screenings.', u""Gloria DeHaven's film debut."", u'Robert Downey Jr., who was Oscar-nominated for playing Charles Chaplin in the biopic Chaplin (1992), recorded ""Smile"" on his 2004 CD release ""The Futurist.""', u'Henry Bergman, who also played the Caf\xe9 Proprietor, and Carter DeHaven assisted Charles Chaplin with direction.', u'The film premiered at the Rivoli Theater in New York on February 5, 1936. The opening had been delayed by a few weeks because Charles Chaplin felt the picture was not quite ready. He did not attend the premiere because the last time he made a public appearance in New York he ""had a terrible time battling through the crowds"" everywhere he went and dreaded the prospect of ""being stared and pointed at as though I were a freak.""', u'In Austria, censors snipped the scene of The Tramp inadvertently leading the mob with a red flag.', u""Eleven-year-old Gloria DeHaven made her film debut in an uncredited part as one of the Gamin's sisters. Her father, actor-director-producer Carter DeHaven, is credited as assistant director, although some reports say he had a hand in shaping the script as well."", u'In his early notes for the movie, Charles Chaplin briefly considered a story involving rebellious factory workers, ""a drama of communism and everybody getting two cars"".

Chaplin, whose relationship with Cherrill was not friendly, fired her on the spot. He intended to reshoot the film with Georgia Hale, his heroine from The Gold Rush (1925), playing the flower girl; he even reshot the final scene between the tramp and the flower girl with Hale in the role. However, Chaplin had already spent far too much time and money on the project to start over. Knowing this, Cherrill offered to come back to work - at double her original salary. Chaplin reluctantly agreed and the film was completed. (Source: Virginia Cherrill interview, Unknown Chaplin (1983))', u'Virginia Cherrill was very near-sighted. Chaplin felt that her unfocused gaze suggested blindness.', u""In terms of years, this film was Charles Chaplin's longest undertaking. It was in production for over three years, from 31 December 1927 to 22 January 1931, although he only shot for 180 days."", u'The film was inordinately expensive - in excess of $1.5 million - mainly because Charles Chaplin kept his cast and crew on stand-by for 22 months, even though he only actually shot for 179 days.', u'Stanley Kubrick named it as one of his favourite films.', u""Though no footage of Georgia Hale appears in the finished film, the reconciliation scene she shot for him in Virginia Cherrill's absence, has survived."", u'For a subplot, Charles Chaplin first considered a character even lower on the social scale, a black newsboy. The millionaire plot was based on an old idea Chaplin had for a short, where two millionaires pick up the Little Tramp from the city dump and show him a good time in expensive clubs, and then drop him back off at the dump, so when he woke up the Tramp would not know if it was real or a dream. This was rewritten into a millionaire who is a friend of the Tramp when drunk, but does not recognize him when sober.', u""In 2008, this film was voted #1 on AFI's list over the ten best romantic comedies of all time."", u'Charles Chaplin\'s penchant for perfection carried over into all aspects of the production. He had a very clear vision as to how every scene should play. Robert Parrish, who had a small part as one of the newsboys who pelt The Tramp with peashooters, remembered in 1991: ""Chaplin was a dervish. He would blow a pea from the peashooter, playing both my part and the part of Austen Jewell, the other newsboy. He then would run over and react as the Tramp being hit by it, then back to the newsboys and blow another pea. He would then play Virginia Cherrill\'s part of the Blind Girl. Then he was the Tramp. Then he would instruct what the background people should be doing. Everyone watched as he acted out all the parts for us. When he felt he had it all worked out, he reluctantly gave us back our parts...I believe he would have much rather played them all himself if he could.""', u'The plot gradually grew from an initial concept Charles Chaplin had considered after the success of The Circus (1928), where a circus clown goes blind and has to conceal his handicap from his young daughter by pretending that his inability to see are pratfalls.', u""One of Charles Chaplin's most financially successful and critically acclaimed films despite being released well into the sound era."", u'The famous Flower Girl theme was written by Jos\xe9 Padilla.', u'The film was originally set in Paris.', u""One of Charles Chaplin's friends, the famous illustrator Ralph Barton, was on set one day during the filming of the scene where Charlie and the blind girl meet.

""I was 20. Charlie liked them younger.""', u'During the premiere, the theater manager, H.L. Gumbiner, was justifiably proud of the gorgeous new state-of-the-art Los Angeles Theatre. Unfortunately, he had terrible timing. To Charles Chaplin\'s horror, Gumbiner had the film stopped halfway through. ""Before continuing further with this wonderful comedy,"" boomed Gumbiner\'s voice over a loudspeaker to a bewildered audience, ""we would like to take five minutes of your time and point out to you the merits of this beautiful new theater.""Chaplin was livid. ""I could not believe my ears,"" he said. ""I went mad. I leaped from my seat and raced up the aisle: \'Where\'s that stupid son of a bitch of a manager? I\'ll kill him!\'"" The audience was on Chaplin\'s side. They began stomping their feet, calling out, and eventually booing the poorly timed intrusion. Finally getting the message, Gumbiner stopped and the film started back up.', u'Virginia Cherrill was cast on a whim when Charles Chaplin spotted her at a boxing match.', u'Production was delayed on several occasions. In 1929, one break lasted 62 days.', u'The opening reel and a dream vision of Charles Chaplin handsomely uniformed were deleted.', u""Charles Chaplin began shooting the film in 1928. Convinced that sound was just a passing fad, he decided to stick with his trademark pantomimic style. However, halfway through production he realized that the talkies weren't going away, so he shut down the film and tried to figure out how to incorporate sound. He was further hindered by the Wall Street Crash."", u'One of Charles Chaplin\'s most joyous times came during the film\'s famous boxing match scene. ""The filming of the boxing scene was the only social life we had at the studio,"" recalled Virginia Cherrill. ""Charlie must have had over a hundred extras present...and he encouraged his friends in town to come and watch. Everyone loved boxing in Hollywood in those days. And Charlie was so funny in the ring. The boxing scene became sort of a party at the studio. Charlie loved every minute of it.""', u'Everyone in this movie has been dead since 2007.', u'In 2007, the American Film Institute ranked this as the #11 Greatest Movie of All Time.', u'Since Charles Chaplin owned his own studio, he was able to control every aspect of the production. He could take his time and go at his own pace, spending as much time and money as he saw fit to get things done to his satisfaction. He demanded excellence from everyone working with him, but most of all he demanded it of himself.', u'Henry Clive was originally cast as the millionaire, but when he refused to fall into the water in a necessary scene, Charles Chaplin fired him and hired Harry Myers. Some sources say that Clive had a cold at the time and asked Chaplin if they could wait until the sun had warmed the water before getting in. Chaplin responded by promptly replacing him with a new actor.', u'While his demand for perfection could sometimes ruffle feathers, there was no question that Charles Chaplin poured his heart and soul into the pantomime art that he deeply loved. The film\'s poignant final shot was one that he was particularly proud of, having put a great deal of work into it despite its deceptive simplicity. He felt ""a beautiful sensation of not acting, of standing outside myself,"" he said. ""The key was exactly right - slightly embarrassed, delighted about meeting her again - apologetic without getting emotional about it. He was watching and wondering without any effort. It\'s one of the purest inserts - I call them inserts, close-ups - that I\'ve ever done.""', u'Charles Chaplin had interviewed several actresses to play the blind flower girl, but was unimpressed with them all. While seeing a film shoot with bathing women in a Santa Monica beach, he found a casual acquaintance, Virginia Cherrill. She waved and asked if she would ever get the chance to work with him. After a series of poor auditions from other actresses, Chaplin eventually invited her to do a screen test. She was the first actress to subtly and convincingly act blind on camera due to her near-sightedness', u'This marked the first time Charles Chaplin composed the film score to one of his productions.', u""Psychologist Stephen Weissman has hypothesized that the film is highly autobiographical, with the blind girl representing Charles Chaplin's mother, while the drunken millionaire represents Chaplin's father. Weissman also compared many of the film's sets with locations from Chaplin's real childhood, such as the statue in the opening scene resembling St. Mark's Church on Kennington Park Road and Chaplin referring to the waterfront set as the Thames Embankment."", u'Before it was released into theatres, Charles Chaplin had a secret sneak preview screening in downtown Los Angeles. Unfortunately, it was an experience that he described as ""ghastly"" because ""our film was thrown on to the screen to a half-empty house. The audience had come to see a drama and not a comedy, and they did not recover from their bewilderment until halfway through the picture. There were laughs, but feeble ones."" Some of the audience members even walked out in the middle of the film, according to Chaplin. ""I left the theater with a feeling of two years\' work and two million dollars having gone down the drain,"" he said in his autobiography.', u""Charles Chaplin spent $1,500,000 of his own money in making the film. A river was built at Chaplin's studio, which covered an area of five acres and cost $15,000 to construct. Two streets representing a downtown business section were also constructed at a cost of $100,000."", u'The film was given a 4K film transfer for theatrical distribution (Janus Films) and DVD/Blu-ray release (Criterion Collection) in 2013. The Criterion Collection home video release features an optional audio commentary track by Charles Chaplin biographer and archivist Jeffrey Vance.', u'Even though he had great confidence in the film, Charles Chaplin still couldn\'t help but worry that he would be seen as old-fashioned for making a silent picture. Now 40 years old, The Little Tramp, who had been one of the world\'s top box office stars for over a decade, could feel the public\'s interest in his career slowly waning, and it bothered him. ""In the past my work had usually stimulated interest among producers,"" he said in his 1964 autobiography. ""But now they were too preoccupied with the success of the talkies, and as time went on I began to feel outside of things; I guess I had been spoiled.""', u""A scene where The Tramp attempts to retrieve a stick that was stuck in a wall was filmed, but it was removed at Charles Chaplin's insistence."", u'To remind sound-oriented audiences of what to expect from the film, Chaplin billed the film as ""a comedy romance in pantomime written and directed by Charles Chaplin.""', u""According to his autobiography, Charles Chaplin was angered over United Artists' lack of pre-release publicity and decided to exhibit the picture himself.

This judgement resulted from several personal incidents that plagued Chaplin\'s career.', u'The opening scene involved up to 380 extras and was especially stressful for Charles Chaplin to shoot.

Cast members Claire Bloom and Norman Lloyd shared their recollections in a conversation moderated by Chaplin biographer/archivist Jeffrey Vance.', u'Charles Chaplin considered Audrey Hepburn to be his co-star.', u'British music hall comedians Charlie Hall and Charley Rogers have small parts in the film.', u'In once scene, Calvero (Charles Chaplin) quips, ""It\'s the tramp in me"", which is a nod to his Little Tramp character, which propelled him to fame and fortune in a series of silent films.', u'Film debut of Sydney Chaplin.', u""Julian Ludwig, Doris Lloyd (as Terry's Mother) and Trevor Ward were listed in a Hollywood Reporter article as being in the film, but they were not seen in the print."", u'Above Calvero\'s bed there is an old poster that says ""Calvero - Tramp Comedian"", which is a nod to Charles Chaplin\'s most beloved character from the silent era, The Little Tramp.', u'Charles Chaplin and Buster Keaton had an interesting relationship. Long considered rivals but always having avoided commenting about each other in the press, Chaplin hired Keaton for a part in this film. Keaton, who was flat broke at the time, went into a career decline after having been signed by MGM in 1928, as the studio would not let him improvise in any of his films nor allow him any writing or directorial input, and he was eventually reduced to writing gags--often uncredited--for other comedians\' films. Chaplin, at this point, felt sorry for him due to his hard luck, but Keaton recognized that, despite Charlie\'s better fortune and far greater wealth, he was (strangely) the more depressed of the two. In one scene in this film, Chaplin\'s character was dying. While the camera was fading away, Keaton was muttering to Chaplin without moving his lips, ""That\'s it, good, wait, don\'t move, wait, good, we\'re through."" In his autobiography Keaton called Chaplin ""the greatest silent comedian of all time.""', u'The rumor has been widely circulated that Buster Keaton was much funnier than Charles Chaplin in their scene together, so Chaplin cut Keaton\'s best scenes. In her book ""Buster Keaton Remembered"", Keaton\'s widow Eleanor Keaton refutes this story; according to her, the rumor was started by Raymond Rohauer, Keaton\'s business partner. The point of the scene was to show Chaplin as Calvero having one final triumph before he has a heart attack and dies. It would not have made sense for Keaton, who was not even a major character in the movie, to outshine Chaplin.']","[u'UK::16 October 1952 (London)\n (premiere)', u'USA::23 October 1952 (New York City, New York)', u'Argentina::29 October 1952', u'France::31 October 1952', u'Netherlands::6 November 1952', u'USA::13 November 1952 (San Francisco, California)', u'Canada::14 November 1952 (Toronto)', u'Sweden::8 December 1952', u'Belgium::19 December 1952', u'Italy::20 December 1952 (Rome)\n (premiere)', u'Italy::23 December 1952', u'Norway::26 December 1952', u'Japan::18 February 1953', u'Australia::27 February 1953', u'Finland::3 April 1953', u'Denmark::2 October 1953', u'Portugal::2 November 1953', u'West Germany::24 September 1954', u'Turkey::December 1954', u'Spain::18 April 1955 (Madrid)', u'Finland::24 April 1964 (re-release)', u'USA::1972 (Los Angeles, California)', u'Japan::16 March 1974 (re-release)', u'Finland::6 December 1974 (re-release)', u'Hungary::13 February 1975', u'Belgium::25 April 1975 (Gent) (re-release)', u'Germany::11 September 1997 (re-release)', u'Argentina::10 March 2002 (Mar del Plata Film Festival)', u'Norway::26 December 2003 (re-release)', u'Poland::8 November 2013 (re-release)', u'Spain::10 July 2015 (Barcelona) (re-release)', u'Japan::14 October 2016 (Kyoto International Film Festival)']",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Welles had been contemplating making a dramatized documentary of the real story of French serial killer Henri Landru.', u'The film was originally meant to be directed by Orson Welles and starring Charles Chaplin, but Chaplin backed out at the last moment, saying that he had never had anyone direct him before and didn\'t want to start.

Worst of all the board also considered Verdoux\'s attitude toward god ""blasphemous"". In a letter of response, scene by scene, Charles Chaplin upheld his screenplay again the charge of subversion, but only giving in on details. For example, when one of Verdoux\'s wives invites him to ""come to bed"" the line had to be replaced with ""get to bed"". Chaplin had no trouble getting around such proscriptions, as he did with Verdoux\'s morning-after ""humming"" with briskly engaging music. The production board complied and gave this film a seal of approval.', u'The producers of the film were sued in 1948 by Parisian bank employee Henri Verdoux.', u'According to Robert Lewis, ""It was easy to define the position held by Charlie Chaplin in the making of \'Monsieur Verdoux\'. He was everything--writer, star, director, producer and casting director, as well as supervisor of all other departments: costumes, scenery, make-up, lighting, shooting schedules, camera set-ups, and the musical score. He also crawled around on the floor with a knife, scraping up bits of old chewing gum stuck to the floor. For good measure he\'d entertain the troops between shots with hilarious imitations, such as William Gillette\'s inanimate playing in ""Sherlock Holmes,"" a Kabuki actor pounding his feet on the floor, and crossing his eyes with pain, or Maurice Schwartz, the Yiddish actor, intoning a speech while twirling an imaginary beard that went clear to the floor.""', u""Charles Chaplin's leading lady in his early silent films, Edna Purviance, tested for the role of Madame Grosnay but was deemed unsuitable. She hadn't worked with Chaplin since 1923, but was kept on the payroll throughout this time, such was the esteem Chaplin held her in.

It ruined the take."", u'The scene where Charles Chaplin dances with a globe had its origins in a 1928 home movie in which Chaplin also toyed with a globe in similar fashion.', u'Charles Chaplin spent some time attempting to simulate the sound of an airplane motor with various methods, only to be upstaged by one of his sound technicians, who simply went to an airport for the appropriate sounds.', u'During Hynkel\'s speech, there are several recognizable German words used. Most popular are ""Wienerschnitzel"" (a Viennese style breaded veal cutlet) and ""Sauerkraut"" (a kind of sour preserved cabbage). Others are ""Leberwurst"" and ""Blitzkrieg."" Though some other utterances vaguely resemble words in German, the speech is actually gibberish. Several times in the film, Hynkel utters ""cheese und cracken!"" in the context of an obscenity.', u'Charles Chaplin maintained a closed set throughout production, partly out of fear that other filmmakers would steal his idea. When Life magazine printed an unauthorized photo of him as dictator Adenoid Hynkel, Chaplin sued and won. Half the issues printed for that week were recalled before they could hit news stands.', u'This is the first Charles Chaplin film since The Pilgrim (1923) in which Chaplin plays a character who is actually identified by name. His famous Tramp character was rarely given a name, though he was often referred to as Charlie. The tramp-like barber in this film remains unnamed, but the Tomainian dictator Adenoid Hynkel is referred to by name throughout the film.', u'According to his biographer, David Robinson, Charles Chaplin despised script girls and refused to abide by their guidance, resulting in continuity lapses in this movie.', u'Charles Chaplin spent hours studying films of Adolf Hitler to perfect an imitation of his speaking style. He would eventually do this with a combination of nonsense syllables and isolated German words.', u'The world premiere of the film was held at two packed theaters (the Astor and Capitol) in New York on 15 October 1940. It was a much anticipated gala affair attended by many luminaries, including Alfred E. Smith, James A. Farley, Franklin D. Roosevelt Jr., Fannie Hurst, Charles Laughton and Elsa Lanchester. Charles Chaplin and his wife and co-star Paulette Goddard made an appearance at both theaters. They watched the movie in a loge at the Capitol with H.G. Wells, Constance Collier and Tim Durant, among others.', u'Charles Chaplin planned shots of people all over the world accepting the message of peace, as goose-stepping German soldiers broke in a waltz and Japanese bombers dropped toys on Chinese children. He actually started shooting some of these scenes before abandoning the idea. They survive in home movies shot by his son.', u""As the premiere approached, Charles Chaplin had good reason to be concerned about his gamble on political commentary. Gallup polls revealed that 96% of Americans opposed U.S. involvement in the war in Europe, and threatening letters from Nazi sympathizers poured into the studio. At one point, he even asked a friend with the Longshoreman's Union in New York if they could have some union members present at the opening, to prevent a pro-Nazi demonstration."", u""Some reports refute Charles Chaplin's claims of ignorance as to the true extent of Nazi atrocities, stating that Chaplin was very much aware of the various goings-on, but decided to make the film anyway as an attack on Nazi ideology."", u""The barber's scenes were mostly shot in the slower speed used for silent films (16 frames per second), made possible by the fact that Charles Chaplin gave the character less dialogue than Hynkel, who was shot in the standard speed for sound film."", u""For the first time in years, Charles Chaplin brought in a new director of photography, Karl Struss, to work with his usual cameraman, Roland Totheroh. He did so at the urging of his brother, Syd, who felt that Totheroh's techniques were behind the times. Struss quickly learned that the director preferred to shoot scenes as though they were being performed on stage. He finally convinced Chaplin to let him shoot the scenes from two cameras at once, placed at different angles, to make it easier to edit the film."", u'The ""Big Bertha"" artillery piece mentioned in the beginning of the film was not actually used to shell Paris, as stated in the film. In fact, the Big Bertha was simply a heavy artillery piece used by the Germans in the beginning of the war to smash Belgian forts during the invasion of Belgium. The large howitzer used to shell Paris by the Germans during WWI was simply called ""The Paris Gun.""', u'Charles Chaplin and Jack Oakie enjoyed their roles so much, they often stayed in character after shooting finished for the day. They even attended a party, thrown by Mary Pickford, in full costume.', u'When Jack Oakie (Benzini Napaloni) first visits Adenoid Hynkel (Charles Chaplin) in his palace, Oakie greets Chaplin with a Yiddish expression, which, loosely translated, means ""How\'s it going?""', u""As originally written, Charles Chaplin's final speech, in which the barber is still masquerading as Hynkel, was a call for peace through appeasement. As news reports came in from Europe, however, he re-wrote it as a call for peace and liberty for all. Some critics, most notably columnist Ed Sullivan, claimed that the speech was pure Communist propaganda."", u""Initially, Hynkel's big speech was shot on location in the San Fernando Valley in front of an audience of extras. Despite the extreme heat, Charles Chaplin entertained the extras between shots with scenes from Sherlock Holmes and a variety of pratfalls. In the end, he could not use any of the footage. The scene required retakes, and Struss could not match the lighting from the location."", u""To keep the characters separate, Charles Chaplin shot most of his scenes as the barber first, then moved on to Hynkel's scenes."", u'Jack Oakie had been on a diet before filming started. To make him large enough to contrast effectively with Charles Chaplin, the director ordered his cook to fatten Oakie up.', u'Charles Chaplin (Adenoid Hynkel/The Jewish Barber) and Jack Oakie died only twenty-nine days apart. Chaplin died on December 25, 1977 and Oakie on January 23, 1978.', u'The part of the elderly Jewish shopkeeper, Mr. Jaeckel, is played in the film by Maurice Moscovitch, veteran of the Yiddish theater, but his wife, Mrs. Jaeckel, is played by the Emma Dunn, who often played Irish mothers and landladies.', u""Playwright Daniel Lewis James, who was associated via Erwin Piscator with Charles Chaplin's friend Hanns Eisler, helped Chaplin with the screenplay."", u""Hynkel's dance with the globe was originally written as a scene in which he cuts up a map of the world to rearrange the countries the way he wants. When this evolved into the globe dance, Charles Chaplin spent six days over a two month period filming the sequence, plus three days of retakes."", u'Although she had appeared in Modern Times (1936) and her father, Carter DeHaven, appears in this film, Gloria DeHaven does not appear in this film, although she has been credited as appearing in it.', u""The bubble dance was a popular burlesque dance form, dating back to the early 1920s and most likely even earlier.

Therefore, the song the Tramp sings is in gibberish, but it is possible to follow the story he tells by watching his hand gestures.', u'(at around 1h 25 mins) Discounting later parodies and novelty films, this was the last major American film to make use of silent film conventions, such as title cards for dialogue. The very last dialogue title card of this film (and thus, it can be said, the entire silent era) belongs to The Tramp, who says ""Buck up - never say die! We\'ll get along.""', u""The film originally ended with Charles Chaplin's character suffering a nervous breakdown and being visited in hospital by the gamin, who has now become a nun. This ending was filmed, though apparently only still photographs from the scene exist today (they are included in the 2003 DVD release of the film). Chaplin dropped this ending and shot a different, more hopeful ending instead."", u'(at around 48 mins) Charles Chaplin devoted eight days to filming the department store roller-skating scene where he skates blindfolded on the edge of the fourth floor, coming within inches of falling over the edge into the deep stairwell below. The dangerous large drop was actually a painted scene on a pane of glass carefully placed in front of the camera to align with the existing set and create the illusion of great height.', u'The Little Tramp\'s last words are ""Smile!

He even went as far as writing a dialogue script and experimenting with sound. However, because Chaplin intended the film to feature his Little Tramp character, sound seemed inappropriate. Consequently, the film was made using silent techniques, shot at 18 frames per second and then projected at 24 frames per second, which gave the slapstick sequences a more frenetic feel."", u'This was one of the films which, because of its political sentiments, convinced the House Un-American Activities Committee that Charles Chaplin was a Communist, a charge he adamantly denied.', u'According to Paulette Goddard, Charles Chaplin was deeply and profoundly involved in the recording of the musical score. He spent days upon days in the recording studio writing themes, and only left when Goddard begged him.', u'Another inspiration for the film was a conversation that Charles Chaplin had with Mohandas K. Gandhi, who complained about how machines were taking over. Chaplin told Gandhi, ""I grant that machinery with only the consideration of profit has thrown men out of work and created a great deal of misery, but to use it as a service to humanity ... should be a help and benefit to mankind."" But as they discussed it, Chaplin came to realize it was the first part of his statement-machinery that only considers profits has created a great deal of misery-that mattered most. Gandhi had convinced him without even trying.', u'A screening of the film closed out the 2003 Cannes Film Festival. A high point of the festival, an empty seat was illuminated by a spotlight to honor Charles Chaplin.', u""According to some accounts, working together on the film put a strain on Charles Chaplin and Paulette Goddard's relationship. Contrary to the way young actresses were presented on screen, Goddard was to wear shabby clothing and no make-up as the Gamin. When she showed up for filming with her hair beautifully coiffed, Chaplin dumped a bucket of water over her head."", u'The department store sequence originally had a scene where the Tramp lets one of the ex-factory workers clean out the goods from the silverware department of the store. However, Charles Chaplin later felt this made the petty larceny The Tramp abets too serious a crime, as opposed to stealing food to survive, and he removed it from the final edit.', u'The film is a comment on the increasing industrialization of modern living, something that Charles Chaplin felt exacerbated the grim employment and fiscal conditions of the Depression era.', u'The working title was ""The Masses.""', u'During filming, Paulette Goddard was still working for less than $100 a week as a chorus girl for the Goldwyn Studios.', u""The film shares many themes with Ren\xe9 Clair's \xc0 Nous la Libert\xe9 (1931).

According to a documentary on the DVD release, Chaplin went so far as to film a scene with full dialogue before deciding instead to make a partial talkie.', u'Shooting silent allowed Charles Chaplin the option of cranking the camera at any speed he wanted, sixteen, eighteen, or twenty-four frames per second. This allowed him a flexibility of rhythm and movement in any scene.', u'Although filmmaking had become the province of large teams of highly specialized technicians, Charles Chaplin resisted delegating tasks, involving himself in every aspect of production, even to the point of blowing bubbles in a pail of water to simulate stomach-grumbling sounds.', u'(at around 14 mins) The machine that Charles Chaplin goes through like a film projector was made of rubber and wood rather than steel, but it was still uncomfortable enough that Chaplin only wanted to do it once.

Only twenty-three years old at the time, Raksin was already a seasoned composer and arranger. After reviewing what Chaplin had composed, Raksin offered the opinion that it wasn\'t good enough for the film, nor was it modern enough or of sufficient ""symphonic dimension."" He was fired after one week, but rehired at Newman\'s urging and allowed to state his case. The rift was quickly patched and from that point, the two worked together well, having great fun coordinating musical ideas directly into the action running on a Moviola, instead of using timing sheets, the usual method of scoring. Raksin said that although Chaplin was not a professional musician, his command of musical styles, instrumental qualities, and development of melody and theme were impressive.', u'The food machine sequence took seven days to film.', u""Paulette Goddard's character's name is Ellen Peterson."", u'Publicity records indicate four hundred people were hired for the caf\xe9 scene, and photographs exist of Charles Chaplin himself, on a high tower, directing hundreds of other extras in the opening crowd shot, as opposed to the usual practice of assigning such a task to a second unit director.', u'By late spring 1935, Charles Chaplin was working sixteen to eighteen hours a day on Modern Times, often sleeping on a cot at the studio.', u'The factory boss was modelled on Henry Ford. Charles Chaplin had met Ford and had seen his industry-changing assembly line process, which had an obvious influence on the film.', u'The main melody Charles Chaplin wrote for the film had lyrics added to it in 1954 by John Turner and Geoffrey Parsons; that\'s when it became known as ""Smile."" Nat \'King\' Cole recorded it and had a #10 hit on the Billboard charts that year. The lyrics (""Smile though your heart is aching/Smile even though it\'s breaking/When there are clouds in the sky/You\'ll get by"") were no doubt inspired by the final moments of the film when Charlie tells the Gamin, ""We\'ll get along,"" and enjoins her to smile. The song has been covered by such diverse performers as Michael Bolton, Eric Clapton, Lyle Lovett, Diana Ross, Tony Bennett, Jimmy Durante, and many others.', u'In 2007, the American Film Institute ranked this as the #78 Greatest Movie of All Time.', u'This was the first picture on which Charles Chaplin used a shooting script. This was so uncharacteristic for him that Variety even featured an article in September 1934, just before shooting began, about how the script and the construction of sets were evidence he was ""through with hit and miss sked."" The article noted that increased production costs and planned location shooting at the San Pedro docks necessitated a faster pace. Predictions that the movie would be completed by the end of 1934, however, proved to be inaccurate.', u""Alfred Newman, musical director for United Artists, was brought in to record and conduct the score. Charles Chaplin had been dissatisfied with the orchestral work on City Lights (1931), so this time he sat in on all recording sessions, interrupting often, ordering retakes, overruling Newman's instructions to the orchestra, and taking the recording sessions into the early morning hours. During one especially tense all-night session, he accused Newman of laziness. The conductor stomped out and never worked with Chaplin again. Newman's assistant, Eddie Powell, took over conducting for the remainder of the work."", u'The film was banned in Nazi Germany for ""communistic tendencies,"" although some said it was due to Charles Chaplin\'s resemblance to Adolf Hitler (exploited a few years later in The Great Dictator (1940)).

Chaplin, whose relationship with Cherrill was not friendly, fired her on the spot. He intended to reshoot the film with Georgia Hale, his heroine from The Gold Rush (1925), playing the flower girl; he even reshot the final scene between the tramp and the flower girl with Hale in the role. However, Chaplin had already spent far too much time and money on the project to start over. Knowing this, Cherrill offered to come back to work - at double her original salary. Chaplin reluctantly agreed and the film was completed. (Source: Virginia Cherrill interview, Unknown Chaplin (1983))', u'Virginia Cherrill was very near-sighted.

The millionaire plot was based on an old idea Chaplin had for a short, where two millionaires pick up the Little Tramp from the city dump and show him a good time in expensive clubs, and then drop him back off at the dump, so when he woke up the Tramp would not know if it was real or a dream. This was rewritten into a millionaire who is a friend of the Tramp when drunk, but does not recognize him when sober.', u""In 2008, this film was voted #1 on AFI's list over the ten best romantic comedies of all time."", u'Charles Chaplin\'s penchant for perfection carried over into all aspects of the production.

Robert Parrish, who had a small part as one of the newsboys who pelt The Tramp with peashooters, remembered in 1991: ""Chaplin was a dervish. He would blow a pea from the peashooter, playing both my part and the part of Austen Jewell, the other newsboy. He then would run over and react as the Tramp being hit by it, then back to the newsboys and blow another pea. He would then play Virginia Cherrill\'s part of the Blind Girl. Then he was the Tramp. Then he would instruct what the background people should be doing. Everyone watched as he acted out all the parts for us. When he felt he had it all worked out, he reluctantly gave us back our parts...I believe he would have much rather played them all himself if he could.""', u'The plot gradually grew from an initial concept Charles Chaplin had considered after the success of The Circus (1928), where a circus clown goes blind and has to conceal his handicap from his young daughter by pretending that his inability to see are pratfalls.', u""One of Charles Chaplin's most financially successful and critically acclaimed films despite being released well into the sound era."", u'The famous Flower Girl theme was written by Jos\xe9 Padilla.', u'The film was originally set in Paris.', u""One of Charles Chaplin's friends, the famous illustrator Ralph Barton, was on set one day during the filming of the scene where Charlie and the blind girl meet.

""I was 20. Charlie liked them younger.""', u'During the premiere, the theater manager, H.L. Gumbiner, was justifiably proud of the gorgeous new state-of-the-art Los Angeles Theatre. Unfortunately, he had terrible timing. To Charles Chaplin\'s horror, Gumbiner had the film stopped halfway through. ""Before continuing further with this wonderful comedy,"" boomed Gumbiner\'s voice over a loudspeaker to a bewildered audience, ""we would like to take five minutes of your time and point out to you the merits of this beautiful new theater.""Chaplin was livid. ""I could not believe my ears,"" he said. ""I went mad. I leaped from my seat and raced up the aisle: \'Where\'s that stupid son of a bitch of a manager? I\'ll kill him!\'"" The audience was on Chaplin\'s side. They began stomping their feet, calling out, and eventually booing the poorly timed intrusion. Finally getting the message, Gumbiner stopped and the film started back up.', u'Virginia Cherrill was cast on a whim when Charles Chaplin spotted her at a boxing match.', u'Production was delayed on several occasions.

Convinced that sound was just a passing fad, he decided to stick with his trademark pantomimic style. However, halfway through production he realized that the talkies weren't going away, so he shut down the film and tried to figure out how to incorporate sound. He was further hindered by the Wall Street Crash."", u'One of Charles Chaplin\'s most joyous times came during the film\'s famous boxing match scene. ""The filming of the boxing scene was the only social life we had at the studio,"" recalled Virginia Cherrill. ""Charlie must have had over a hundred extras present...and he encouraged his friends in town to come and watch. Everyone loved boxing in Hollywood in those days. And Charlie was so funny in the ring. The boxing scene became sort of a party at the studio. Charlie loved every minute of it.""', u'Everyone in this movie has been dead since 2007.', u'In 2007, the American Film Institute ranked this as the #11 Greatest Movie of All Time.', u'Since Charles Chaplin owned his own studio, he was able to control every aspect of the production. He could take his time and go at his own pace, spending as much time and money as he saw fit to get things done to his satisfaction. He demanded excellence from everyone working with him, but most of all he demanded it of himself.', u'Henry Clive was originally cast as the millionaire, but when he refused to fall into the water in a necessary scene, Charles Chaplin fired him and hired Harry Myers. Some sources say that Clive had a cold at the time and asked Chaplin if they could wait until the sun had warmed the water before getting in. Chaplin responded by promptly replacing him with a new actor.', u'While his demand for perfection could sometimes ruffle feathers, there was no question that Charles Chaplin poured his heart and soul into the pantomime art that he deeply loved. The film\'s poignant final shot was one that he was particularly proud of, having put a great deal of work into it despite its deceptive simplicity. He felt ""a beautiful sensation of not acting, of standing outside myself,"" he said. ""The key was exactly right - slightly embarrassed, delighted about meeting her again - apologetic without getting emotional about it. He was watching and wondering without any effort. It\'s one of the purest inserts - I call them inserts, close-ups - that I\'ve ever done.""', u'Charles Chaplin had interviewed several actresses to play the blind flower girl, but was unimpressed with them all. While seeing a film shoot with bathing women in a Santa Monica beach, he found a casual acquaintance, Virginia Cherrill. She waved and asked if she would ever get the chance to work with him. After a series of poor auditions from other actresses, Chaplin eventually invited her to do a screen test. She was the first actress to subtly and convincingly act blind on camera due to her near-sightedness', u'This marked the first time Charles Chaplin composed the film score to one of his productions.', u""Psychologist Stephen Weissman has hypothesized that the film is highly autobiographical, with the blind girl representing Charles Chaplin's mother, while the drunken millionaire represents Chaplin's father. Weissman also compared many of the film's sets with locations from Chaplin's real childhood, such as the statue in the opening scene resembling St. Mark's Church on Kennington Park Road and Chaplin referring to the waterfront set as the Thames Embankment."", u'Before it was released into theatres, Charles Chaplin had a secret sneak preview screening in downtown Los Angeles. Unfortunately, it was an experience that he described as ""ghastly"" because ""our film was thrown on to the screen to a half-empty house. The audience had come to see a drama and not a comedy, and they did not recover from their bewilderment until halfway through the picture. There were laughs, but feeble ones."" Some of the audience members even walked out in the middle of the film, according to Chaplin. ""I left the theater with a feeling of two years\' work and two million dollars having gone down the drain,"" he said in his autobiography.', u""Charles Chaplin spent $1,500,000 of his own money in making the film. A river was built at Chaplin's studio, which covered an area of five acres and cost $15,000 to construct. Two streets representing a downtown business section were also constructed at a cost of $100,000."", u'The film was given a 4K film transfer for theatrical distribution (Janus Films) and DVD/Blu-ray release (Criterion Collection) in 2013. The Criterion Collection home video release features an optional audio commentary track by Charles Chaplin biographer and archivist Jeffrey Vance.', u'Even though he had great confidence in the film, Charles Chaplin still couldn\'t help but worry that he would be seen as old-fashioned for making a silent picture. Now 40 years old, The Little Tramp, who had been one of the world\'s top box office stars for over a decade, could feel the public\'s interest in his career slowly waning, and it bothered him. ""In the past my work had usually stimulated interest among producers,"" he said in his 1964 autobiography. ""But now they were too preoccupied with the success of the talkies, and as time went on I began to feel outside of things; I guess I had been spoiled.""', u""A scene where The Tramp attempts to retrieve a stick that was stuck in a wall was filmed, but it was removed at Charles Chaplin's insistence."", u'To remind sound-oriented audiences of what to expect from the film, Chaplin billed the film as ""a comedy romance in pantomime written and directed by Charles Chaplin.""', u""According to his autobiography, Charles Chaplin was angered over United Artists' lack of pre-release publicity and decided to exhibit the picture himself.

Cast members Claire Bloom and Norman Lloyd shared their recollections in a conversation moderated by Chaplin biographer/archivist Jeffrey Vance.', u'Charles Chaplin considered Audrey Hepburn to be his co-star.', u'British music hall comedians Charlie Hall and Charley Rogers have small parts in the film.', u'In once scene, Calvero (Charles Chaplin) quips, ""It\'s the tramp in me"", which is a nod to his Little Tramp character, which propelled him to fame and fortune in a series of silent films.', u'Film debut of Sydney Chaplin.', u""Julian Ludwig, Doris Lloyd (as Terry's Mother) and Trevor Ward were listed in a Hollywood Reporter article as being in the film, but they were not seen in the print."", u'Above Calvero\'s bed there is an old poster that says ""Calvero - Tramp Comedian"", which is a nod to Charles Chaplin\'s most beloved character from the silent era, The Little Tramp.', u'Charles Chaplin and Buster Keaton had an interesting relationship. Long considered rivals but always having avoided commenting about each other in the press, Chaplin hired Keaton for a part in this film. Keaton, who was flat broke at the time, went into a career decline after having been signed by MGM in 1928, as the studio would not let him improvise in any of his films nor allow him any writing or directorial input, and he was eventually reduced to writing gags--often uncredited--for other comedians\' films. Chaplin, at this point, felt sorry for him due to his hard luck, but Keaton recognized that, despite Charlie\'s better fortune and far greater wealth, he was (strangely) the more depressed of the two. In one scene in this film, Chaplin\'s character was dying. While the camera was fading away, Keaton was muttering to Chaplin without moving his lips, ""That\'s it, good, wait, don\'t move, wait, good, we\'re through."" In his autobiography Keaton called Chaplin ""the greatest silent comedian of all time.""', u'The rumor has been widely circulated that Buster Keaton was much funnier than Charles Chaplin in their scene together, so Chaplin cut Keaton\'s best scenes. In her book ""Buster Keaton Remembered"", Keaton\'s widow Eleanor Keaton refutes this story; according to her, the rumor was started by Raymond Rohauer, Keaton\'s business partner. The point of the scene was to show Chaplin as Calvero having one final triumph before he has a heart attack and dies. It would not have made sense for Keaton, who was not even a major character in the movie, to outshine Chaplin.']","[u'UK::16 October 1952 (London)\n (premiere)', u'USA::23 October 1952 (New York City, New York)', u'Argentina::29 October 1952', u'France::31 October 1952', u'Netherlands::6 November 1952', u'USA::13 November 1952 (San Francisco, California)', u'Canada::14 November 1952 (Toronto)', u'Sweden::8 December 1952', u'Belgium::19 December 1952', u'Italy::20 December 1952 (Rome)\n (premiere)', u'Italy::23 December 1952', u'Norway::26 December 1952', u'Japan::18 February 1953', u'Australia::27 February 1953', u'Finland::3 April 1953', u'Denmark::2 October 1953', u'Portugal::2 November 1953', u'West Germany::24 September 1954', u'Turkey::December 1954', u'Spain::18 April 1955 (Madrid)', u'Finland::24 April 1964 (re-release)', u'USA::1972 (Los Angeles, California)', u'Japan::16 March 1974 (re-release)', u'Finland::6 December 1974 (re-release)', u'Hungary::13 February 1975', u'Belgium::25 April 1975 (Gent) (re-release)', u'Germany::11 September 1997 (re-release)', u'Argentina::10 March 2002 (Mar del Plata Film Festival)', u'Norway::26 December 2003 (re-release)', u'Poland::8 November 2013 (re-release)', u'Spain::10 July 2015 (Barcelona) (re-release)', u'Japan::14 October 2016 (Kyoto International Film Festival)']",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Worst of all the board also considered Verdoux\'s attitude toward god ""blasphemous"".

For example, when one of Verdoux\'s wives invites him to ""come to bed"" the line had to be replaced with ""get to bed"". Chaplin had no trouble getting around such proscriptions, as he did with Verdoux\'s morning-after ""humming"" with briskly engaging music. The production board complied and gave this film a seal of approval.', u'The producers of the film were sued in 1948 by Parisian bank employee Henri Verdoux.', u'According to Robert Lewis, ""It was easy to define the position held by Charlie Chaplin in the making of \'Monsieur Verdoux\'. He was everything--writer, star, director, producer and casting director, as well as supervisor of all other departments: costumes, scenery, make-up, lighting, shooting schedules, camera set-ups, and the musical score. He also crawled around on the floor with a knife, scraping up bits of old chewing gum stuck to the floor. For good measure he\'d entertain the troops between shots with hilarious imitations, such as William Gillette\'s inanimate playing in ""Sherlock Holmes,"" a Kabuki actor pounding his feet on the floor, and crossing his eyes with pain, or Maurice Schwartz, the Yiddish actor, intoning a speech while twirling an imaginary beard that went clear to the floor.""', u""Charles Chaplin's leading lady in his early silent films, Edna Purviance, tested for the role of Madame Grosnay but was deemed unsuitable.

Though some other utterances vaguely resemble words in German, the speech is actually gibberish. Several times in the film, Hynkel utters ""cheese und cracken!"" in the context of an obscenity.', u'Charles Chaplin maintained a closed set throughout production, partly out of fear that other filmmakers would steal his idea. When Life magazine printed an unauthorized photo of him as dictator Adenoid Hynkel, Chaplin sued and won. Half the issues printed for that week were recalled before they could hit news stands.', u'This is the first Charles Chaplin film since The Pilgrim (1923) in which Chaplin plays a character who is actually identified by name.

The tramp-like barber in this film remains unnamed, but the Tomainian dictator Adenoid Hynkel is referred to by name throughout the film.', u'According to his biographer, David Robinson, Charles Chaplin despised script girls and refused to abide by their guidance, resulting in continuity lapses in this movie.', u'Charles Chaplin spent hours studying films of Adolf Hitler to perfect an imitation of his speaking style. He would eventually do this with a combination of nonsense syllables and isolated German words.', u'The world premiere of the film was held at two packed theaters (the Astor and Capitol) in New York on 15 October 1940. It was a much anticipated gala affair attended by many luminaries, including Alfred E. Smith, James A. Farley, Franklin D. Roosevelt Jr., Fannie Hurst, Charles Laughton and Elsa Lanchester. Charles Chaplin and his wife and co-star Paulette Goddard made an appearance at both theaters. They watched the movie in a loge at the Capitol with H.G.

He actually started shooting some of these scenes before abandoning the idea. They survive in home movies shot by his son.', u""As the premiere approached, Charles Chaplin had good reason to be concerned about his gamble on political commentary. Gallup polls revealed that 96% of Americans opposed U.S. involvement in the war in Europe, and threatening letters from Nazi sympathizers poured into the studio. At one point, he even asked a friend with the Longshoreman's Union in New York if they could have some union members present at the opening, to prevent a pro-Nazi demonstration."", u""Some reports refute Charles Chaplin's claims of ignorance as to the true extent of Nazi atrocities, stating that Chaplin was very much aware of the various goings-on, but decided to make the film anyway as an attack on Nazi ideology."", u""The barber's scenes were mostly shot in the slower speed used for silent films (16 frames per second), made possible by the fact that Charles Chaplin gave the character less dialogue than Hynkel, who was shot in the standard speed for sound film."", u""For the first time in years, Charles Chaplin brought in a new director of photography, Karl Struss, to work with his usual cameraman, Roland Totheroh. He did so at the urging of his brother, Syd, who felt that Totheroh's techniques were behind the times. Struss quickly learned that the director preferred to shoot scenes as though they were being performed on stage. He finally convinced Chaplin to let him shoot the scenes from two cameras at once, placed at different angles, to make it easier to edit the film."", u'The ""Big Bertha"" artillery piece mentioned in the beginning of the film was not actually used to shell Paris, as stated in the film. In fact, the Big Bertha was simply a heavy artillery piece used by the Germans in the beginning of the war to smash Belgian forts during the invasion of Belgium. The large howitzer used to shell Paris by the Germans during WWI was simply called ""The Paris Gun.""', u'Charles Chaplin and Jack Oakie enjoyed their roles so much, they often stayed in character after shooting finished for the day.

As news reports came in from Europe, however, he re-wrote it as a call for peace and liberty for all. Some critics, most notably columnist Ed Sullivan, claimed that the speech was pure Communist propaganda."", u""Initially, Hynkel's big speech was shot on location in the San Fernando Valley in front of an audience of extras. Despite the extreme heat, Charles Chaplin entertained the extras between shots with scenes from Sherlock Holmes and a variety of pratfalls. In the end, he could not use any of the footage. The scene required retakes, and Struss could not match the lighting from the location."", u""To keep the characters separate, Charles Chaplin shot most of his scenes as the barber first, then moved on to Hynkel's scenes."", u'Jack Oakie had been on a diet before filming started. To make him large enough to contrast effectively with Charles Chaplin, the director ordered his cook to fatten Oakie up.', u'Charles Chaplin (Adenoid Hynkel/The Jewish Barber) and Jack Oakie died only twenty-nine days apart. Chaplin died on December 25, 1977 and Oakie on January 23, 1978.', u'The part of the elderly Jewish shopkeeper, Mr. Jaeckel, is played in the film by Maurice Moscovitch, veteran of the Yiddish theater, but his wife, Mrs. Jaeckel, is played by the Emma Dunn, who often played Irish mothers and landladies.', u""Playwright Daniel Lewis James, who was associated via Erwin Piscator with Charles Chaplin's friend Hanns Eisler, helped Chaplin with the screenplay."", u""Hynkel's dance with the globe was originally written as a scene in which he cuts up a map of the world to rearrange the countries the way he wants.

By the 1930s, Sally Rand's bubble dance routine was quite famous. Many members of the movie audience would have recognized Charles Chaplin's globe dance, laughing all the louder."", u'During the climactic speech, the Jewish barber refers to the gospel according to Luke, which is part of the new testament of the Christian bible.']","[u'USA::15 October 1940 (New York City, New York)\n (premiere)', u'USA::23 October 1940 (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania)', u'USA::25 October 1940 (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania)\n (premiere)', u'USA::31 October 1940 (limited)', u'Canada::7 November 1940 (Ottawa)\n (premiere)', u'Canada::8 November 1940 (Montr\xe9al)', u'UK::11 December 1940 (London)', u'Argentina::30 December 1940 (Paran\xe1, Entre R\xedos)', u'Chile::January 1941 (Santiago)', u'Mexico::1 January 1941', u'Uruguay::16 January 1941', u'Indonesia::4 March 1941 (Jakarta)', u'USA::7 March 1941', u'France::4 April 1945', u'Argentina::31 May 1945', u'Belgium::22 June 1945', u'Sweden::19 November 1945', u'Portugal::17 December 1945', u'Ireland::1 February 1946', u'Italy::9 April 1946', u'Hong Kong::27 March 1947', u'Netherlands::1 August 1947', u'Czechoslovakia::10 October 1947', u'Denmark::1 December 1947', u'Norway::20 September 1948', u'Turkey::March 1949', u'Finland::26 May 1950', u'West Germany::26 August 1958', u'Japan::15 October 1960', u'USA::1972 (re-release)', u'Belgium::30 March 1973 (Gent) (re-release)', u'Japan::13 October 1973 (re-release)', u'Finland::21 December 1973 (re-release)', u'Portugal::8 May 1974 (re-release)', u'Spain::30 April 1976 (Madrid)', u'Germany::10 April 1997 (re-release)', u""Norway::5 May 2000 (Kristiansand International Children's Film Festival)"", u'Israel::26 September 2002 (re-release)', u'Belgium::16 October 2002 (re-release)', u'France::16 October 2002 (re-release)', u'Norway::20 October 2002 (Bergen International Film Festival)', u'South Korea::1 November 2002 (re-release)', u'Spain::22 November 2002 (re-release)', u'Norway::22 November 2002 (re-release)', u'Austria::20 December 2002 (limited) (re-release)', u'Italy::20 December 2002 (re-release)', u'Sweden::25 December 2002 (re-release)', u'Czech Republic::16 January 2003 (re-release)', u'Canada::24 January 2003 (Qu\xe9bec) (re-release)', u'Greece::30 May 2003', u'Finland::13 June 2003 (re-release)', u'UK::22 August 2003 (re-release)', u'Ireland::22 August 2003 (re-release)', u'Mexico::13 November 2003 (Muestra Internacional de Cine)', u'Hong Kong::30 November 2003 (Hong Kong Jewish Film Festival)', u'Portugal::26 August 2004 (re-release)', u'Germany::30 December 2004 (re-release)', u'Brazil::23 September 2005 (S\xe3o Paulo) (re-release)', u'Poland::15 February 2008 (re-release)', u'Greece::22 October 2010 (Panorama of European Cinema)', u'Norway::26 August 2011 (St. Hans Haugen Film Festival)', u'Greece::24 May 2012 (re-release)', u'Israel::28 June 2012 (re-release)', u'Portugal::22 January 2015 (re-release)', u'Japan::20 September 2015 (Miyazaki Film Festival)', u'Japan::15 October 2016 (Kyoto International Film Festival)']",0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Therefore, the song the Tramp sings is in gibberish, but it is possible to follow the story he tells by watching his hand gestures.', u'(at around 1h 25 mins) Discounting later parodies and novelty films, this was the last major American film to make use of silent film conventions, such as title cards for dialogue. The very last dialogue title card of this film (and thus, it can be said, the entire silent era) belongs to The Tramp, who says ""Buck up - never say die! We\'ll get along.""', u""The film originally ended with Charles Chaplin's character suffering a nervous breakdown and being visited in hospital by the gamin, who has now become a nun. This ending was filmed, though apparently only still photographs from the scene exist today (they are included in the 2003 DVD release of the film). Chaplin dropped this ending and shot a different, more hopeful ending instead."", u'(at around 48 mins) Charles Chaplin devoted eight days to filming the department store roller-skating scene where he skates blindfolded on the edge of the fourth floor, coming within inches of falling over the edge into the deep stairwell below. The dangerous large drop was actually a painted scene on a pane of glass carefully placed in front of the camera to align with the existing set and create the illusion of great height.', u'The Little Tramp\'s last words are ""Smile! C\'mon!"" (it is easy to read Charles Chaplin\'s lips at the very end of the film).', u""Supposedly was to be Charles Chaplin's first full sound film, but instead, sound is used in a unique way: we hear spoken voices only when they come from mechanical devices, a symbol of the film's theme of technology and dehumanization. Specifically, voices are heard from: The videophones used by the factory presidentThe phonographic Mechanical SalesmanThe radio in the prison warden's office"", u""This was always intended to be Charles Chaplin's first talkie. He even went as far as writing a dialogue script and experimenting with sound. However, because Chaplin intended the film to feature his Little Tramp character, sound seemed inappropriate. Consequently, the film was made using silent techniques, shot at 18 frames per second and then projected at 24 frames per second, which gave the slapstick sequences a more frenetic feel."", u'This was one of the films which, because of its political sentiments, convinced the House Un-American Activities Committee that Charles Chaplin was a Communist, a charge he adamantly denied.', u'According to Paulette Goddard, Charles Chaplin was deeply and profoundly involved in the recording of the musical score. He spent days upon days in the recording studio writing themes, and only left when Goddard begged him.', u'Another inspiration for the film was a conversation that Charles Chaplin had with Mohandas K. Gandhi, who complained about how machines were taking over. Chaplin told Gandhi, ""I grant that machinery with only the consideration of profit has thrown men out of work and created a great deal of misery, but to use it as a service to humanity ... should be a help and benefit to mankind."" But as they discussed it, Chaplin came to realize it was the first part of his statement-machinery that only considers profits has created a great deal of misery-that mattered most. Gandhi had convinced him without even trying.', u'A screening of the film closed out the 2003 Cannes Film Festival. A high point of the festival, an empty seat was illuminated by a spotlight to honor Charles Chaplin.', u""According to some accounts, working together on the film put a strain on Charles Chaplin and Paulette Goddard's relationship. Contrary to the way young actresses were presented on screen, Goddard was to wear shabby clothing and no make-up as the Gamin. When she showed up for filming with her hair beautifully coiffed, Chaplin dumped a bucket of water over her head."", u'The department store sequence originally had a scene where the Tramp lets one of the ex-factory workers clean out the goods from the silverware department of the store. However, Charles Chaplin later felt this made the petty larceny The Tramp abets too serious a crime, as opposed to stealing food to survive, and he removed it from the final edit.', u'The film is a comment on the increasing industrialization of modern living, something that Charles Chaplin felt exacerbated the grim employment and fiscal conditions of the Depression era.', u'The working title was ""The Masses.""', u'During filming, Paulette Goddard was still working for less than $100 a week as a chorus girl for the Goldwyn Studios.', u""The film shares many themes with Ren\xe9 Clair's \xc0 Nous la Libert\xe9 (1931). That film's production company, Tobis Film, sued Charles Chaplin upon the release of Modern Times (1936) to no avail. They tried again after World War II, this time settling with Chaplin out of court. Clair, who was a great admirer of Chaplin, was thoroughly embarrassed by Tobis Film's course of actions."", u'Co-star Paulette Goddard actually made significant story contributions.', u'A full dialogue script was written for the film, as Charles Chaplin had intended to make a complete talkie. According to a documentary on the DVD release, Chaplin went so far as to film a scene with full dialogue before deciding instead to make a partial talkie.', u'Shooting silent allowed Charles Chaplin the option of cranking the camera at any speed he wanted, sixteen, eighteen, or twenty-four frames per second. This allowed him a flexibility of rhythm and movement in any scene.', u'Although filmmaking had become the province of large teams of highly specialized technicians, Charles Chaplin resisted delegating tasks, involving himself in every aspect of production, even to the point of blowing bubbles in a pail of water to simulate stomach-grumbling sounds.', u'(at around 14 mins) The machine that Charles Chaplin goes through like a film projector was made of rubber and wood rather than steel, but it was still uncomfortable enough that Chaplin only wanted to do it once. To show him going backward again, Chaplin simply played the film backward.', u'According to a fall 1935 issue of Variety, Charles Chaplin was expected to run behind schedule on the release of the movie, as he tweaked the soundtrack. He also wanted to chop over 1,000 feet of film from his then existing cut.', u'Several sequences were cut before release on the recommendation of the Hays Office. According to a January 6, 1936 memo from Joseph Breen, the eliminations needed because of ""vulgarity"" were: ""1) The first part of the \'pansy\' gag [no doubt referring to the jail cellmate whose knitting disconcerts Charlie] 2) The word \'dope\' in a printed title 3) Most of the business of the stomach rumbling on the part of the minister\'s wife and Charlie 4) The entire brassiere gag in the department store 5) The close-up shot of the udders of the cow.""', u'Filming began in October 1934 and finished ten months later in August 1935.', u""Shown as the opening film at the newly restored Silent Movie Theatre (Los Angeles), by Charles Lustman' on November 7th, 1999."", u'Filming lasted ten months. This was considered fast work for a Charles Chaplin film.', u""The elaborate factory and department store sets were built at great expense at Charles Chaplin's studios. Empty lots were rented for street sets, and three streets were built at the San Pedro waterfront."", u'On the recommendation of Eddie Powell, chief assistant to noted composer and musical director Alfred Newman, Charles Chaplin hired David Raksin to help him write and record the score. Only twenty-three years old at the time, Raksin was already a seasoned composer and arranger. After reviewing what Chaplin had composed, Raksin offered the opinion that it wasn\'t good enough for the film, nor was it modern enough or of sufficient ""symphonic dimension."" He was fired after one week, but rehired at Newman\'s urging and allowed to state his case. The rift was quickly patched and from that point, the two worked together well, having great fun coordinating musical ideas directly into the action running on a Moviola, instead of using timing sheets, the usual method of scoring. Raksin said that although Chaplin was not a professional musician, his command of musical styles, instrumental qualities, and development of melody and theme were impressive.', u'The food machine sequence took seven days to film.', u""Paulette Goddard's character's name is Ellen Peterson."", u'Publicity records indicate four hundred people were hired for the caf\xe9 scene, and photographs exist of Charles Chaplin himself, on a high tower, directing hundreds of other extras in the opening crowd shot, as opposed to the usual practice of assigning such a task to a second unit director.', u'By late spring 1935, Charles Chaplin was working sixteen to eighteen hours a day on Modern Times, often sleeping on a cot at the studio.', u'The factory boss was modelled on Henry Ford. Charles Chaplin had met Ford and had seen his industry-changing assembly line process, which had an obvious influence on the film.', u'The main melody Charles Chaplin wrote for the film had lyrics added to it in 1954 by John Turner and Geoffrey Parsons; that\'s when it became known as ""Smile."" Nat \'King\' Cole recorded it and had a #10 hit on the Billboard charts that year. The lyrics (""Smile though your heart is aching/Smile even though it\'s breaking/When there are clouds in the sky/You\'ll get by"") were no doubt inspired by the final moments of the film when Charlie tells the Gamin, ""We\'ll get along,"" and enjoins her to smile. The song has been covered by such diverse performers as Michael Bolton, Eric Clapton, Lyle Lovett, Diana Ross, Tony Bennett, Jimmy Durante, and many others.', u'In 2007, the American Film Institute ranked this as the #78 Greatest Movie of All Time.', u'This was the first picture on which Charles Chaplin used a shooting script. This was so uncharacteristic for him that Variety even featured an article in September 1934, just before shooting began, about how the script and the construction of sets were evidence he was ""through with hit and miss sked."" The article noted that increased production costs and planned location shooting at the San Pedro docks necessitated a faster pace. Predictions that the movie would be completed by the end of 1934, however, proved to be inaccurate.', u""Alfred Newman, musical director for United Artists, was brought in to record and conduct the score. Charles Chaplin had been dissatisfied with the orchestral work on City Lights (1931), so this time he sat in on all recording sessions, interrupting often, ordering retakes, overruling Newman's instructions to the orchestra, and taking the recording sessions into the early morning hours. During one especially tense all-night session, he accused Newman of laziness. The conductor stomped out and never worked with Chaplin again. Newman's assistant, Eddie Powell, took over conducting for the remainder of the work."", u'The film was banned in Nazi Germany for ""communistic tendencies,"" although some said it was due to Charles Chaplin\'s resemblance to Adolf Hitler (exploited a few years later in The Great Dictator (1940)). Still others suggested the Nazis disliked Chaplin because they suspected he was at least part Jewish.', u'The singers in the restaurant are also heard, and some scenes include sound effects.', u""(at around 31 mins) Cecil Reynolds appears briefly in the film as the minister whose wife has digestive issues.

For one thing, the plot device of the Tramp befriending girls who were either homeless or badly down on their luck had been used in such films as The Vagabond (1916), The Circus (1928), City Lights (1931), and later Limelight (1952)."", u'In addition to Charles Chaplin\'s own composition and his uncredited use of the melody of the French ditty ""Titine,"" the score includes snippets of the popular songs ""Hallelujah, I\'m a Bum,"" ""Prisoner\'s Song,"" ""How Dry I Am,"" and ""In the Evening by the Moonlight.""', u'Charles Chaplin wanted critics to see the film with a general audience, so there were no previews and no advance screenings.', u""Gloria DeHaven's film debut."", u'Robert Downey Jr., who was Oscar-nominated for playing Charles Chaplin in the biopic Chaplin (1992), recorded ""Smile"" on his 2004 CD release ""The Futurist.""', u'Henry Bergman, who also played the Caf\xe9 Proprietor, and Carter DeHaven assisted Charles Chaplin with direction.', u'The film premiered at the Rivoli Theater in New York on February 5, 1936. The opening had been delayed by a few weeks because Charles Chaplin felt the picture was not quite ready.

Her father, actor-director-producer Carter DeHaven, is credited as assistant director, although some reports say he had a hand in shaping the script as well."", u'In his early notes for the movie, Charles Chaplin briefly considered a story involving rebellious factory workers, ""a drama of communism and everybody getting two cars"".

Chaplin, whose relationship with Cherrill was not friendly, fired her on the spot. He intended to reshoot the film with Georgia Hale, his heroine from The Gold Rush (1925), playing the flower girl; he even reshot the final scene between the tramp and the flower girl with Hale in the role. However, Chaplin had already spent far too much time and money on the project to start over. Knowing this, Cherrill offered to come back to work - at double her original salary. Chaplin reluctantly agreed and the film was completed. (Source: Virginia Cherrill interview, Unknown Chaplin (1983))', u'Virginia Cherrill was very near-sighted. Chaplin felt that her unfocused gaze suggested blindness.', u""In terms of years, this film was Charles Chaplin's longest undertaking. It was in production for over three years, from 31 December 1927 to 22 January 1931, although he only shot for 180 days."", u'The film was inordinately expensive - in excess of $1.5 million - mainly because Charles Chaplin kept his cast and crew on stand-by for 22 months, even though he only actually shot for 179 days.', u'Stanley Kubrick named it as one of his favourite films.', u""Though no footage of Georgia Hale appears in the finished film, the reconciliation scene she shot for him in Virginia Cherrill's absence, has survived."", u'For a subplot, Charles Chaplin first considered a character even lower on the social scale, a black newsboy. The millionaire plot was based on an old idea Chaplin had for a short, where two millionaires pick up the Little Tramp from the city dump and show him a good time in expensive clubs, and then drop him back off at the dump, so when he woke up the Tramp would not know if it was real or a dream. This was rewritten into a millionaire who is a friend of the Tramp when drunk, but does not recognize him when sober.', u""In 2008, this film was voted #1 on AFI's list over the ten best romantic comedies of all time."", u'Charles Chaplin\'s penchant for perfection carried over into all aspects of the production. He had a very clear vision as to how every scene should play. Robert Parrish, who had a small part as one of the newsboys who pelt The Tramp with peashooters, remembered in 1991: ""Chaplin was a dervish. He would blow a pea from the peashooter, playing both my part and the part of Austen Jewell, the other newsboy. He then would run over and react as the Tramp being hit by it, then back to the newsboys and blow another pea. He would then play Virginia Cherrill\'s part of the Blind Girl. Then he was the Tramp. Then he would instruct what the background people should be doing. Everyone watched as he acted out all the parts for us. When he felt he had it all worked out, he reluctantly gave us back our parts...I believe he would have much rather played them all himself if he could.""', u'The plot gradually grew from an initial concept Charles Chaplin had considered after the success of The Circus (1928), where a circus clown goes blind and has to conceal his handicap from his young daughter by pretending that his inability to see are pratfalls.', u""One of Charles Chaplin's most financially successful and critically acclaimed films despite being released well into the sound era."", u'The famous Flower Girl theme was written by Jos\xe9 Padilla.', u'The film was originally set in Paris.', u""One of Charles Chaplin's friends, the famous illustrator Ralph Barton, was on set one day during the filming of the scene where Charlie and the blind girl meet.

""I was 20. Charlie liked them younger.""', u'During the premiere, the theater manager, H.L. Gumbiner, was justifiably proud of the gorgeous new state-of-the-art Los Angeles Theatre. Unfortunately, he had terrible timing. To Charles Chaplin\'s horror, Gumbiner had the film stopped halfway through. ""Before continuing further with this wonderful comedy,"" boomed Gumbiner\'s voice over a loudspeaker to a bewildered audience, ""we would like to take five minutes of your time and point out to you the merits of this beautiful new theater.""Chaplin was livid. ""I could not believe my ears,"" he said. ""I went mad. I leaped from my seat and raced up the aisle: \'Where\'s that stupid son of a bitch of a manager? I\'ll kill him!\'"" The audience was on Chaplin\'s side. They began stomping their feet, calling out, and eventually booing the poorly timed intrusion. Finally getting the message, Gumbiner stopped and the film started back up.', u'Virginia Cherrill was cast on a whim when Charles Chaplin spotted her at a boxing match.', u'Production was delayed on several occasions. In 1929, one break lasted 62 days.', u'The opening reel and a dream vision of Charles Chaplin handsomely uniformed were deleted.', u""Charles Chaplin began shooting the film in 1928. Convinced that sound was just a passing fad, he decided to stick with his trademark pantomimic style. However, halfway through production he realized that the talkies weren't going away, so he shut down the film and tried to figure out how to incorporate sound. He was further hindered by the Wall Street Crash."", u'One of Charles Chaplin\'s most joyous times came during the film\'s famous boxing match scene. ""The filming of the boxing scene was the only social life we had at the studio,"" recalled Virginia Cherrill. ""Charlie must have had over a hundred extras present...and he encouraged his friends in town to come and watch. Everyone loved boxing in Hollywood in those days. And Charlie was so funny in the ring. The boxing scene became sort of a party at the studio. Charlie loved every minute of it.""', u'Everyone in this movie has been dead since 2007.', u'In 2007, the American Film Institute ranked this as the #11 Greatest Movie of All Time.', u'Since Charles Chaplin owned his own studio, he was able to control every aspect of the production. He could take his time and go at his own pace, spending as much time and money as he saw fit to get things done to his satisfaction. He demanded excellence from everyone working with him, but most of all he demanded it of himself.', u'Henry Clive was originally cast as the millionaire, but when he refused to fall into the water in a necessary scene, Charles Chaplin fired him and hired Harry Myers. Some sources say that Clive had a cold at the time and asked Chaplin if they could wait until the sun had warmed the water before getting in. Chaplin responded by promptly replacing him with a new actor.', u'While his demand for perfection could sometimes ruffle feathers, there was no question that Charles Chaplin poured his heart and soul into the pantomime art that he deeply loved. The film\'s poignant final shot was one that he was particularly proud of, having put a great deal of work into it despite its deceptive simplicity. He felt ""a beautiful sensation of not acting, of standing outside myself,"" he said. ""The key was exactly right - slightly embarrassed, delighted about meeting her again - apologetic without getting emotional about it. He was watching and wondering without any effort. It\'s one of the purest inserts - I call them inserts, close-ups - that I\'ve ever done.""', u'Charles Chaplin had interviewed several actresses to play the blind flower girl, but was unimpressed with them all. While seeing a film shoot with bathing women in a Santa Monica beach, he found a casual acquaintance, Virginia Cherrill. She waved and asked if she would ever get the chance to work with him. After a series of poor auditions from other actresses, Chaplin eventually invited her to do a screen test. She was the first actress to subtly and convincingly act blind on camera due to her near-sightedness', u'This marked the first time Charles Chaplin composed the film score to one of his productions.', u""Psychologist Stephen Weissman has hypothesized that the film is highly autobiographical, with the blind girl representing Charles Chaplin's mother, while the drunken millionaire represents Chaplin's father. Weissman also compared many of the film's sets with locations from Chaplin's real childhood, such as the statue in the opening scene resembling St. Mark's Church on Kennington Park Road and Chaplin referring to the waterfront set as the Thames Embankment."", u'Before it was released into theatres, Charles Chaplin had a secret sneak preview screening in downtown Los Angeles. Unfortunately, it was an experience that he described as ""ghastly"" because ""our film was thrown on to the screen to a half-empty house. The audience had come to see a drama and not a comedy, and they did not recover from their bewilderment until halfway through the picture. There were laughs, but feeble ones."" Some of the audience members even walked out in the middle of the film, according to Chaplin. ""I left the theater with a feeling of two years\' work and two million dollars having gone down the drain,"" he said in his autobiography.', u""Charles Chaplin spent $1,500,000 of his own money in making the film. A river was built at Chaplin's studio, which covered an area of five acres and cost $15,000 to construct. Two streets representing a downtown business section were also constructed at a cost of $100,000."", u'The film was given a 4K film transfer for theatrical distribution (Janus Films) and DVD/Blu-ray release (Criterion Collection) in 2013. The Criterion Collection home video release features an optional audio commentary track by Charles Chaplin biographer and archivist Jeffrey Vance.', u'Even though he had great confidence in the film, Charles Chaplin still couldn\'t help but worry that he would be seen as old-fashioned for making a silent picture. Now 40 years old, The Little Tramp, who had been one of the world\'s top box office stars for over a decade, could feel the public\'s interest in his career slowly waning, and it bothered him. ""In the past my work had usually stimulated interest among producers,"" he said in his 1964 autobiography. ""But now they were too preoccupied with the success of the talkies, and as time went on I began to feel outside of things; I guess I had been spoiled.""', u""A scene where The Tramp attempts to retrieve a stick that was stuck in a wall was filmed, but it was removed at Charles Chaplin's insistence."", u'To remind sound-oriented audiences of what to expect from the film, Chaplin billed the film as ""a comedy romance in pantomime written and directed by Charles Chaplin.""', u""According to his autobiography, Charles Chaplin was angered over United Artists' lack of pre-release publicity and decided to exhibit the picture himself.

Cast members Claire Bloom and Norman Lloyd shared their recollections in a conversation moderated by Chaplin biographer/archivist Jeffrey Vance.', u'Charles Chaplin considered Audrey Hepburn to be his co-star.', u'British music hall comedians Charlie Hall and Charley Rogers have small parts in the film.', u'In once scene, Calvero (Charles Chaplin) quips, ""It\'s the tramp in me"", which is a nod to his Little Tramp character, which propelled him to fame and fortune in a series of silent films.', u'Film debut of Sydney Chaplin.', u""Julian Ludwig, Doris Lloyd (as Terry's Mother) and Trevor Ward were listed in a Hollywood Reporter article as being in the film, but they were not seen in the print."", u'Above Calvero\'s bed there is an old poster that says ""Calvero - Tramp Comedian"", which is a nod to Charles Chaplin\'s most beloved character from the silent era, The Little Tramp.', u'Charles Chaplin and Buster Keaton had an interesting relationship. Long considered rivals but always having avoided commenting about each other in the press, Chaplin hired Keaton for a part in this film. Keaton, who was flat broke at the time, went into a career decline after having been signed by MGM in 1928, as the studio would not let him improvise in any of his films nor allow him any writing or directorial input, and he was eventually reduced to writing gags--often uncredited--for other comedians\' films. Chaplin, at this point, felt sorry for him due to his hard luck, but Keaton recognized that, despite Charlie\'s better fortune and far greater wealth, he was (strangely) the more depressed of the two. In one scene in this film, Chaplin\'s character was dying. While the camera was fading away, Keaton was muttering to Chaplin without moving his lips, ""That\'s it, good, wait, don\'t move, wait, good, we\'re through."" In his autobiography Keaton called Chaplin ""the greatest silent comedian of all time.""', u'The rumor has been widely circulated that Buster Keaton was much funnier than Charles Chaplin in their scene together, so Chaplin cut Keaton\'s best scenes. In her book ""Buster Keaton Remembered"", Keaton\'s widow Eleanor Keaton refutes this story; according to her, the rumor was started by Raymond Rohauer, Keaton\'s business partner. The point of the scene was to show Chaplin as Calvero having one final triumph before he has a heart attack and dies. It would not have made sense for Keaton, who was not even a major character in the movie, to outshine Chaplin.']","[u'UK::16 October 1952 (London)\n (premiere)', u'USA::23 October 1952 (New York City, New York)', u'Argentina::29 October 1952', u'France::31 October 1952', u'Netherlands::6 November 1952', u'USA::13 November 1952 (San Francisco, California)', u'Canada::14 November 1952 (Toronto)', u'Sweden::8 December 1952', u'Belgium::19 December 1952', u'Italy::20 December 1952 (Rome)\n (premiere)', u'Italy::23 December 1952', u'Norway::26 December 1952', u'Japan::18 February 1953', u'Australia::27 February 1953', u'Finland::3 April 1953', u'Denmark::2 October 1953', u'Portugal::2 November 1953', u'West Germany::24 September 1954', u'Turkey::December 1954', u'Spain::18 April 1955 (Madrid)', u'Finland::24 April 1964 (re-release)', u'USA::1972 (Los Angeles, California)', u'Japan::16 March 1974 (re-release)', u'Finland::6 December 1974 (re-release)', u'Hungary::13 February 1975', u'Belgium::25 April 1975 (Gent) (re-release)', u'Germany::11 September 1997 (re-release)', u'Argentina::10 March 2002 (Mar del Plata Film Festival)', u'Norway::26 December 2003 (re-release)', u'Poland::8 November 2013 (re-release)', u'Spain::10 July 2015 (Barcelona) (re-release)', u'Japan::14 October 2016 (Kyoto International Film Festival)']",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Welles had been contemplating making a dramatized documentary of the real story of French serial killer Henri Landru.', u'The film was originally meant to be directed by Orson Welles and starring Charles Chaplin, but Chaplin backed out at the last moment, saying that he had never had anyone direct him before and didn\'t want to start.

Worst of all the board also considered Verdoux\'s attitude toward god ""blasphemous"". In a letter of response, scene by scene, Charles Chaplin upheld his screenplay again the charge of subversion, but only giving in on details. For example, when one of Verdoux\'s wives invites him to ""come to bed"" the line had to be replaced with ""get to bed"". Chaplin had no trouble getting around such proscriptions, as he did with Verdoux\'s morning-after ""humming"" with briskly engaging music. The production board complied and gave this film a seal of approval.', u'The producers of the film were sued in 1948 by Parisian bank employee Henri Verdoux.', u'According to Robert Lewis, ""It was easy to define the position held by Charlie Chaplin in the making of \'Monsieur Verdoux\'. He was everything--writer, star, director, producer and casting director, as well as supervisor of all other departments: costumes, scenery, make-up, lighting, shooting schedules, camera set-ups, and the musical score. He also crawled around on the floor with a knife, scraping up bits of old chewing gum stuck to the floor. For good measure he\'d entertain the troops between shots with hilarious imitations, such as William Gillette\'s inanimate playing in ""Sherlock Holmes,"" a Kabuki actor pounding his feet on the floor, and crossing his eyes with pain, or Maurice Schwartz, the Yiddish actor, intoning a speech while twirling an imaginary beard that went clear to the floor.""', u""Charles Chaplin's leading lady in his early silent films, Edna Purviance, tested for the role of Madame Grosnay but was deemed unsuitable.

It ruined the take."", u'The scene where Charles Chaplin dances with a globe had its origins in a 1928 home movie in which Chaplin also toyed with a globe in similar fashion.', u'Charles Chaplin spent some time attempting to simulate the sound of an airplane motor with various methods, only to be upstaged by one of his sound technicians, who simply went to an airport for the appropriate sounds.', u'During Hynkel\'s speech, there are several recognizable German words used. Most popular are ""Wienerschnitzel"" (a Viennese style breaded veal cutlet) and ""Sauerkraut"" (a kind of sour preserved cabbage). Others are ""Leberwurst"" and ""Blitzkrieg."" Though some other utterances vaguely resemble words in German, the speech is actually gibberish. Several times in the film, Hynkel utters ""cheese und cracken!"" in the context of an obscenity.', u'Charles Chaplin maintained a closed set throughout production, partly out of fear that other filmmakers would steal his idea. When Life magazine printed an unauthorized photo of him as dictator Adenoid Hynkel, Chaplin sued and won. Half the issues printed for that week were recalled before they could hit news stands.', u'This is the first Charles Chaplin film since The Pilgrim (1923) in which Chaplin plays a character who is actually identified by name. His famous Tramp character was rarely given a name, though he was often referred to as Charlie. The tramp-like barber in this film remains unnamed, but the Tomainian dictator Adenoid Hynkel is referred to by name throughout the film.', u'According to his biographer, David Robinson, Charles Chaplin despised script girls and refused to abide by their guidance, resulting in continuity lapses in this movie.', u'Charles Chaplin spent hours studying films of Adolf Hitler to perfect an imitation of his speaking style. He would eventually do this with a combination of nonsense syllables and isolated German words.', u'The world premiere of the film was held at two packed theaters (the Astor and Capitol) in New York on 15 October 1940. It was a much anticipated gala affair attended by many luminaries, including Alfred E. Smith, James A. Farley, Franklin D. Roosevelt Jr., Fannie Hurst, Charles Laughton and Elsa Lanchester. Charles Chaplin and his wife and co-star Paulette Goddard made an appearance at both theaters. They watched the movie in a loge at the Capitol with H.G. Wells, Constance Collier and Tim Durant, among others.', u'Charles Chaplin planned shots of people all over the world accepting the message of peace, as goose-stepping German soldiers broke in a waltz and Japanese bombers dropped toys on Chinese children. He actually started shooting some of these scenes before abandoning the idea. They survive in home movies shot by his son.', u""As the premiere approached, Charles Chaplin had good reason to be concerned about his gamble on political commentary. Gallup polls revealed that 96% of Americans opposed U.S. involvement in the war in Europe, and threatening letters from Nazi sympathizers poured into the studio. At one point, he even asked a friend with the Longshoreman's Union in New York if they could have some union members present at the opening, to prevent a pro-Nazi demonstration."", u""Some reports refute Charles Chaplin's claims of ignorance as to the true extent of Nazi atrocities, stating that Chaplin was very much aware of the various goings-on, but decided to make the film anyway as an attack on Nazi ideology."", u""The barber's scenes were mostly shot in the slower speed used for silent films (16 frames per second), made possible by the fact that Charles Chaplin gave the character less dialogue than Hynkel, who was shot in the standard speed for sound film."", u""For the first time in years, Charles Chaplin brought in a new director of photography, Karl Struss, to work with his usual cameraman, Roland Totheroh. He did so at the urging of his brother, Syd, who felt that Totheroh's techniques were behind the times. Struss quickly learned that the director preferred to shoot scenes as though they were being performed on stage. He finally convinced Chaplin to let him shoot the scenes from two cameras at once, placed at different angles, to make it easier to edit the film."", u'The ""Big Bertha"" artillery piece mentioned in the beginning of the film was not actually used to shell Paris, as stated in the film. In fact, the Big Bertha was simply a heavy artillery piece used by the Germans in the beginning of the war to smash Belgian forts during the invasion of Belgium. The large howitzer used to shell Paris by the Germans during WWI was simply called ""The Paris Gun.""', u'Charles Chaplin and Jack Oakie enjoyed their roles so much, they often stayed in character after shooting finished for the day. They even attended a party, thrown by Mary Pickford, in full costume.', u'When Jack Oakie (Benzini Napaloni) first visits Adenoid Hynkel (Charles Chaplin) in his palace, Oakie greets Chaplin with a Yiddish expression, which, loosely translated, means ""How\'s it going?""', u""As originally written, Charles Chaplin's final speech, in which the barber is still masquerading as Hynkel, was a call for peace through appeasement. As news reports came in from Europe, however, he re-wrote it as a call for peace and liberty for all. Some critics, most notably columnist Ed Sullivan, claimed that the speech was pure Communist propaganda."", u""Initially, Hynkel's big speech was shot on location in the San Fernando Valley in front of an audience of extras. Despite the extreme heat, Charles Chaplin entertained the extras between shots with scenes from Sherlock Holmes and a variety of pratfalls. In the end, he could not use any of the footage. The scene required retakes, and Struss could not match the lighting from the location."", u""To keep the characters separate, Charles Chaplin shot most of his scenes as the barber first, then moved on to Hynkel's scenes."", u'Jack Oakie had been on a diet before filming started. To make him large enough to contrast effectively with Charles Chaplin, the director ordered his cook to fatten Oakie up.', u'Charles Chaplin (Adenoid Hynkel/The Jewish Barber) and Jack Oakie died only twenty-nine days apart. Chaplin died on December 25, 1977 and Oakie on January 23, 1978.', u'The part of the elderly Jewish shopkeeper, Mr. Jaeckel, is played in the film by Maurice Moscovitch, veteran of the Yiddish theater, but his wife, Mrs. Jaeckel, is played by the Emma Dunn, who often played Irish mothers and landladies.', u""Playwright Daniel Lewis James, who was associated via Erwin Piscator with Charles Chaplin's friend Hanns Eisler, helped Chaplin with the screenplay."", u""Hynkel's dance with the globe was originally written as a scene in which he cuts up a map of the world to rearrange the countries the way he wants.

Therefore, the song the Tramp sings is in gibberish, but it is possible to follow the story he tells by watching his hand gestures.', u'(at around 1h 25 mins) Discounting later parodies and novelty films, this was the last major American film to make use of silent film conventions, such as title cards for dialogue. The very last dialogue title card of this film (and thus, it can be said, the entire silent era) belongs to The Tramp, who says ""Buck up - never say die!

The dangerous large drop was actually a painted scene on a pane of glass carefully placed in front of the camera to align with the existing set and create the illusion of great height.', u'The Little Tramp\'s last words are ""Smile!

He even went as far as writing a dialogue script and experimenting with sound. However, because Chaplin intended the film to feature his Little Tramp character, sound seemed inappropriate. Consequently, the film was made using silent techniques, shot at 18 frames per second and then projected at 24 frames per second, which gave the slapstick sequences a more frenetic feel."", u'This was one of the films which, because of its political sentiments, convinced the House Un-American Activities Committee that Charles Chaplin was a Communist, a charge he adamantly denied.', u'According to Paulette Goddard, Charles Chaplin was deeply and profoundly involved in the recording of the musical score. He spent days upon days in the recording studio writing themes, and only left when Goddard begged him.', u'Another inspiration for the film was a conversation that Charles Chaplin had with Mohandas K. Gandhi, who complained about how machines were taking over. Chaplin told Gandhi, ""I grant that machinery with only the consideration of profit has thrown men out of work and created a great deal of misery, but to use it as a service to humanity ... should be a help and benefit to mankind."" But as they discussed it, Chaplin came to realize it was the first part of his statement-machinery that only considers profits has created a great deal of misery-that mattered most. Gandhi had convinced him without even trying.', u'A screening of the film closed out the 2003 Cannes Film Festival. A high point of the festival, an empty seat was illuminated by a spotlight to honor Charles Chaplin.', u""According to some accounts, working together on the film put a strain on Charles Chaplin and Paulette Goddard's relationship. Contrary to the way young actresses were presented on screen, Goddard was to wear shabby clothing and no make-up as the Gamin. When she showed up for filming with her hair beautifully coiffed, Chaplin dumped a bucket of water over her head."", u'The department store sequence originally had a scene where the Tramp lets one of the ex-factory workers clean out the goods from the silverware department of the store. However, Charles Chaplin later felt this made the petty larceny The Tramp abets too serious a crime, as opposed to stealing food to survive, and he removed it from the final edit.', u'The film is a comment on the increasing industrialization of modern living, something that Charles Chaplin felt exacerbated the grim employment and fiscal conditions of the Depression era.', u'The working title was ""The Masses.""', u'During filming, Paulette Goddard was still working for less than $100 a week as a chorus girl for the Goldwyn Studios.', u""The film shares many themes with Ren\xe9 Clair's \xc0 Nous la Libert\xe9 (1931).

According to a documentary on the DVD release, Chaplin went so far as to film a scene with full dialogue before deciding instead to make a partial talkie.', u'Shooting silent allowed Charles Chaplin the option of cranking the camera at any speed he wanted, sixteen, eighteen, or twenty-four frames per second. This allowed him a flexibility of rhythm and movement in any scene.', u'Although filmmaking had become the province of large teams of highly specialized technicians, Charles Chaplin resisted delegating tasks, involving himself in every aspect of production, even to the point of blowing bubbles in a pail of water to simulate stomach-grumbling sounds.', u'(at around 14 mins) The machine that Charles Chaplin goes through like a film projector was made of rubber and wood rather than steel, but it was still uncomfortable enough that Chaplin only wanted to do it once.

Only twenty-three years old at the time, Raksin was already a seasoned composer and arranger. After reviewing what Chaplin had composed, Raksin offered the opinion that it wasn\'t good enough for the film, nor was it modern enough or of sufficient ""symphonic dimension."" He was fired after one week, but rehired at Newman\'s urging and allowed to state his case. The rift was quickly patched and from that point, the two worked together well, having great fun coordinating musical ideas directly into the action running on a Moviola, instead of using timing sheets, the usual method of scoring. Raksin said that although Chaplin was not a professional musician, his command of musical styles, instrumental qualities, and development of melody and theme were impressive.', u'The food machine sequence took seven days to film.', u""Paulette Goddard's character's name is Ellen Peterson."", u'Publicity records indicate four hundred people were hired for the caf\xe9 scene, and photographs exist of Charles Chaplin himself, on a high tower, directing hundreds of other extras in the opening crowd shot, as opposed to the usual practice of assigning such a task to a second unit director.', u'By late spring 1935, Charles Chaplin was working sixteen to eighteen hours a day on Modern Times, often sleeping on a cot at the studio.', u'The factory boss was modelled on Henry Ford.

Nat \'King\' Cole recorded it and had a #10 hit on the Billboard charts that year. The lyrics (""Smile though your heart is aching/Smile even though it\'s breaking/When there are clouds in the sky/You\'ll get by"") were no doubt inspired by the final moments of the film when Charlie tells the Gamin, ""We\'ll get along,"" and enjoins her to smile. The song has been covered by such diverse performers as Michael Bolton, Eric Clapton, Lyle Lovett, Diana Ross, Tony Bennett, Jimmy Durante, and many others.', u'In 2007, the American Film Institute ranked this as the #78 Greatest Movie of All Time.', u'This was the first picture on which Charles Chaplin used a shooting script. This was so uncharacteristic for him that Variety even featured an article in September 1934, just before shooting began, about how the script and the construction of sets were evidence he was ""through with hit and miss sked."" The article noted that increased production costs and planned location shooting at the San Pedro docks necessitated a faster pace. Predictions that the movie would be completed by the end of 1934, however, proved to be inaccurate.', u""Alfred Newman, musical director for United Artists, was brought in to record and conduct the score. Charles Chaplin had been dissatisfied with the orchestral work on City Lights (1931), so this time he sat in on all recording sessions, interrupting often, ordering retakes, overruling Newman's instructions to the orchestra, and taking the recording sessions into the early morning hours. During one especially tense all-night session, he accused Newman of laziness. The conductor stomped out and never worked with Chaplin again. Newman's assistant, Eddie Powell, took over conducting for the remainder of the work."", u'The film was banned in Nazi Germany for ""communistic tendencies,"" although some said it was due to Charles Chaplin\'s resemblance to Adolf Hitler (exploited a few years later in The Great Dictator (1940)).

Chaplin, whose relationship with Cherrill was not friendly, fired her on the spot. He intended to reshoot the film with Georgia Hale, his heroine from The Gold Rush (1925), playing the flower girl; he even reshot the final scene between the tramp and the flower girl with Hale in the role. However, Chaplin had already spent far too much time and money on the project to start over. Knowing this, Cherrill offered to come back to work - at double her original salary. Chaplin reluctantly agreed and the film was completed. (Source: Virginia Cherrill interview, Unknown Chaplin (1983))', u'Virginia Cherrill was very near-sighted.

The millionaire plot was based on an old idea Chaplin had for a short, where two millionaires pick up the Little Tramp from the city dump and show him a good time in expensive clubs, and then drop him back off at the dump, so when he woke up the Tramp would not know if it was real or a dream. This was rewritten into a millionaire who is a friend of the Tramp when drunk, but does not recognize him when sober.', u""In 2008, this film was voted #1 on AFI's list over the ten best romantic comedies of all time."", u'Charles Chaplin\'s penchant for perfection carried over into all aspects of the production. He had a very clear vision as to how every scene should play. Robert Parrish, who had a small part as one of the newsboys who pelt The Tramp with peashooters, remembered in 1991: ""Chaplin was a dervish. He would blow a pea from the peashooter, playing both my part and the part of Austen Jewell, the other newsboy. He then would run over and react as the Tramp being hit by it, then back to the newsboys and blow another pea. He would then play Virginia Cherrill\'s part of the Blind Girl. Then he was the Tramp. Then he would instruct what the background people should be doing. Everyone watched as he acted out all the parts for us. When he felt he had it all worked out, he reluctantly gave us back our parts...I believe he would have much rather played them all himself if he could.""', u'The plot gradually grew from an initial concept Charles Chaplin had considered after the success of The Circus (1928), where a circus clown goes blind and has to conceal his handicap from his young daughter by pretending that his inability to see are pratfalls.', u""One of Charles Chaplin's most financially successful and critically acclaimed films despite being released well into the sound era."", u'The famous Flower Girl theme was written by Jos\xe9 Padilla.', u'The film was originally set in Paris.', u""One of Charles Chaplin's friends, the famous illustrator Ralph Barton, was on set one day during the filming of the scene where Charlie and the blind girl meet.

""I was 20. Charlie liked them younger.""', u'During the premiere, the theater manager, H.L. Gumbiner, was justifiably proud of the gorgeous new state-of-the-art Los Angeles Theatre. Unfortunately, he had terrible timing. To Charles Chaplin\'s horror, Gumbiner had the film stopped halfway through. ""Before continuing further with this wonderful comedy,"" boomed Gumbiner\'s voice over a loudspeaker to a bewildered audience, ""we would like to take five minutes of your time and point out to you the merits of this beautiful new theater.""Chaplin was livid. ""I could not believe my ears,"" he said. ""I went mad. I leaped from my seat and raced up the aisle: \'Where\'s that stupid son of a bitch of a manager? I\'ll kill him!\'"" The audience was on Chaplin\'s side. They began stomping their feet, calling out, and eventually booing the poorly timed intrusion. Finally getting the message, Gumbiner stopped and the film started back up.', u'Virginia Cherrill was cast on a whim when Charles Chaplin spotted her at a boxing match.', u'Production was delayed on several occasions. In 1929, one break lasted 62 days.', u'The opening reel and a dream vision of Charles Chaplin handsomely uniformed were deleted.', u""Charles Chaplin began shooting the film in 1928. Convinced that sound was just a passing fad, he decided to stick with his trademark pantomimic style. However, halfway through production he realized that the talkies weren't going away, so he shut down the film and tried to figure out how to incorporate sound. He was further hindered by the Wall Street Crash."", u'One of Charles Chaplin\'s most joyous times came during the film\'s famous boxing match scene. ""The filming of the boxing scene was the only social life we had at the studio,"" recalled Virginia Cherrill. ""Charlie must have had over a hundred extras present...and he encouraged his friends in town to come and watch. Everyone loved boxing in Hollywood in those days. And Charlie was so funny in the ring. The boxing scene became sort of a party at the studio. Charlie loved every minute of it.""', u'Everyone in this movie has been dead since 2007.', u'In 2007, the American Film Institute ranked this as the #11 Greatest Movie of All Time.', u'Since Charles Chaplin owned his own studio, he was able to control every aspect of the production. He could take his time and go at his own pace, spending as much time and money as he saw fit to get things done to his satisfaction. He demanded excellence from everyone working with him, but most of all he demanded it of himself.', u'Henry Clive was originally cast as the millionaire, but when he refused to fall into the water in a necessary scene, Charles Chaplin fired him and hired Harry Myers. Some sources say that Clive had a cold at the time and asked Chaplin if they could wait until the sun had warmed the water before getting in. Chaplin responded by promptly replacing him with a new actor.', u'While his demand for perfection could sometimes ruffle feathers, there was no question that Charles Chaplin poured his heart and soul into the pantomime art that he deeply loved. The film\'s poignant final shot was one that he was particularly proud of, having put a great deal of work into it despite its deceptive simplicity. He felt ""a beautiful sensation of not acting, of standing outside myself,"" he said. ""The key was exactly right - slightly embarrassed, delighted about meeting her again - apologetic without getting emotional about it. He was watching and wondering without any effort. It\'s one of the purest inserts - I call them inserts, close-ups - that I\'ve ever done.""', u'Charles Chaplin had interviewed several actresses to play the blind flower girl, but was unimpressed with them all. While seeing a film shoot with bathing women in a Santa Monica beach, he found a casual acquaintance, Virginia Cherrill. She waved and asked if she would ever get the chance to work with him. After a series of poor auditions from other actresses, Chaplin eventually invited her to do a screen test. She was the first actress to subtly and convincingly act blind on camera due to her near-sightedness', u'This marked the first time Charles Chaplin composed the film score to one of his productions.', u""Psychologist Stephen Weissman has hypothesized that the film is highly autobiographical, with the blind girl representing Charles Chaplin's mother, while the drunken millionaire represents Chaplin's father. Weissman also compared many of the film's sets with locations from Chaplin's real childhood, such as the statue in the opening scene resembling St. Mark's Church on Kennington Park Road and Chaplin referring to the waterfront set as the Thames Embankment."", u'Before it was released into theatres, Charles Chaplin had a secret sneak preview screening in downtown Los Angeles. Unfortunately, it was an experience that he described as ""ghastly"" because ""our film was thrown on to the screen to a half-empty house. The audience had come to see a drama and not a comedy, and they did not recover from their bewilderment until halfway through the picture. There were laughs, but feeble ones."" Some of the audience members even walked out in the middle of the film, according to Chaplin. ""I left the theater with a feeling of two years\' work and two million dollars having gone down the drain,"" he said in his autobiography.', u""Charles Chaplin spent $1,500,000 of his own money in making the film. A river was built at Chaplin's studio, which covered an area of five acres and cost $15,000 to construct. Two streets representing a downtown business section were also constructed at a cost of $100,000."", u'The film was given a 4K film transfer for theatrical distribution (Janus Films) and DVD/Blu-ray release (Criterion Collection) in 2013. The Criterion Collection home video release features an optional audio commentary track by Charles Chaplin biographer and archivist Jeffrey Vance.', u'Even though he had great confidence in the film, Charles Chaplin still couldn\'t help but worry that he would be seen as old-fashioned for making a silent picture. Now 40 years old, The Little Tramp, who had been one of the world\'s top box office stars for over a decade, could feel the public\'s interest in his career slowly waning, and it bothered him. ""In the past my work had usually stimulated interest among producers,"" he said in his 1964 autobiography. ""But now they were too preoccupied with the success of the talkies, and as time went on I began to feel outside of things; I guess I had been spoiled.""', u""A scene where The Tramp attempts to retrieve a stick that was stuck in a wall was filmed, but it was removed at Charles Chaplin's insistence."", u'To remind sound-oriented audiences of what to expect from the film, Chaplin billed the film as ""a comedy romance in pantomime written and directed by Charles Chaplin.""', u""According to his autobiography, Charles Chaplin was angered over United Artists' lack of pre-release publicity and decided to exhibit the picture himself.
