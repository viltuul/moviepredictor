In a town where nothing is as it seems... And everyone has something to hide.', u'In a town like Twin Peaks, no one is innocent.', u'These are the last seven days of Laura Palmer']","[u'According to writer Robert Engels, he and director David Lynch originally conceived this film as the first in a series of films exploring the mythology of the Black Lodge. To that effect, the two inserted four characters as ""outs"" with which to continue the story: Agent Dale Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan), Agent Phillip Jeffries (David Bowie), Major Garland Briggs (Don S. Davis) and Agent Chester Desmond (Chris Isaak). The critical and box-office failure of this film, however, caused Lynch to abandon any plans for sequels.', u'The numerous prominent actors in the film, including Kiefer Sutherland, David Bowie, Harry Dean Stanton and J\xfcrgen Prochnow, played small parts for almost no money because they had all been fans of Twin Peaks (1990) and/or David Lynch\'s other work. The same went for Chris Isaak but he had previously collaborated with Lynch when Lynch directed the music video for Isaak\'s song ""Wicked Game"" and popularized the song in his film Wild at Heart (1990).', u""Richard Beymer (Ben Horne) declined to participate due to a scene where Ben was to force Laura to kiss him in exchange for a bag of cocaine. Beymer felt that there had been no buildup for the character of Horne (who confesses his love for Laura in Twin Peaks (1990)) to extort Laura, and that as a result the scene came off as exploitative. As a result, another scene, in which Leland Palmer (Ray Wise) confronts Ben about Laura's photo being on Ben's desk, resulting in a fight with Ben's wife, was never shot. The scene also would have included Johnny and Jerry Horne."", u""Originally announced for production shortly after the cancellation of Twin Peaks (1990), the film was shelved when several key members of the cast - notably Lara Flynn Boyle, Sherilyn Fenn and Kyle MacLachlan - declined to participate. MacLachlan, in particular, adamantly refused to appear for fear of typecasting. Director David Lynch managed to persuade the actor to return albeit in an abbreviated role, and created the character of Agent Chester Desmond (Chris Isaak) to compensate for Cooper's absence in the story. This created several continuity errors (the degree of which is still debated among fans) between the film, the series and several canonical tie-in novels."", u'For one scene, David Lynch asked Sheryl Lee to inhale the smoke from five cigarettes at once. Lee agreed, and fainted on the spot.', u""In most versions of the film certain sequences are sub-titled - at the nightclub where the music drowns out the dialogue and when characters speak backwards - but not in the British version. Apparently, director David Lynch changed his mind so often as to whether they should be included or not, by the time he came to a final decision, the British distributors had already made all their prints (without subtitles) and couldn't afford to make any more."", u'Grace Zabriskie said on Sheryl Lee\'s performance in the film: ""She gave everything she had, she gave more than she could afford to give, and she spent years coming back"".', u""Contrary to rumors that she refused the chance to reprise her Twin Peaks (1990) role (which is taken over by Moira Kelly) because of the film's nude scenes, Lara Flynn Boyle's absence from Fire Walk With Me was actually due to scheduling conflicts, as she had prior obligations to four other films."", u'The song ""Sycamore Trees"" featured in Twin Peaks: Episode #2.22 (1991), but appearing on the movie soundtrack, is claimed by Norwegian pop group A-Ha to be an unauthorized cover of their song ""Sycamore Leaves"" written in 1989. A-Ha band member P\xe5l Waaktaar sued David Lynch (Lynch wrote the lyrics for Sycamore Trees) for plagiarizing, but eventually lost the case.', u""Robert Engels claims the script that he and David Lynch wrote is much longer than the version that Lynch actually filmed. He claims there is enough story for a sequel. Indeed, as with many other Lynch films, about five hours of footage was shot. Many of the scenes that ended up on the cutting room floor involved characters who appeared in Twin Peaks (1990) but not in the movie. These scenes include: Sheriff Harry Truman singing to Josie PackardJohnny Horne's birthday partyBobby Briggs' parents reading from the BibleDoc Hayward performing magic tricksa fight scene between FBI Agent Chester Desmond and Sheriff Cable."", u'Director Gregg Araki is a fan of Sheryl Lee\'s performance in Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me (1992), which he called ""one of the greatest performances in the history of cinema"". She later made an appearance in his film White Bird in a Blizzard (2014).', u'Much of the cast credited as starring in the film actually only make brief appearances on screen. Peggy Lipton and Heather Graham each appear for less than 30 seconds in the 134 minute film.', u""The zigzag pattern on the floor of the Black Lodge is similar to the pattern on the floor of the lobby of Henry's house in Eraserhead (1977), also directed by David Lynch. The Black Lodge version of the pattern is much larger."", u'The convenience store sequence refers back to one of the first episodes of Twin Peaks (1990), when Philip Gerard, under the influence of Mike, tells Cooper that the Black Lodge spirits lived above a convenience store when in the human world. According to Michael J. Anderson (Man From Another Place) the scene originally ran for twenty minutes; only about one minute actually appears in the film.', u""To honor Sheryl Lee's presence in North Bend for the 2011 Twin Peaks (1990) Festival and her performance in Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me, the Seattle Art Museum hosted a screening of David Lynch's personal 35mm print of the film. The screening was attended by Sheryl Lee, Ray Wise, Lenny von Dohlen, Phoebe Augustine and Jan D'Arcy."", u'The strange speech in the ""dream sequence"" was accomplished by the actor speaking the lines backwards. That audio then being played backwards creating an eerie dialect.', u'The film takes place from 1988 to 1989.', u'All the members of the Blue Rose team, other than Agent Cooper, are played by musicians: Chris Isaak, David Bowie, and Miguel Ferrer. Bowie and Ferrer have both worked with Bing Crosby. Bowie recorded a Christmas album with him, while Ferrer worked as a drummer when Crosby went on tour with his mother Rosemary Clooney.', u'Chris Isaak previously appeared in The Silence of the Lambs (1991), which also concerned an FBI investigation, although he only played a SWAT team member. Anthony Hopkins was cast as Hannibal Lecter because director Jonathan Demme wanted him to play the evil counterpart to his character in The Elephant Man (1980), directed by David Lynch.', u'Kiefer Sutherland and Ray Wise later appeared on 24 (2001). Another 24 co-star, James Morrison, appeared in the sequel series Twin Peaks (2017).', u""David Lynch: [Sunset Blvd.] Lynch's character Gordon Cole is named after an oft-mentioned character from Sunset Boulevard (1950)."", u'David Lynch: [singer] Julee Cruise, Chris Isaak, David Bowie.', u'David Lynch: [Clueless detectives]', u'David Lynch: [highway at night]', u'One pivotal scene deleted from the final film revealed the fate of Annie Blackburn (Heather Graham) after the ending of Twin Peaks: Episode #2.22 (1991). After escaping the Black Lodge, Anne was taken to the hospital where it was discovered that she was wearing the Owl Ring that belonged to Theresa Banks and Laura Palmer. A nurse then took the ring, and started laughing maniacally.', u""The movie originally ended showing Dale sitting in the Black Lodge, comforting Laura after she entered. It then cut to the last scene of the TV series - Twin Peaks: Episode #2.22 (1991) - with Harry breaking down the door of the bathroom and finding Dale smashing his head into the mirror and laughing. Dale tries to act like nothing happened, but is dragged off to bed. This was to confirm that it was Dale's doppelganger that escaped the Black Lodge."", u'Another deleted scene which took place after Laura\'s death extended the dialogue between Cooper and The Man From Another Place. Just after the dwarf says ""I am the arm,"" Cooper notices that the ring disappeared. He then informs Cooper that someone else has taken the ring, and implies that Cooper is trapped in the Lodge forever.', u""There's a very good reason why parts of the movie may seem nonsensical. According to writer Robert Engels, this film was meant to be only the first entry in the planned trilogy of sequel films that would have wrapped up the unfinished storyline from the Twin Peaks television series. Fire Walk With Me was the prequel, while the next film in line was suppose to be the first proper sequel and resolve the cliffhanger ending of the show as well as focus on the doppelgangers and the Black Lodge. Major Garland Briggs was suppose to go looking for the real Dale Cooper. More doppelgangers would have shown up in town. Agent Phillip Jeffries was suppose to explore the second portal to the Black Lodge that's located somewhere in Argentina and this would have led to the discovery of several more such portals located around the world. The enigmatic woman called Judy whom Jeffries mentions in the film was suppose to be Josie's sister.""]","[u'Japan::May 1992', u'France::16 May 1992 (Cannes Film Festival)', u'France::3 June 1992', u'Sweden::3 July 1992', u'Italy::29 July 1992 (Taormina Film Festival)', u'Germany::20 August 1992', u'USA::28 August 1992', u'Denmark::9 October 1992', u'Brazil::30 October 1992 (S\xe3o Paulo International Film Festival)', u'Finland::30 October 1992', u'Portugal::13 November 1992', u'UK::20 November 1992', u'Ireland::20 November 1992', u'Norway::26 November 1992', u'Argentina::3 December 1992', u'Netherlands::24 December 1992 (Amsterdam)', u'Italy::5 February 1993', u'Hungary::12 March 1993', u'Turkey::7 May 1993', u'Brazil::14 May 1993', u'Australia::9 December 1993', u'South Korea::25 March 1995', u'Spain::15 July 1998 (TV premiere)', u'Bulgaria::17 June 2005 (limited)', u'Greece::6 June 2006 (DVD premiere)', u'Spain::17 October 2006 (DVD premiere)', u'Spain::May 2009 (Madrid) (limited)', u'Spain::20 February 2014 (Phenomena Barcelona) (subtitled version)\n (premiere)', u'Spain::27 February 2014 (Phenomena Madrid) (subtitled version)\n (premiere)', u'Spain::2 October 2015 (Barcelona) (subtitled version)', u'Lithuania::23 March 2017 (Kino Pavasaris - Vilnius Film Festival)', u'France::31 May 2017 (re-release) (restored version)', u'Portugal::1 June 2017 (re-release) (restored version)', u'Switzerland::7 July 2017 (restored version) (Neuchatel International Fantastic Film Festival)', u'Israel::7 October 2017 (digitally restored version) (Haifa Film Festival)']"

The child was entranced, hence the hypnotic stare, and the perfect silence."", u'Various music superstars were in the running to play Jareth. Michael Jackson was strongly considered. Prince and Mick Jagger were thought about too. Jim Henson preferred Sting, until his kids convinced him that David Bowie (who had reached his peak of mainstream popularity in 1983 with the ""Let\'s Dance"" album) would be best suited to it. Bowie was keen to make a children\'s movie, he liked the concept and found the script amusing and of more interest to him than many other contemporary special effects movies.', u'Over a hundred pairs of latex hands were made for the ""Helping Hands"" scene.', u'Final feature film directed by Jim Henson.', u'David Bowie did the voice (gurgling) for the baby in the song ""Magic Dance"".', u""To help the puppeteer inside him to see, there was a miniature video camera in Ludo's right horn that fed to a small television monitor mounted inside the puppet's stomach."", u'The baby who plays Toby is Toby Froud, son of Brian Froud who was the conceptual designer for both this movie and The Dark Crystal (1982), another Jim Henson production.', u""There are pictures of David Bowie on Sarah's mirror along side of a model figure of King Jareth on the vanity in Sarah's room."", u'Sarah\'s dog ""Merlin"" is also used for Sir Didymus\' mount ""Ambrosius"". In Geoffrey of Monmouth\'s The History of the Kings of Britain, Merlin is called ""Merlin Ambrosius"".', u'Two official music videos by David Bowie promoting this title and directed by Steve Barron were released. ""As the World Falls Down"" features scenes from the film itself, not just the ballroom scene, and includes specially filmed scenes of Hoggle together with Bowie. ""Underground"", which can be heard as the final credits roll, features many of the films characters again in specially filmed scenes with Bowie.', u'After solving the problem of the guards who lie or tell the truth, Sarah falls into an oubliette, which Hoggle describes: ""It\'s a place where you put people...to forget about \'em!"" Oubliettes were a type of dungeon where the only entry was through an opening high in the ceiling. To leave an oubliette was practically impossible without external assistance. The word ""oubliette"" comes from the French word ""oublier\' meaning \'to forget"". The basic premise was that an oubliette was a dungeon for prisoners that the captor(s) wished to forget. Prisoners were often left to starve to death in an oubliette.', u'When he learned that the Ludo rig being made weighed over 100 pounds, Jim Henson told the Creature Shop to start all over again and make it lighter. It was brought down to just over 75 pounds, but was still too heavy for one person to operate all the time. Therefore the performance was split between puppeteers Ron Mueck & Rob Mills.', u""Hoggle consisted of 1 actor inside the suit: actress Shari Weiser, along with 4 puppeteers led by Brian Henson controlling 18 motors inside the face rig. Manipulating a mechanical mitt on his right hand, Henson controlled Hoggle's jaw movements and provided the voice. Another puppeteer provided further lip movements with another mitt. The third member of the team used a fingertip joystick lever to control Hoggle's eyes and eyelids. The fourth used a similar mechanism to animate the eyebrows and a foot pedal to control the skin around Hoggle's eyes. The puppeteers had to rehearse together for weeks in order to anticipate each other's movements."", u'One of the choreographers for the film is Cheryl McFadden. She also appears, uncredited, as one of the masked dancers in the ballroom scene. A year after this film, she starred on ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"", credited as Gates McFadden, playing Dr. Beverly Crusher, a role she played in six of the seven seasons of the series and four feature films.', u'In the DVD version, there are hidden faces in seven scenes. In general, they resemble the head that Jareth leans against before giving Hoggle the peach (David Bowie\'s actual face at that time). The faces can be found: Upper right corner of the [stone] maze, just after the worm shakes its head and says ""If she\'d have kept on going down that way..."" To the right of the screen, after the rung under Hoggle breaks, as he watches it fall. Upper left corner of the hedge maze, as Hoggle is muttering ""Get through the labyrinth, get through the labyrinth, one thing\'s for sure... "" Lower right corner of the wall bordering the Bog of Eternal Stench, just after the ledge breaks under Sarah and Hoggle for the first time. During the wide shot of the hedge maze in the middle left on the stony floor just after the hat says, ""It\'s so stimulating being your hat."" In the forest as Sir Didymus says ""We should reach the castle well before day.""', u""The split sculpture was an invention of Jim Henson and Debbie the Roboteer for Labyrinth. It looks simply like a series of rocks until the camera pans to the correct angle, then it resembles Jareth's face. Developed over several grueling evenings with hot, noisy robots and Plastina Romana at the Robotorium, Inc on Mott Street in NYC during the early-1980s."", u'Monty Python member Terry Jones wrote one early version of the script. Little of his material was retained beyond the point where Sarah eats the poisoned peach. The original script ended with Sarah punching and kicking Jareth, then watching him shrink down until he\'s becomes a small and ""snivelling"" goblin. Also, Toby\'s name was Freddie in the early drafts of the story. The baby\'s name was changed because the infant Toby Froud would only react to his own name.', u'The upside-down room in the Goblin City is directly inspired by a drawing by M.C. Escher (entitled ""Relativity"") - which can been seen in Sarah\'s room at the beginning of the film.', u'In one version of the script, the junk lady was actually a puppet being manipulated by Jareth, and the junkyard was actually a town complete with a bar that Hoggle visits before they find Sarah.', u'An ongoing joke is Hoggle\'s name being mispronounced. In an early instance, ""Sarah"" calls him \'Hogwart\'. \'Hogwart\' originally comes from the famous British humor book, \'The Compleet Molesworth\', by Geoffrey Willans and Ronals Searle.', u'During the ""Escher room"" scene there is a sequence when Jareth\'s crystal ball seems to bounce up the stairs and into Toby\'s hand. This was accomplished by having Toby drop the ball down the stairs, and then reversing the shot.', u'The movie is loosely based on Outside Over There, a children\'s picture book written and illustrated by Maurice Sendak in 1981. The story follows young Ida who must enter the fantastical world described as ""outside over there"" to find her baby sister, who\'s been spirited away by some goblins.', u'Sarah makes the mistake by picking the direction of going ""right."" When she first enters the labyrinth she turns right. Then the worm tells her to go ""right"" when she passes through the wall. She later goes through the ""right"" door with the Blue Shield Goblins and falls down through shaft of ""helping"" hands. ""Right"" again when she chooses the door with the knocker with ring in mouth (door with forest of the Firese.)', u'Producer George Lucas chose not to do any interviews during the release of this film as to ""Not steal Jim Henson\'s thunder"", who was at the time one of his best friends until his death.', u'According to the Goblin Companion (a book that gives a description of every goblin in the Labyrinth - written by Brian Froud and Terry Jones) the Junk Lady who carries everything on her back is named Agnas.', u'Helena Bonham Carter, Jane Krakowski, Yasmine Bleeth, Sarah Jessica Parker, Mary Stuart Masterson, Laura Dern, Maddie Corman, Kerri Green, Lili Taylor, Laura San Giacomo, Ally Sheedy, Mia Sara, and Marisa Tomei all auditioned for the role of Sarah Williams. Krakowski, Sheedy, and Corman were all highly considered for the role, alongside Jennifer Connelly, who eventually won the role.', u'In the beginning of the iconic ""Magic Dance"" scene, Toby is seen crying while surrounded by numerous goblins. In reality, the baby actor Toby Froud wasn\'t the least bit scared by any of the puppets and animatronics used. They had to wait until he was tired and wanted to nap after filming the musical number.', u'Just after the Junk Lady places ""dear old Flopsy"" behind Sarah she slips a book titled \'The Wizard Of Oz\' behind Flopsy.', u""In 1986, two video games based on the movie were released, one in Japan and one in the US and other markets. Labyrinth: The Computer Game for Apple II and Commodore 64 was released in the west. It was the first graphic adventure game developed by Lucasfilm Games, a company that became LucasArts in the 1990. In the game, the player has 13 real-time in-game hours to solve the dangerous labyrinth and thwart Jareth's plan. In Japan, Nintendo and Henson Associates, Inc. released a different game simply called Labyrinth for the Famicom system. The game was almost entirely in Japanese, since it was made exclusively for the Japanese market and it never got an official western release, although popular English unofficial fan translations do exist. The game is an action adventure role playing game, not unlike Zelda, and it also has a real-time in-game ticking clock like its western counterpart."", u""The original script had Sarah accidentally entering the Goblin dimension by grabbing Jareth's mantle as he flees. After she enters the Labyrinth she tracks down Jareth who eventually offers her a deal. In the final script the 13-hour deal comes right after Jareth invades Sarah's home. Earlier drafts also depicted Jareth explicitly as an ideal man that Sarah subconsciously conjures from some pictures of a charming man in the newspaper. This would lead more fluently to the blur ball room scene where the Goblin King tempts Sarah with everything she always wanted. The original meeting in the house was also more elaborate with Jareth giving a creepy performance with an ugly doll which ultimately turned into a goblin. This was simplified for the film with Jareth coming after the unwitting wish."", u""The 13 hour margin has a symbolic meaning and was not an arbitrary number chosen randomly. Sarah made her wish around midnight. This is the most powerful time when demons, goblins and other malevolent creatures can cross their dimension and enter the earthly realm. Moreover, according to folklore there is a time rift between midnight and one o' clock a.m. which is the nominal 13th hour. In order for this time circumvention to be activated, something jarring and horrible must happen just like Sarah's wish. In the film this element is altered with the 13th hour lasting for 13 hours and not just 60 minutes. This is why the magical clock has 13 numbers on it. Although it is never spelled out directly in the film, the individuals who enter the earthly dimension from the outer planes (or vice versa) manage to enter the time fissure. Although time flies in the 13th hour it does not advance in the human world. The novelization confirms that when Sarah's parents return home, little time has gone by in the house as it is past midnight. Although Sarah spends hours in the Goblin dimension, it is inferred that less than an hour has elapsed in the human world."", u""A sequence that didn't make it to the film had Sarah discovering paintings which depicted other sites of the Labyrinth. The paintings were lifelike and as Jareth and Toby moved through the maze , their images would relocate accordingly."", u'According to the novelization Hoggle is a gnome. The junk lady however is revealed to be a female goblin.', u""When Sarah, Hoggle, Sir Dydimus, and Ludo enter the goblin city, several roaming animals can be seen. One of which is a crawly. A furry shellfish eaten by Skeksis during the feast in Jim Henson's The Dark Crystal."", u'The talking hat had a much larger role. There was an excised scene in a bar where the hat babbled incessantly to the patrons. In the film the hat appears briefly .', u'The music box was a gift to Sarah by her mother on her recent birthday. Although this detail is never mentioned in the film, the junk lady taps on the emotional attachment of Sarah to the box when she says that this item cannot possibly be junk.', u""Hoggle is voiced by Brian Henson, Jim Henson's son."", u""Throughout the movie there is a black crow. When Sarah crosses the bog, it's perched watching her. It's also in the junkyard. Again when her group of friends and her enter the Goblin city."", u'This was the first time Jim Henson had worked with a baby in one of his works.', u'David Bowie has the same hair cut that Limahl the performer of Never-ending story song. Another fantasy film with puppets and that told a story of lost of innocence.', u'Novelisation by A. C. H. Smith.', u'Every time anybody says its a piece of cake in this movie something bad happens shortly after.', u'The novelization clarifies that every individual inside the Labyrinth is an island. Jareth has prohibited every emotional relationship among them and therefore every creature must survive on its own. For every transaction there must always be a price. This is why every passage has a test or a riddle. It also explains why there is an exchange for every bit of information that Hoggle or the Wise Man offer.', u'In the novelization the scene with the talking door knocks was extended. Sarah would try both doors and not just knock on the mumbling head. She would tentatively open the door with the deaf head and it would lead to an extremely sunny and cheerful forest. Despite the warnings by a wary Ludo she would enter the enchanted forest. Then she would find out that every living creature inside it would laugh incessantly including the flowers. Essentially this was just another trap by Jareth. It was only by much coercion by Ludo (who stayed wisely by the door) that Sarah managed to escape from the eternally happy forest and her entranced state. After she comes back she eventually knocks on the second door. For pacing reasons the scene in the film was cut short and Sarah enters the gloomy forest right away. However this is proven to be the right choice since it ultimately leads to the castle. This is consistent with the recurring theme of the Labyrinth that many things are not what they seem.', u'It appears that the worm has double crossed Sarah since it sends her on the wrong track. However this may not necessarily be the case. By going through the entire Labyrinth, Sarah met her friends. It was only with much assistance from Ludo, Hoggle and Sir Didymus (the latter actually had a more active role in the novelization by fending off many goblins) that Sarah managed to survive the robot guard and the massive attack in Goblin City. If she went straight into the castle she would be most likely injured and chased away by the goblin army. So the wrong choice may ultimately be the right one (which is a common underlying theme in the Labyrinth).', u""The last scene was altered during production. Sarah's communication with Ludo, Hoggle and Sir Didymus would take place via her bedroom window and not her vanity mirror. After sharing their goodbyes with Sarah, her friends would simply fade away. In the film this scene is modified to a more upbeat resolution."", u'Although the junk lady is another creature of the Labyrinth hired by the Goblin King to distract Sarah from her mission, it was originally intended to be a mechanical puppet operated by Jareth.', u'The climactic siege where the army of guards tries to invade the goblin house inside which the leads have taken refuge was extended. The goblins would repeatedly deride Hoggle for his betrayal and he would retort that he has found friends, a concept that was inconceivable for the creatures of the Labyrinth.', u""Before his passing, Labrynth actor, David Bowie owned the cinema distribution rights to the left shoulder of the Hulk (Marvel) Jennifer Connelly starred in 'Hulk' with Eric Bana. Another coincidence, the same poodle was used in that version of Hulk and to bolster David Bowie's codpiece in Labrynth."", u'While the novelization describes Hoggle as a Gnome, Jareth describes Hoggle as a Dwarf just after Sarah falls into the Oubliette. Jareth states, ""The Dwarf will lead her back to the beginning. She\'ll give up once she realizes she has to start all over"". It can be assumed, as Hoggle is the only one in the Oubliette with Sarah, and he specifically states to Jareth shortly thereafter, ""I was taking her back to the beginning"", that Jareth was referring to Hoggle as the Dwarf.     It is also possible, given the age of the movie, Jareth was simply referring to Hoggle\'s height versus his race. Hoggle does not have the traditional features of a fantasy Dwarf. He does however have commonly accepted features of Gnomes, such being even smaller in stature to the commonly accepted Dwarf height and a round nose.', u'The name of the giant robot that guards the gates of Goblin City is Humongous.']","[u'USA::27 June 1986', u'Argentina::10 July 1986', u'Japan::26 July 1986', u'Hong Kong::4 September 1986', u'UK::1 December 1986 (London)\n (premiere)', u'UK::2 December 1986', u'France::3 December 1986', u'Australia::4 December 1986', u'West Germany::11 December 1986', u'Netherlands::18 December 1986', u'Portugal::18 December 1986', u'Spain::19 December 1986', u'Finland::19 December 1986', u'Ireland::19 December 1986', u'Iceland::19 December 1986', u'Sweden::19 December 1986', u'Italy::23 December 1986', u'Brazil::25 December 1986', u'Colombia::25 December 1986', u'Denmark::13 February 1987', u'Hungary::7 July 1988', u'Greece::4 April 2005 (DVD premiere)', u'Czech Republic::1 December 2005 (British Film Days)', u'Argentina::9 November 2009 (Mar del Plata Film Festival)', u'Canada::7 February 2010 (Digital Film Festival)', u'Canada::22 August 2010 (Nova Scotia) (re-release)', u'Spain::29 June 2012 (Barcelona) (re-release)', u'Poland::21 July 2012 (New Horizons Film Festival)', u'Spain::4 October 2012 (re-release) (limited)', u'Spain::17 January 2013 (re-release) (limited)', u'Spain::4 January 2015 (Barcelona) (re-release)', u'Netherlands::18 October 2016 (Cinekid Film Festival)', u'Poland::22 October 2016 (International Film Festival TOFIFEST)', u'Argentina::28 April 2017 (Buenos Aires International Festival of Independent Cinema)']"

The sun, already half-set on the horizon, is a long way away; the flight did not reach anywhere near it. This, of course, is another metaphor for Newton's predicament, as Icarus falls into water too.
