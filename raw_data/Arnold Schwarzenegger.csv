He also considered it the beginning of the end of his film career.', u'One major reason for the film\'s box-office failure was the unforgiving process needed to have it ready for the studio-mandated June 18, 1993 release date, which left almost no time for follow-up editing, or fine-tuning after a disastrous May 1st sneak preview. There were discussions about moving the release into July or August 1993, especially when Universal deliberately chose to open Jurassic Park (1993) on June 11th, but it was decided that doing so would turn off potential moviegoers. When the film was released and received widespread criticism, an anonymous movie worker said ""We shouldn\'t have had Siskel & Ebert telling us the movie is ten minutes too long"".', u'Arnold Schwarzenegger wanted the film to be PG-13, so it would appeal to a broader audience.

However, the f-word does actually appear in the movie, spoken by Lieutenant Dekker during one of his rapid-fire rants at Slater. Due to the nature of the scene it is hard to discern, but it is definitely there.', u'The film contains several intentional continuity errors.', u""John McTiernan said the film began as a wonderful Cinderella story, with a nine year old boy and a pretty good script. But the film didn't end as it began, referring to the film's troubled production and the fact that it opened in theaters a week after Jurassic Park (1993). After the film's failure, McTiernan retreated to his house in Wyoming, and took a break from his career."", u'The original screenplay was developed by Adam Leff and Zak Penn with Arnold Schwarzenegger in mind for the lead, and was titled ""Extremely Violent"". After Columbia purchased the script, the studio independently approached Arnold about the film. The star\'s decision came down to either the now-titled ""Last Action Hero"" or a Penny Marshall-directed Columbia comedy called ""Sweet Tooth"", with LAH winning out. The script was later re-written by Shane Black and David Arnott to rev up the action sequences, and William Goldman did a one million dollar polish when Arnold made it clear he would not begin filming until Goldman added depth for the film\'s characters.', u'Jack Slater, when trying to pose as Arnold Schwarzenegger in the real world, keeps getting the name wrong, and calling himself ""Arnold Braunschweiger."" The first part of Arnold\'s real name, ""Schwarz,"" means ""black"" in German, while the first part of his wrong name, ""Braun,"" means ""brown"" in German. Also, a ""Braunschweiger"" is a type of liverwurst made in Braunschweig (or Brunswick), Germany. In the German dub, he calls himself ""Arnold Beckenbauer"" (""Pool-Builder""), which creates additional comedy, since it is also the name of one of Germany\'s most famous soccer players.', u'During the shooting of the movie, Arnold Schwarzenegger gave an interview on the set to Dagmar Koller, a famous Austrian musical-star, for an Austrian television show. After the interview, Schwarzenegger invited her to appear in the movie. She can be seen in the police headquarters as Danny talks to her.', u'The police station is the lobby of an administration building on the Sony Pictures lot. It was also used as the lobby of the television station in The Running Man (1987), which also starred Arnold Schwarzenegger', u'Body Count: eighty-three.', u'After Benedict murders the car mechanic and wants to confess, someone in the background is carrying a pair of recently stolen shoes.', u'The film ran behind schedule, so much so that there was just one test screening that ran for two hours and twenty minutes with a lot of inaudible dialogue, boring the audience. The studio refused to delay the opening, so as not to send the message the film was in trouble, a decision Arnold Schwarzenegger agreed with.', u""Before the Hamlet sequence, wherein the Laurence Olivier version Hamlet (1948) is played on a projector, the teacher who introduces the film is Joan Plowright, Olivier's third wife and widow. Noting her students' apparent ignorance of Olivier's storied career, she tells them they may remember him as Zeus in Clash of the Titans (1981), one of Olivier's final roles."", u'Some trailers show a few deleted and alternate scenes, such as an extended Hamlet action scene where Arnold Schwarzenegger is in some water shooting at someone, Danny being blown away into the movie after dynamite pops out of screen, and an alternate take and angle for Slater\'s ""I hate when that happens"" line after he gets out of the tar pit. A couple other deleted scenes are from the original 140 minutes long rough cut include dialogue scene between Danny and Jack in which Danny says how his father died from cancer and a scene where a group of kids see Jack while he is walking across the street in the rain with Danny looking for Benedict and they think he is Schwarzenegger, so they ask him for his autograph which he signs.', u""In 1993, after attending the world premiere, Robin Quivers from the Howard Stern Show said it was the best movie she'd ever seen."", u""The filming involved a 3:00 pm to 3:00 am, 7-day, shutdown of six-block Times Square area in New York City for the production. Originally, a giant 75-foot balloon of Arnold Schwarzenegger held three few sticks of dynamite in the balloon's hand but, following the then-recent 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center, Richard Brick, Commissioner of the New York City Mayor's Office of Film, Theatre and Broadcasting and Gary Martin, President of Production at Columbia Pictures agreed to change the prop to a badge."", u'When Danny and Jack are looking in the video store for the action section to find a ""Schwarzenegger"" film. Danny is surprised and confused to see that Terminator 2 (1991)\'s poster features Sylvester Stallone and that apparently Schwarzenegger films do not exist. However, as Jack walks towards Danny to compliment Stallone\'s work, on the shelf alongside a number of other known Hollywood films of the time, a VHS tape of one of Arnold Schwarzenegger\'s earlier films Raw Deal (1986) is clearly visible, with Arnold featuring prominently on the cover.', u'Due to delays with the film Hook (1991), this was the first movie released in SDDS (Sony Dynamic Digital Sound). With five front channels and two rears, it was also the first film to include a 7.1 channel SDDS mix, rather than the more common 5.1 SDDS.', u""While Danny is in the movie, he says John Practice (F.

Most noted for its interchangeable barrels on the same frame, from two inches to ten inches. Slater carries a Desert Eagle .50 caliber Action Express."", u'The fact that Jack Slater was out to avenge the death of his second cousin Frank in ""Jack Slater IV"" was an intentionally ridiculous element. The idea was that having gone through so many epic, personal conflicts with super-villains during the first three films, Jack Slater was left to battle the mob due to the death of a very minor character. This would also allow the Danny Madigan character to start listing the flaws of the Jack Slater films, as well as how they were running out of good ideas.', u'The first time Arnold Schwarzenegger took a producing credit on a film.', u'In the film, the characters are able to enter and leave the movie world via a magic ticket which is credited to famous stage illusionist and escapologist Harry Houdini. However, in real-life, Houdini was firmly opposed to the idea of supernatural powers, and spent his time debunking fake spiritualists and phony mediums.', u'The name of the boss gangster, Tony Vivaldi, is a spoof of the famous classical composer Antonio Vivaldi. Jokes about classical music are a recurring theme in this movie.', u'In one scene, Jack says to Danny, regarding his ex-wife, ""Do you think I would marry someone so stupid that doesn\'t know the real voice from a taped one?"" In Arnold Schwarzenegger\'s next film, True Lies (1994), he uses a taped voice to fool his wife.', u""Sir Ian McKellen plays Death, a character out of Ingmar Bergman's film The Seventh Seal (1957). In that film, Death was played by Swedish actor Bengt Ekerot."", u'Tori Spelling had a cameo as herself but it was eventually left on the cutting room floor.', u'The film makes several oblique references to the Governor of Los Angeles. These are eerily prescient statements to make with Arnold Schwarzenegger later becoming the Governor of California.', u'Charles Dance replaced Timothy Dalton as Benedict. Had this not happened, this would have been the second of two movies with Dalton and Frank McRae, even though they would not have had any screentime together. The first was Licence to Kill (1989).', u'Tony Curtis was cast in a major cameo but was replaced.', u'Jean-Claude Van Damme features in the premiere scene. He would later star opposite Arnold Schwarzenegger in The Expendables 2 (2012).', u""Danny's New York City apartment is unit number 3D, an indication that he lives in the real world, as opposed to the 2-D world of Jack's movies."", u'Final on-screen appearance of Professor Toru Tanaka.', u'In Blockbuster, there is a cardboard cutout for Terminator 2 (1991). The actor shown instead of Arnold Schwarzenegger is Sylvester Stallone.', u'Little Richard has a cameo as himself in this film.

Whitney: Colt Python .357 Magnum; S.W.A.T. member: Colt Commando.', u'Producer Mark Canton optioned the script for three hundred fifty thousand dollars.', u'This was the first film to use the 1993 Columbia Pictures logo.', u'The real City Coat of Arms for Los Angeles has the American federal shield (a white field with six red thin vertical stripes on the field - creating the illusion of seven white, and six red stripes, for a total of thirteen stripes, and thirteen white stars in the blue Chief) in the first quarter (upper left quadrant of the field); the California state flag (A five-point star in the upper right corner of the field, a grizzly bear, and a horizontal stripe in the base; all in red) in the second quarter (upper right quadrant of the field); the Mexican eagle atop a green cactus (from the Mexican flag) in the third quarter (lower left quadrant), and the parted arms of alliance for Castile and Leon (representing Spain) in the fourth quarter (lower right quadrant of the field). When Jack Slater pulls into the parking lot at Police Headquarters (actually a Sony Pictures office building), the Los Angeles Coat of Arms out front, has the American eagle (with a federal shield with four stars in the Chief in escutcheon) instead of the Mexican eagle in the third quarter, and a black rhinoceros (instead of the red Bear) in the California state flag in the second quarter.', u'When Jack Slater punches the Lieutenant Governor and says: ""When the Governor gets here, call me."" Arnold Schwarzenegger went on to be the Governor of California.', u""(At around thirty-nine minutes) In the video store, Jack Slater's hand is resting almost right next to a DVD case for The Road Warrior (1981), which was the inspiration for The Terminator (1984), with Arnold Schwarzenegger in the title role. This is also during the conversation with Danny Madigan about how it was supposed to be Arnold in Terminator 2 (1991), but instead had Sylvester Stallone."", u'John McTiernan and Composer Michael Kamen also collaborated on Die Hard (1988) and Die Hard with a Vengeance (1995).', u'The Region 2 PAL United Kingdom DVD includes German, Italian, French, and Spanish audio tracks as well as the original English.

These films were Revenge (1990) and China Moon (1994) respectively.', u'Arnold Schwarzenegger\'s name is mentioned in the song ""Jump Around"" by House of Pain in Mrs. Doubtfire (1993). Robert Prosky was also in that film, plus Cinematographer Donald McAlpine had filmed Predator (1987), also directed by John McTiernan, and which also starred Schwarzenegger. They reunited with this film.', u'There are similarities to Die Hard (1988), like Jack Slater falling from the building and elevator, like Hans Gruber in Die Hard (1988), which was also directed by John McTiernan.

The guy\'s hanging there by his neck and at the end of the movie he comes back"", after the car crash scene in New York involving Benedict and the Tough Asian Man, Danny referenced Die Hard (1988) previously directed by John McTiernan. In addition, Professor Toru Tanaka\'s bad guy in this film was killed by Arnold Schwarzenegger\'s good guy, just like in The Running Man (1987). Tanaka yet again came to a sticky end with Schwarzenegger.', u'When Jack kills The Ripper, The Ripper says, ""I\'ll be back!"", to which Jack replies, ""the hell you will!""

Azar won the role following an open casting call looking for a person who can match the closest to Schwarzenegger\'s physique in the first film. Azar never thought of the idea of being in this film until he was persuaded by his manager Mike Lyons to audition. According to Azar, aside from being judged having the closest physique (the first round of auditions involves body and muscle measurement), it was his audition video of him reenacting the Terminator\'s arrival at the Griffith Observatory and his perfect lip-syncing of Schwarzenegger\'s line, ""Your clothes, give them to me. Now."" at the three punks resulted in him winning the role. His face was replaced with Schwarzenegger in post-production.

Her search online and other various avenues mostly had second-hand and worn Vandals for sale. For months, she approached Nike with the request of manufacturing that specific model of shoes but Nike wanted her to design an ID with an Air-Force base. Matheson refused because being a person with knowledge of sneakers, she did not want to feel guilty of cheating the audience, especially eagle-eye fans of the first film who can spot the difference between those two bases. It was only after intervention by Paramount that Nike agreed to shutdown production and manufactured 25 pairs of Vandals solely for this film, in what is called as Matheson's greatest personal moment in this film."", u""This is Paramount studio's first film in The Terminator series.

The scene was written as a nod to a scene that was cut from Terminator 2 (1991), where John teaches The Terminator to smile so that he can be more human and blend in; the Terminator imitates a man talking on a phone, but the smile is imperfect and crooked and John insists that The Terminator should try practicing in a mirror.

However, they are not related to Harlan Ellison whose name is credited in The Terminator (1984)."", u""In The Terminator (1984), it was established that Terminators do not just wear living human tissue to blend in. They wear the living human tissue, so they can go through the Time Displacement Field. Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) surmised that living tissue generates a field necessary for time traveling, as 'nothing dead will go'. In this film, it is added that if a Terminator would go through without living human tissue, or if the metal underneath is exposed, it would quickly heat up the metal akin to a microwave, and blow up along with the Time Displacement Field. With the living human tissue, The Time Displacement Field cannot penetrate the Terminator's endoskeleton."", u""Screenwriter Laeta Kalogridis said that the main inspiration of the film was the second-half of Back to the Future Part II (1989) where Marty McFly (Michael J.

Boen played Dr. Peter Silberman in The Terminator (1984), Terminator 2 (1991) and Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003).

Due to his brain, which is a neural processor (a learning computer), he could actually become more human and go along without getting discovered.', u'There are a few subtle hints at the beginning of the film that indicate that the prologue already takes place in a different timeline (i.e. it is not the exact same future as seen in The Terminator (1984)): Kyle Reese is saved by John Connor from a Terminator in a sewer, whereas in The Terminator, he states that John freed him from a factory where he was enslaved by Skynet. Also, Kyle still has the photograph of Sarah Connor before he is about to time travel.

In T2, Sarah received the cut in the elevator while escaping the T-1000 from the mental ward. This may insinuate that some things in history are unavoidable.', u""Whether by coincidence or by design, two of James Cameron's unused ideas for his Terminator movies ended up being used in this film. For The Terminator (1984), Cameron originally wanted Skynet to send two Terminators back to 1984: one being a cyborg, and the other a liquid, shape-shifting android. However, due to the limitations in special effects, the idea for the shape-shifter was not used until Terminator 2 (1991). For T2, Cameron briefly considered the idea of two T-800s in Arnold Schwarzenegger's likeness battling each other, one being the 'good' Terminator, the other one evil; this was eventually changed to one T-800 and a T-1000. In Terminator Genisys, both a cyborg (the T-800) and a liquid android (T-1000) are sent back to the altered timeline of 1984, and there are two T-800s in Arnold's likeness battling each other (even though the evil one is technically not played by Arnold but a body double)."", u'The scene where Sarah and Kyle arrive in 2017 barenaked in the middle of a freeway was a nod to Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles (2008) Pilot (#1.1), where Sarah, John, and Cameron arrive in 2007 in the middle of a freeway barenaked.', u'Throughout the film, John Connor bears scars on the left side of his face. This is synonymous with the portrayal of future John Connor in all the Terminator films, even though the ways and times he received the scars were probably different since the films take place in different timelines. Similarly, the shoulder wounds that Sarah Connor receives in Terminator 2 (1991) are replicated in this movie.', u""The early sequence in the film with John Connor and Kyle Reese finding the time displacement facility is nearly beat-for-beat identical to the same sequence in the novelization of Terminator 2 (1991). The book was written by Randall Frakes based on James Cameron's original T2 script, but the sequence wasn't filmed due to the cost of the sets needed."", u'Arnold Schwarzenegger explained there are actually two versions of the same T-800 in Terminator Genisys, a younger version and an older version that has been reprogrammed.', u'The film takes place on August 29, 1997, in the 2010s, in 2029, on May 12, 1984, in October 2017 and in 1973.', u""There was speculation that Matt Smith's character is Tim (played in Terminator 2 (1991) by Danny Cooksey), John Connor's friend who got pushed aside by the T-1000 when it tracks Connor down at the arcade. Matt Smith's character is really a physical manifestation of Skynet."", u""James Cameron, creator of the Terminator film series, loved this film and stated that this was respectful to The Terminator (1984) and Terminator 2 (1991) and saw this as the real third Terminator film. He praised the new Emilia Clarke incarnation of Sarah Connor and liked the twist about John Connor being the film's main antagonist."", u'The after credits scene proves that Skynet knew what was going to happen the entire time.', u'It is implied that Skynet was actually an operating system, based on software which was tested, and modified with artificial intelligence algorithms, and that the Skynet program was kept in a circular holographic storage unit. In any case, that means the servers the antagonist blew up contain a copy of Skynet programming and the actual data file was locked and secured away. This is shown at the end of the movie.', u'In the first three Terminator movies, the death of the villainous Terminator was greeted with the word ""Terminated"". The previous film, Terminator Salvation (2009) did not have the line spoken aloud, but the word was shown on the T-800\'s internal display after it killed Marcus Wright, an endoskeleton-enhanced human. In this movie, when Sarah asks if the John Connor Terminator/T-3000 is destroyed, perhaps as an in-joke, the T-800 gives an elaborate description of \'terminated\', but avoids the word itself.', u'Bill Paxton was unable to reprise his role as one of the three ""street thugs"" at the Griffith Observatory.', u'This is the second film in the series where Kyle Reese does not die.', u""The end battle pays homage to the endings of the first three Terminator films: Kyle slaps the evil Terminator across the head with a piece of metal as he did to the T-800 endoskeleton in The Terminator (1984); Sarah repeatedly shoots him with a shotgun as she did to the T-1000 in Terminator 2 (1991); and Arnold Schwarzenegger's T-800 holds him back to be destroyed as he did the T-X in Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003)."", u'This is the first installment in the Terminator franchise in which the same character from two different timelines meet with each other face to face (future and young Kyle Reese)', u'Arnold Schwarzenegger has approximately 30 minutes of screen time.', u""Even though most of the cast play characters with American accents except Arnold Schwarzenegger (T-800), most of the cast are not American.

In the original timeline, Sarah's father walked out on Sarah and her mother."", u'As in Terminator 2 (1991), the audience does not see through the first person perspective of the T-1000.', u""In the original timeline, Sarah's father walked out Sarah and her mother.

Which in that original ending, John Connor goes robotic and he succumbs to his injuries and his skin is transplanted over the Terminator endoskeleton of Marcus Wright. But the John Connor robot is taken over by SkyNet and wipes out the resistance.', u'The T-1000 (Byung-hun Lee) has only 15 to 20 minutes of screen time.', u""In the backstory behind Sarah's father: Sarah's father was a soldier whom fought in a war (most likely the Vietnam War) and he walked out on Sarah and her mother."", u'In the narrative behind John questioning Kyle on why he is volunteering to go back to 1984 and protect Sarah.

Schwarzenegger's exit as governor and his cameo appearance in Stallone's The Expendables (2010) prompted the two of them to revisit the idea of working together in both this movie and The Expendables 2 (2012)."", u'During filming on Bourbon Street in New Orleans, a military convention caused streams of uniformed soldiers and Marines to accidentally stumble onto the set. When the crew began to clear the set for the shoot, Sylvester Stallone made a point to stop and pose for pictures with multiple men and women in uniform.', u'The passage that Rottmayer quotes in German is the Parable of the Madman from ""The Gay Science"" by Friedrich Nietzsche, making this film one of less than a handful of films in which Arnold Schwarzenegger is heard speaking in his native language.', u'(At around 63 mins) Abigail is seen at Breslin\'s desk. On this desk are a few puzzle-like models, one of which appears to depict the structure of the infamous ""super-chip"" from Cyberdyne Systems as shown in the Terminator movies, which Arnold Schwarzenegger was in.', u'The German dubbing studio decided to recast the voice of Arnold Schwarzenegger with Ralph Schicha (who used a slight Austrian accent which adds a little extra fun for German audiences (since Danneberg normally dubs Schwarzenegger in Standard German)). The reason for this was that Thomas Danneberg, who normally dubs Schwarzenegger, is also the German dubbing voice of Sylvester Stallone. It was feared that the same voice for two actors might confuse audiences. However, some fans did not like the decision and pleaded for a new dubbing which was ultimately denied by the German licensee Concorde.', u""Miles Chapman's original script had called for the electronic keypad to be on the inside of the solitary cell at the Bendwater prison in Colorado. While storyboarding the film's opening sequence, the filmmakers realized that this was a mistake and the keypad was relocated to the outside of the cell."", u""Hobbes working on butterflies is a reference to the film Papillon (1973) in which a convict repeatedly tries to escape Devil's Island. Papillon is French for butterfly."", u'Bruce Willis was once attached to star in this film with Antoine Fuqua directing.', u'The message Ray Breslin (Sylvester Stallone) is seen ""tapping"" out is, ""Riot C block ramp during transfer riot C block"".', u'Screenwriter Jason Keller is credited under the pseudonym of Arnell Jesko, an anagram of his own name.', u'Escape Plan did not receive a theatrical release in Australia, instead Australian distributors Hopscotch Films decided to release the film directly to DVD and Blu-Ray.', u'The bulk of the page of the Bible that Ray Breslin (Sylvester Stallone) is seen burning at the beginning of the film says, ""6 Thou hast forsaken me, saith the LORD, thou art gone backward: therefore will I stretch out my hand against thee, and destroy thee; I am weary with repenting."". This is Jeremiah 15:6 of the King James Bible.', u'This was the third prison-themed movie for Sylvester Stallone. The previous two were Victory (1981) and Lock Up (1989).', u'When Faran Tahir\'s character (Javed) says ""God is Great"" Jim Caviezel character (Hobbes) replies with ""Eh, Whatever"". This is a possible reference to Jim Caviezel\'s role as ""Jesus Christ"" in The Passion of the Christ (2004).', u'The photograph hanging behind Lester Clark in his office shows the towers of the headquarter of Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt/Main in Germany.', u'Hobbes (Jim Caviezel) looks at the butterfly on his desk through a magnifying glass, much like he does the inmates via the cameras. The other one is ""caged"" much like the inmates are as well.', u'50 Cent was offered the role of Caesar in The Expendables, which Stallone directed and starred in. He turned it down to focus on his music career.', u'Jim Caviezel previously appeared in The Count of Monte Cristo (2002), where a large part of the plot involved planning an escape from a seemingly inescapable prison.', u""Sam Neill starred in Jurassic Park (1993) & Jurassic Park III (2001), Vincent D'Onofrio co-stars in the latest installment, Jurassic World (2015)."", u'Arnold Schwarzenegger was the original choice for John Brennick in the futuristic prison flick Fortress (1992), but Schwarzenegger turned the role down and the role was given to Christopher Lambert. Fortress (1992) was considered to be a futuristic remake of the prison flick Lock Up (1989) starring Sylvester Stallone.', u""In Stallone's previous film, Bullet To The Head, his partner comments that there was not enough evidence to court Marshall him for selling C4 on the black market, as is on Stallone's police file. In Escape Plan, his characters' alias in the prison is there for manufacturing bombs used in acts of terrorism."", u'While filming Arnold Schwarzenegger\'s scenes in the helicopter, director Mikael H\xe5fstr\xf6m asked writer Miles Chapman to add a line for Rottmayer after the explosion on the ship. Chapman realized that earlier in the film Warden Hobbes had said ""Have a lovely day, Mr. Rottmayer."" Chapman then added the line ""Have a lovely day, asshole"" for Rottmayer. Chapman said he has received requests from fans to come up with a t-shirt with the line ""Have a lovely day, asshole"" on it.', u""Sylvester Stallone's last day on set was spent filming the scene in which his character Ray Breslin surfaces in the ocean and signals to the helicopter. Stallone had pulled his right bicep muscle the previous day and was unable to use his right arm. This is why he waves to the helicopter and starts to climb the rope ladder with his left arm."", u'The cargo ship converted to a prison in this movie is Rican, IMO number 7621932. This can be seen in the scenes from the engine room towards the end of the movie. In the movie they have actually doubled the beam of the ship, making two rows of cargo holds and when widening the superstructure, they have left the wheelhouse off center and original size. The ship was scrapped after the filming in Alang, India.', u'The message Dr. Kyrie (Sam Neill) is seen sending out is, ""I need you in 24 hrs 30 degrees 22(n), 23 degrees 6(w) 5:00 pm sharp tomorrow BBQ and pool party. Don\'t forget to tell the kids bring all the toys! - Rottmayer"".', u'After Abigail (Amy Ryan) and Hush (50 Cent) decoded the message that Ray Breslin (Sylvester Stallone) sent out from Bendwater Federal Penitentiary toward the beginning of the film, it said, ""SEPTEMBER NINE FIRE FRONT LOT 4 PM"".', u'The prison in this film is very similar to Erewhon Prison in Face/Off (1997), in which Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone were considered to play arch enemies Sean Archer and Castor Troy before John Travolta and Nicolas Cage got the parts.', u""Steven E. De Souza stated the Commando 2 script for Arnold Schwarzenegger was a lot like this film, (and not Die Hard (1988)) even though it was set in a building with security and bad guys, etc. Coincidentally, Arnold and Sly were considered to play John McClane in Die Hard (1988), but they turned it down and it went to their pal, Planet Hollywood co-founder and Expendables (2010) co-star Bruce Willis, who was considered for Stallone's role in this film."", u'Just like in First Blood (1982), there is a scene where Stallone and his guard are going to the cell. In First Blood (1982), they first have to take stairs to reach it. But in both movies the door is at their left side, and the keypad is also at the left, but in First Blood (1982), it is mounted much higher. A lot of the same body language is used by Stallone in both movies when he is pushed around by the guard.', u""The prison alarm that you hear blaring as breslin and rottmayer make their escape is the same alarm that was also heard in the John Carpenter's 1982 horror sci-fi film The Thing.""]","[u'USA::18 July 2013 (San Diego Comic-Con)', u'Philippines::9 October 2013', u'United Arab Emirates::10 October 2013', u'Kuwait::10 October 2013', u'Lebanon::10 October 2013', u'Malaysia::10 October 2013', u'Brazil::11 October 2013', u'Estonia::11 October 2013', u'Lithuania::11 October 2013', u'Latvia::11 October 2013', u'Mexico::11 October 2013', u'USA::15 October 2013 (New York City, New York)\n (premiere)', u'Pakistan::16 October 2013', u'Azerbaijan::17 October 2013', u'Bosnia and Herzegovina::17 October 2013', u'Bolivia::17 October 2013', u'Belarus::17 October 2013', u'Switzerland::17 October 2013 (Italian speaking region)', u'Czech Republic::17 October 2013', u'Denmark::17 October 2013', u'Croatia::17 October 2013', u'Israel::17 October 2013', u'Italy::17 October 2013', u'Netherlands::17 October 2013', u'Russia::17 October 2013', u'Slovenia::17 October 2013', u'Slovakia::17 October 2013', u'Thailand::17 October 2013', u'Ukraine::17 October 2013', u'Canada::18 October 2013', u'Colombia::18 October 2013', u'UK::18 October 2013', u'Indonesia::18 October 2013', u'Ireland::18 October 2013', u'India::18 October 2013', u'Taiwan::18 October 2013', u'USA::18 October 2013', u'Hungary::24 October 2013', u'Cambodia::24 October 2013', u'Portugal::24 October 2013', u'Singapore::24 October 2013', u'Bulgaria::25 October 2013', u'Romania::25 October 2013', u'Vietnam::25 October 2013', u'Egypt::30 October 2013', u'Argentina::31 October 2013', u'Finland::31 October 2013 (Night Visions Film Festival)', u'Greece::31 October 2013', u'Republic of Macedonia::31 October 2013', u'Uruguay::31 October 2013', u'Serbia::2 November 2013 (Cinemania, Belgrade)', u'China::4 November 2013', u'Hong Kong::7 November 2013', u'Iceland::8 November 2013', u'Belgium::13 November 2013', u'Switzerland::13 November 2013 (French speaking region)', u'France::13 November 2013', u'Malta::13 November 2013', u'Switzerland::14 November 2013 (German speaking region)', u'Germany::14 November 2013', u'Austria::15 November 2013', u'Finland::15 November 2013', u'Serbia::28 November 2013', u'Norway::29 November 2013', u'Spain::5 December 2013', u'South Korea::5 December 2013', u'New Zealand::5 December 2013', u'Poland::6 December 2013', u'Sweden::6 December 2013', u'Peru::1 January 2014', u'Venezuela::3 January 2014', u'Japan::10 January 2014', u'Turkey::10 January 2014', u'Nicaragua::26 January 2014', u'Ecuador::31 January 2014', u'Australia::19 February 2014 (DVD premiere)', u'Chile::27 March 2014']"

(a popular internet meme) in the screenplay. Norris\'s wife Gena O\'Kelly suggested him the one with the cobra. (""Chuck Norris was bitten by a cobra, and after five days of excruciating pain... the cobra died."")', u'Sylvester Stallone explained that his casting was looking particularly for actors who had not experienced recent hits: ""I like using people that had a moment and then maybe have fallen on some hard times and give them another shot. I like those kinds of guys. Someone did it for me and I like to see if I can do it for them.""', u'Chuck Norris agreed to come out of retirement from acting at the age of 71 in order to appear in this film.', u'The film reveals that Gunnar Jensen (Dolph Lundgren) has an advance degree of chemical engineering. This is a reference to Lundgren himself, who earned a degree in chemistry from Washington State University in 1976, a degree in chemical engineering from the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm in the early 1980s, then a Master\'s Degree in Chemical Engineering from the University of Sydney in Sydney in 1982. The character abandoned his career a scientist to work as bouncer in order to impress a girl. In real life, Lundgren turned it down to work as bodyguard for his then girlfriend Grace Jones. Further, while stuck in the mine Gunnar refers to himself as a ""Fulbright Scholar"" which Lundgren also achieved in real life.', u'Gunner Jensen refers to Chuck Norris\' character Booker as the ""Lone Wolf"". This is a reference to the Chuck Norris movie Lone Wolf McQuade (1983).', u'John Travolta and Nicolas Cage were considered to work with Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone in this film. Ironically 15 years previously, Travolta and Cage took the roles of Sean Archer and Castor Troy in Face/Off (1997) which was made and written for Stallone and Schwarzenegger.', u'A stuntman died and another was left in a critical condition while filming an action scene for the movie in Bulgaria, that included an explosion on a rubber boat.', u'Tennis player Novak Djokovic filmed a cameo for the airport shootout for free. However his scene, which involved him beating down terrorists with his racket, was cut.', u'Liam Hemsworth was originally cast in The Expendables (2010) but when the script was re-written, his role was cut out. He later got a call from Sylvester Stallone to be in this movie.', u""The sequel was considered seven months before The Expendables (2010) was completed and released in theaters. The first movie's plot was revised during filming so that Dolph Lundgren's character, who was killed in the first draft, could be saved for the sequel."", u'Sylvester Stallone canceled his promotional tour for this film after his son Sage Stallone was found dead July 13th, 2012.', u'In September 2011 Sylvester Stallone confirmed that he was in talks with Nicolas Cage and John Travolta about roles in the film and that scheduling would be the only obstacle to their involvement.', u'A real railway bridge over the river Osam in Bulgaria was built for the film, and will remain as part of the railway network.', u'Liam Hemsworth\'s character Billy the Kid\'s back story is based on the real story of Dakota Meyer\'s experience in Afghanistan as told in his book ""Into the Fire"".', u'Arnold Schwarzenegger shot his role in 5 days, one week prior to beginning work on The Last Stand (2013).', u'In the battle scene with all the Expendables and the Sangs there are many tongue-in-cheek references to the actors other films such as Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis saying ""I\'ll be back"" (many of Arnold Schwarzenegger); Arnold Schwarzenegger saying ""Yippie-Kai-Yay"" (in reference to Bruce Willis ""Die Hard"" series) and later asking ""Who\'s next, Rambo?""

The name of Chuck Norris was most often associated with this story, that he was having problems with the extreme violence and basically refusing to take part in the movie unless it would be toned down.', u""In an interview with BBC Radio, Sylvester Stallone confirmed that he named Jean-Claude Van Damme's character 'Vilain' to make it similar to the name of 19th Century French poet Paul Verlaine. This was to set up an extremely obscure in-joke where the final showdown between Van Damme and Stallone, could be seen as a fight between Vilain/Verlaine and Rambo/Rimbaud.

It includes a skull and other symbols inspired by The Expendables (2010).', u'In November 2010, Charlie Sheen was considered for the role of a CIA agent hunting down Church. The role was eventually written out of the script.', u'Sylvester Stallone wrote and starred in this installment, unlike his duties in the previous The Expendables (2010) as an actor, co-writer, co-producer and director.', u'Only the third time Schwarzenegger has used the paraphrase, ""I\'m back"". The first was in Kindergarten Cop (1990) and the second was Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003).', u'Chuck Norris is the pop culture subject of countless larger than life ""Chuck Norris facts"" created by fans.

The other was Universal Soldier: Day of Reckoning. Also the fourth movie starring Van Damme and Lundgren after Universal Soldier (1992), Universal Soldier: Regeneration (2009) and Universal Soldier: Day of Reckoning (2012). And the only collaboration with the two action stars that is not a Universal Soldier film.', u'At the start of the film, Sylvester Stallone drives a 4x4 with a heavy metal plow on the rear. When he spins the vehicle and drives with the plow facing front, his 4x4 bears more than a passing resemblance to a vehicle from Judge Dredd, another Sylvester Stallone film.', u'Just like the movie Rambo, which also stars sly Stallone - there is an Australian sniper with the Barret 50 cal. Sniper rifle.', u""The song Expendables sing in the closing scene is composed of several unrelated verses from the 1912 poem 'Congo' by Vachel Lindsay."", u""Scott Adkins, who played Jean-Claude Van Damme's right hand man, played the main character in the movie Hard Target 2 (2016). It is the direct-to-video sequel of the film Hard Target (1993) where Van-Damme played the main character."", u'Near the end of the movie, Barney Ross says ""That thing belongs in a museum."" This was a famous line from Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989). Coincidentially, Harrison Ford, who played Indiana Jones, appeared as CIA Agent Drummer in Expendables 3 (2014), after Bruce Willis refused to return as Mr. Church. Harrison Ford, like Arnold and Sly, was offered to play John McClane in Die Hard but turned it down and the role then went to Bruce Willis.', u""The working storyline had Mickey Rourke from The Expendables (2010) returning as Tool and being killed off as the motivation for the team's subsequent actions. This was changed to Liam Hemsworth's character when Rourke abruptly left the production to pursue another project."", u'In the final scene, Arnold Schwarzenegger is wearing a vintage Hawaiian style Planet Hollywood Jam shirt under his jacket. Schwarzenegger, Sylvester Stallone, and Bruce Willis were founding partners in the Planet Hollywood chain.', u'Body Count: 482.', u'Arnold Schwarzenegger, in this film says ""Yippie Kai Yay"", (a reference to Bruce Willis\'s role in Die Hard (1988) as John McClane), after he says ""I\'ll be back"", when Bruce Willis steals his line.

for a long time Arnold Schwarzenegger refused to do it unless James Cameron was directing. Cameron eventually told his friend to ""Just do it and ask for a shit-load of money"", reasoning that the character was as much Schwarzenegger\'s as it was his. Schwarzenegger confirmed this in a talk-show interview, saying that when he asked, Cameron told him to ""take the money and run"".', u'The gas station at which the Terminator stops for refueling is the same gas station seen in all three Terminator movies.

It's believed that the red-haired girl was indeed Kate Brewster, and it is possible that John told Kate that he was going to the Galleria when they were in Mike Kripke's basement, the night before, which was the same night the T-800 and the T-1000 arrived from the future."", u'Arnold Schwarzenegger\'s signature line ""I\'ll be back"" is not uttered in this film.

His contract was 33 pages long and written by Hollywood super-lawyer Jake Bloom between June 2000 and December 2001. It was written into the contract as a ""pay or play"" fee, meaning he would get paid whether or not the movie was made. His ""perk package"" included a lump sum of $1.5 million for private jets, a fully equipped gym trailer, three-bedroom deluxe suites on location, round-the-clock limousines, and personal bodyguards. He also insisted on, and got, 20% of the gross receipts made by the venture from every market in the world-including movie theaters, videos, DVDs, television licensing, in-flight entertainment, game licensing, and so forth-once the movie had reached its cash break-even point. Such ""contingent compensation"" is not unusual in movie contracts, but, in most cases, Hollywood accounting famously uses smoke and mirrors to make sure to define ""break-even"" in such a way that a movie never reaches it. Schwarzenegger also could decide who worked with him. The contract ""pre-approval"" clause gave him choice of not only the director (Jonathan Mostow) and the principal cast, but also his hairdresser (Peter Toothbal), his makeup man (Jeff Dawn), his driver (Howard Valesco), his stand-in (Dieter Rauter), his stunt double (Billy Lucas), the unit publicist (Sheryl Merin), his personal physician (Dr. Graham Waring), and his cook (Steve Hunter). The negotiation of this contract did not come cheaply. The legal and accounting budget for the movie was $2 million. By the time all of Schwarzenegger\'s demands were met, the budget of the film had risen to $187.3 million, making it the most expensive independently produced movie in history.', u'Nick Stahl had to audition five times and go through three screen tests before he was chosen for the part of John Connor. However, he did turn down this role in Terminator Salvation (2009).', u""The character of Kate Brewster's fianc\xe9 was originally named Scott Petersen. Due to the name's similarity to Scott Peterson (a California man convicted of murdering his pregnant wife and their unborn child (named Conner, as a matter of fact) in late 2002 while out fishing) and the plot of his fianc\xe9e's kidnapping, the character's name was changed to Scott Mason, although he's still listed as Scott Petersen in the credits."", u'The skulls in the future scenes were made from ping-pong balls.', u'Arnold Schwarzenegger put up $1.4 million of his salary to ensure that a key scene in which a construction crane smashes into a glass building was shot.

In the German dub, he calls himself ""Arnold Beckenbauer"" (""Pool-Builder""), which creates additional comedy, since it is also the name of one of Germany\'s most famous soccer players.', u'During the shooting of the movie, Arnold Schwarzenegger gave an interview on the set to Dagmar Koller, a famous Austrian musical-star, for an Austrian television show. After the interview, Schwarzenegger invited her to appear in the movie. She can be seen in the police headquarters as Danny talks to her.', u'The police station is the lobby of an administration building on the Sony Pictures lot. It was also used as the lobby of the television station in The Running Man (1987), which also starred Arnold Schwarzenegger', u'Body Count: eighty-three.', u'After Benedict murders the car mechanic and wants to confess, someone in the background is carrying a pair of recently stolen shoes.', u'The film ran behind schedule, so much so that there was just one test screening that ran for two hours and twenty minutes with a lot of inaudible dialogue, boring the audience. The studio refused to delay the opening, so as not to send the message the film was in trouble, a decision Arnold Schwarzenegger agreed with.', u""Before the Hamlet sequence, wherein the Laurence Olivier version Hamlet (1948) is played on a projector, the teacher who introduces the film is Joan Plowright, Olivier's third wife and widow. Noting her students' apparent ignorance of Olivier's storied career, she tells them they may remember him as Zeus in Clash of the Titans (1981), one of Olivier's final roles."", u'Some trailers show a few deleted and alternate scenes, such as an extended Hamlet action scene where Arnold Schwarzenegger is in some water shooting at someone, Danny being blown away into the movie after dynamite pops out of screen, and an alternate take and angle for Slater\'s ""I hate when that happens"" line after he gets out of the tar pit. A couple other deleted scenes are from the original 140 minutes long rough cut include dialogue scene between Danny and Jack in which Danny says how his father died from cancer and a scene where a group of kids see Jack while he is walking across the street in the rain with Danny looking for Benedict and they think he is Schwarzenegger, so they ask him for his autograph which he signs.', u""In 1993, after attending the world premiere, Robin Quivers from the Howard Stern Show said it was the best movie she'd ever seen."", u""The filming involved a 3:00 pm to 3:00 am, 7-day, shutdown of six-block Times Square area in New York City for the production. Originally, a giant 75-foot balloon of Arnold Schwarzenegger held three few sticks of dynamite in the balloon's hand but, following the then-recent 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center, Richard Brick, Commissioner of the New York City Mayor's Office of Film, Theatre and Broadcasting and Gary Martin, President of Production at Columbia Pictures agreed to change the prop to a badge."", u'When Danny and Jack are looking in the video store for the action section to find a ""Schwarzenegger"" film. Danny is surprised and confused to see that Terminator 2 (1991)\'s poster features Sylvester Stallone and that apparently Schwarzenegger films do not exist. However, as Jack walks towards Danny to compliment Stallone\'s work, on the shelf alongside a number of other known Hollywood films of the time, a VHS tape of one of Arnold Schwarzenegger\'s earlier films Raw Deal (1986) is clearly visible, with Arnold featuring prominently on the cover.', u'Due to delays with the film Hook (1991), this was the first movie released in SDDS (Sony Dynamic Digital Sound). With five front channels and two rears, it was also the first film to include a 7.1 channel SDDS mix, rather than the more common 5.1 SDDS.', u""While Danny is in the movie, he says John Practice (F. Murray Abraham) killed Mozart, a reference to the movie Amadeus (1984), where Abraham played Antonio Salieri. Later in the film, when Slater and Danny's mom are talking, the Overture to The Marriage of Figaro can be heard, composed by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart."", u""Benedict's pistol is a Dan Wesson .357 revolver. Most noted for its interchangeable barrels on the same frame, from two inches to ten inches. Slater carries a Desert Eagle .50 caliber Action Express."", u'The fact that Jack Slater was out to avenge the death of his second cousin Frank in ""Jack Slater IV"" was an intentionally ridiculous element. The idea was that having gone through so many epic, personal conflicts with super-villains during the first three films, Jack Slater was left to battle the mob due to the death of a very minor character. This would also allow the Danny Madigan character to start listing the flaws of the Jack Slater films, as well as how they were running out of good ideas.', u'The first time Arnold Schwarzenegger took a producing credit on a film.', u'In the film, the characters are able to enter and leave the movie world via a magic ticket which is credited to famous stage illusionist and escapologist Harry Houdini. However, in real-life, Houdini was firmly opposed to the idea of supernatural powers, and spent his time debunking fake spiritualists and phony mediums.', u'The name of the boss gangster, Tony Vivaldi, is a spoof of the famous classical composer Antonio Vivaldi. Jokes about classical music are a recurring theme in this movie.', u'In one scene, Jack says to Danny, regarding his ex-wife, ""Do you think I would marry someone so stupid that doesn\'t know the real voice from a taped one?"" In Arnold Schwarzenegger\'s next film, True Lies (1994), he uses a taped voice to fool his wife.', u""Sir Ian McKellen plays Death, a character out of Ingmar Bergman's film The Seventh Seal (1957). In that film, Death was played by Swedish actor Bengt Ekerot."", u'Tori Spelling had a cameo as herself but it was eventually left on the cutting room floor.', u'The film makes several oblique references to the Governor of Los Angeles. These are eerily prescient statements to make with Arnold Schwarzenegger later becoming the Governor of California.', u'Charles Dance replaced Timothy Dalton as Benedict. Had this not happened, this would have been the second of two movies with Dalton and Frank McRae, even though they would not have had any screentime together. The first was Licence to Kill (1989).', u'Tony Curtis was cast in a major cameo but was replaced.', u'Jean-Claude Van Damme features in the premiere scene. He would later star opposite Arnold Schwarzenegger in The Expendables 2 (2012).', u""Danny's New York City apartment is unit number 3D, an indication that he lives in the real world, as opposed to the 2-D world of Jack's movies."", u'Final on-screen appearance of Professor Toru Tanaka.', u'In Blockbuster, there is a cardboard cutout for Terminator 2 (1991). The actor shown instead of Arnold Schwarzenegger is Sylvester Stallone.', u'Little Richard has a cameo as himself in this film. In Predator (1987), another John McTiernan movie starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, his ""Long Tall Sally"" was featured prominently, both on the radio and sung by one of the characters.', u'The scenes that are playing on the television in Blockbuster, are from the movie Thunderheart (1992).', u'This movie features two actors who played the character of Antonio Salieri: F.

Murray Abraham, Art Carney, Mercedes Ruehl, and Anthony Quinn) and six Oscar nominees (Sir Ian McKellen, Sharon Stone, Sylvester Stallone, Joan Plowright, Michael V. Gazzo, and Danny DeVito).', u'The role of Benedict was originally intended for William Atherton.', u'Nick tells Jack Slater that politicians are ""twice as bad as anything else."" Arnold Schwarzenegger went on to become Governor of California.', u'Charles Dance has said in interviews, that his part was written with Alan Rickman in mind, and suspects Rickman passed on the project.', u'Film debut of Angie Everhart.', u'(At around thirty-two minutes) On the upper right hand corner for the logo for the City of Los Angeles (the fountain for the LAPD) the bear has been changed to a rhinoceros.', u'Final cinema film of Michael V.

Slater: Desert Eagle .50 caliber Action Express; Benedict: Custom Dan Wesson Revolver .357 Magnum; Danny: SIG-Sauer P230; Vivaldi: Walther PPK custom engraved; Criminals: MP5K-PDW, M3A1 Grease Gun, and Intratec TEC-9 sub-machine guns; Slater/Hamlet: Switches from MAC-11 to MP5K; Van: Short Barreled Minigun. Whitney: Colt Python .357 Magnum; S.W.A.T. member: Colt Commando.', u'Producer Mark Canton optioned the script for three hundred fifty thousand dollars.', u'This was the first film to use the 1993 Columbia Pictures logo.', u'The real City Coat of Arms for Los Angeles has the American federal shield (a white field with six red thin vertical stripes on the field - creating the illusion of seven white, and six red stripes, for a total of thirteen stripes, and thirteen white stars in the blue Chief) in the first quarter (upper left quadrant of the field); the California state flag (A five-point star in the upper right corner of the field, a grizzly bear, and a horizontal stripe in the base; all in red) in the second quarter (upper right quadrant of the field); the Mexican eagle atop a green cactus (from the Mexican flag) in the third quarter (lower left quadrant), and the parted arms of alliance for Castile and Leon (representing Spain) in the fourth quarter (lower right quadrant of the field). When Jack Slater pulls into the parking lot at Police Headquarters (actually a Sony Pictures office building), the Los Angeles Coat of Arms out front, has the American eagle (with a federal shield with four stars in the Chief in escutcheon) instead of the Mexican eagle in the third quarter, and a black rhinoceros (instead of the red Bear) in the California state flag in the second quarter.', u'When Jack Slater punches the Lieutenant Governor and says: ""When the Governor gets here, call me."" Arnold Schwarzenegger went on to be the Governor of California.', u""(At around thirty-nine minutes) In the video store, Jack Slater's hand is resting almost right next to a DVD case for The Road Warrior (1981), which was the inspiration for The Terminator (1984), with Arnold Schwarzenegger in the title role. This is also during the conversation with Danny Madigan about how it was supposed to be Arnold in Terminator 2 (1991), but instead had Sylvester Stallone."", u'John McTiernan and Composer Michael Kamen also collaborated on Die Hard (1988) and Die Hard with a Vengeance (1995).', u'The Region 2 PAL United Kingdom DVD includes German, Italian, French, and Spanish audio tracks as well as the original English. It also features a ""Making-of"" documentary and an AC/DC music video for their song, ""Big Gun"".', u'Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sir Ian McKellen went on to play super villains. Schwarzenegger as Mr. Freeze in Batman & Robin (1997), and McKellen as Magneto in the X-Men franchise.', u'Anthony Quinn and Charles Dance have co-starred with Madeleine Stowe. These films were Revenge (1990) and China Moon (1994) respectively.', u'Arnold Schwarzenegger\'s name is mentioned in the song ""Jump Around"" by House of Pain in Mrs. Doubtfire (1993). Robert Prosky was also in that film, plus Cinematographer Donald McAlpine had filmed Predator (1987), also directed by John McTiernan, and which also starred Schwarzenegger. They reunited with this film.', u'There are similarities to Die Hard (1988), like Jack Slater falling from the building and elevator, like Hans Gruber in Die Hard (1988), which was also directed by John McTiernan. Arnold Schwarzenegger was considered for the part of John McClane, before Bruce Willis got the part. Arnold and Bruce later worked on The Expendables (2010) and The Expendables 2 (2012).', u'When Danny Madigan says to Jack Slater, ""They always look dead. Like in Die Hard. The guy\'s hanging there by his neck and at the end of the movie he comes back"", after the car crash scene in New York involving Benedict and the Tough Asian Man, Danny referenced Die Hard (1988) previously directed by John McTiernan. In addition, Professor Toru Tanaka\'s bad guy in this film was killed by Arnold Schwarzenegger\'s good guy, just like in The Running Man (1987). Tanaka yet again came to a sticky end with Schwarzenegger.', u'When Jack kills The Ripper, The Ripper says, ""I\'ll be back!"", to which Jack replies, ""the hell you will!"" The line, ""I\'ll be back"" has traditionally been used by Arnold Schwarzenegger in many movies since he first said it in The Terminator (1984).', u'Robert Prosky\' (qv}\'s character, Nick was originally going to turn out to be the Devil, but this was nixed by the producers.

He is clearly much younger in the desert, for instance, than in other scenes. His voice began to break, and had to be pitched to one level in post-production.', u'Until The Bourne Ultimatum (2007), this was the only sequel to win an Academy Award when the previous installment(s) received no nomination.', u'A female passer-by actually wandered onto the biker bar set thinking it was real, despite walking past all the location trucks, cameras and lights. Seeing Arnold Schwarzenegger standing in the bar dressed only in boxer shorts, she wondered aloud what was going on, only for Schwarzenegger to reply that it was male stripper night. Whether coincidence or not, in Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003), the Terminator (played again by Schwarzenegger) actually steps into bar during a male stripper night.', u""For the Los Angeles River sequence, Arnold Schwarzenegger was in pain because, since he couldn't wear a glove while cocking the gun, his fingers would get stuck in the mechanism. He tore the skin from his fingers and hand many times before he mastered it; and he achieved this while trying to act and control a Harley at the same time as James Cameron told him where to look. He couldn't dart his eyes either because it would have ruined the shot. Shooting the gates also took weeks of practice because he had to also act cool while doing it."", u'In the audio commentary, James Cameron says that not only was the biker bar scene filmed across the street from where LAPD officers beat up Rodney King, but that they were filming the night of the beating.', u'Special Effects guru Stan Winston and his crew studied hours of nuclear test footage, in order to make Sarah Connor\'s ""nuclear nightmare"" scene look as realistic as possible. A miniature Los Angeles was made to simulate the scene. Some of the materials used in the miniature that mimicked all the destroyed masonry were Matzos crackers and Shredded Wheat. After each take, it would take on average two days to set the model up to shoot again. In late 1991, members of several U.S. federal nuclear testing labs unofficially declared it ""the most accurate depiction of a nuclear blast ever created for a fictional motion picture"". The special effects team members have also stated that no other scene that they ever worked on has elicited such strong emotions in viewers.', u'Robert Patrick trained in a rigorous running regime in order to be able to appear to run at high speeds without showing fatigue on film.', u'According to James Cameron, Linda Hamilton suffered permanent hearing loss in one ear during the elevator shootout because she had not replaced her ear plugs after removing them between takes.', u'Linda Hamilton learned to pick locks for the scene in the mental hospital where she does precisely that with a paperclip.', u'Linda Hamilton\'s twin sister, Leslie Hamilton Gearren was used as a double in scenes involving two ""Sarah Connors"" (for example, when the T-1000 was imitating her), and in a scene not in the theatrical release (but on the DVD) as a mirror image of Linda.', u'The Terminators seen at the beginning of the movie were fully workable animatronic models.', u'Given Arnold Schwarzenegger\'s fifteen million dollar salary, and his total of seven hundred words of dialogue, he was paid 21,429 dollars per word. ""Hasta la vista, baby"" cost 85,716 dollars.', u'This is the only Terminator film to win or be nominated for an Oscar. It won four, and was nominated for two others.', u'Carolco studio executives were nervous and concerned when the original budget of 75 million dollars ballooned up to 88 million dollars, with more to come. In order to keep the budget manageable, they proposed to eliminate a few scenes, particularly the opening biker bar scene where the Terminator was introduced. They tried to get Arnold Schwarzenegger to persuade James Cameron to remove that scene, but Schwarzenegger turned them down, saying, ""Only a studio guy would cut a scene out like that.""', u""One of the main percussive sounds of Brad Fiedel's score - the metallic beats of the Terminator theme - is not created by a synthesizer. It's Fiedel striking one of his cast-iron frying pans."", u'Robert Patrick mimicked the head movements of the American bald eagle for his role as T-1000.', u""The original script did not call for the top of the truck to be ripped off during the chase through the storm drain beside/beneath the freeway, but when they arrived on location they found that the cab wouldn't fit under the overpass so James Cameron decided that the roof was going to have to come off."", u'Pilot Charles A. Tamburro actually flew the helicopter under the overpass in the final chase scene. The camera crew refused to film the shot, because of the high risk involved. James Cameron did the filming with the help of the camera car driver.', u""Industrial Light and Magic's computer graphics department had to grow from six artists to almost 36 to accommodate all the work required to bring the T-1000 to life, costing 5.5 million dollars, and taking eight months to produce, which ultimately amounted to 3.5 minutes of screen time."", u'Michael Biehn was the first choice for the role of the T-1000, in a complete reversal of roles with Arnold Schwarzenegger, who was now a hero. But this idea was abandoned as it was judged too confusing for viewers.', u""Despite the film's R-rating, numerous children's toys were released, and were a financial success."", u'In the final scene, the lines ""I cannot self-terminate. You must lower me in the steel"" were looped by Arnold Schwarzenegger in post-production, because a test audience didn\'t understand why Terminator needed Sarah to help him terminate.', u""The sound used for Arnold Schwarzenegger's shotgun is actually two cannons."", u'The damaged Terminator look in the climax of the film took five hours to apply and an hour to remove.', u""James Cameron's own screams are used for the death throes of the T-1000."", u'The scene where the Terminator reboots after being ""shut down"" by the T-1000 was not in the script, and was added during editing, because James Cameron felt that the audience will not be able to understand how the Terminator returns to deliver the final blow against the T-1000. According to the Arnold Schwarzenegger book \'The Life and Times\', Cameron contacted Schwarzenegger, who was to go visit his friend Bruce Willis for Christmas, to come back for shooting that crucial scene. Ultimately, Schwarzenegger had to cancel his plans and film the scene.

However, he knew that half of the film's rights were owned by Hemdale (producer of The Terminator (1984)) - ultimately went bankrupt - and the lack of funding prevented him from working. While working on Total recall - unohda tai kuole (1990), with Mario Kassar and Andrew G.

Cameron didn't want the trailer to just be early footage, and so with a budget of 150,000 dollars, Winston created a trailer that showed a futuristic assembly line churning out copies of Terminators, all of which looked like Arnold Schwarzenegger.

Because of this punishing regimen, she declined to reprise her role for Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003).

Most of the sounds coming from weapons in the film were upgraded in post-production to create a sort of 'hyperreality'; handguns would get the sound of higher caliber guns, while shotguns would sound like cannons. The minigun used at the end originally made one loud monotonous sound because the shots are fired in such quick succession; the sound was slowed down considerably in post-production so that separate shots could be heard."", u'James Cameron fought over the ending with Mario Kassar. Cameron wanted to end the film with the alternate Coda Ending (the older Sarah in future) as a bookend, but Kassar wanted to end the film in an another way (as a measure for possible sequels).

The cut scene was of the staff coming in to give her the pills. She refuses, so they smack her in the gut with their batons and force the pills down her throat, then kick her while she\'s on the floor doubled over in pain.Another hospital scene was cut that took place after John Connor robs the ATM and heads for the mall. Sarah Connor was to have a dream where Reese appears and warns her that THEIR son is in danger. She has to save him, etc. They kiss and hug, but Reese disappears and walks out. Sarah chases him outside, to find herself in the same spot as the nuclear nightmare scene later in the movie. She sees the large white flash, and then she wakes up. This is the only scene that Michael Biehn was in, and appeared in some promotional trailers. Cameron cut the scene because he thought that audiences who had not seen the first movie would be confused by the appearance of Kyle.A scene showing the T-1000 at the scene of the crashed truck in the canal, where he steals a police car.After the T-1000 kills John\'s foster parents, he ventures outside and kills the dog to check it\'s nametag, which is stamped with the name ""Max"". The T-1000 does this because the Terminator hung up as soon as the T-1000 confirms the wrong name by calling the dog ""Wolfie"" and now knows John will not trust his \'parents\' and so gives up waiting for John to return home.After killing the dog, the T-1000 goes to John\'s room to try to find any clues as to where John might be. He stalks around the room waving his arms and ""feeling"" things on the shelves, on the walls, etc. He eventually stops in front of a poster, realizes there is something behind it, rips it down and finds a box of mementos (pictures, and the like). This must be where the T-1000 figures out about Sarah\'s current whereabouts, and the desert compound that Sarah, John, and the Terminator head to after the hospital. Director James Cameron decided to cut it because the T-1000\'s sampling abilities were already sufficiently conveyed in earlier scenes, so this scene became redundant (and because it made the T-1000 look too much like it had x-ray vision). This scene was NOT included in the SE.At the abandoned gas station, a scene involved Sarah and John talking with the Terminator about learning. He tells them that his CPU was switched to read-only before being sent out. Skynet doesn\'t want them to learn too much while on their own. John asks if it can be reset. You then see the Terminator\'s face in a ""mirror"" talking Sarah through the procedure. A puppet was used for the foreground Sarah to work on and Linda Hamilton\'s twin sister Leslie Hamilton Gearren was in the mirror mimicking Linda\'s hand movements. After the CPU is removed, the Terminator shuts-down and Sarah places it on a table. She picks up a hammer and tries to smash it to render him inoperative. John stops her and says they need him. He starts to show authority for the first time and asks her how he is supposed to be a great military leader if even his own mother won\'t listen to him. She reluctantly reinserts the chip back into the Terminator\'s head.A scene at a truck stop before John, Sarah and Terminator arrive at the Salceda farm. John points out to the Terminator that he shouldn\'t be so serious all the time. He encourages him to smile once in a while. The Terminator tries to perform a smile, but the result is less than convincing, so John encourages him to practice in front of a mirror.Directly after Terminator tells Sarah about Miles Dyson, there is a scene where Dyson is seen in his private residence, where his wife tells him he is much too focused on finishing his microchip, and Miles explains how his design will revolutionize artificial intelligence.Some more dialogue between John and the Terminator as they assemble weapons in the desert. John tells about his unusual childhood, and ask Terminator if he experiences emotions.Before Sarah takes aim at Dyson, she is seen approaching the house and setting up weapons.A scene in Cyberdyne, where Dyson destroys the model of his revolutionary microchip.In the steel mill, the T-1000 experiences some negative effects from being frozen earlier. It has difficulties maintaining his form when it touches other materials, like steel bars and the floor. This leads to another deleted shot, where John sees the two Sarahs and recognizes the fake one because its feet seem fused to the metal floor.A scene in a Skynet-free future, with Sarah Connor as an older woman giving a monologue about how Judgment Day no longer occurred, and John becoming a senator. This scene was NOT included in the SE, because James Cameron felt it just didn\'t fit the dark, gloomy atmosphere of the rest of the movie.', u'Arnold Schwarzenegger said during the making of this film that he would never play another evil character again, but he later played the villain Mr. Freeze in Batman & Robin (1997).', u""The name of Arnold Schwarzenegger's Terminator is the Terminator Series 800 (shiny metal endoskeleton) model 101 (Arnold's actual skin on that skeleton)."", u'Because of the amount of make-up Arnold Schwarzenegger had to wear for the climax, he was blinded in one eye and had no depth perception.', u""The special effects crew had to incorporate Robert Patrick's football-injury limp in their animation of the T-1000.

For the final film, the scenes were flipped left-to-right to make it all look right, and combined with footage shot with a normal truck driving in the drain.

For all of the mayhem and violence in this movie, sixteen (at the most) characters actually die, and only one of these by gunfire. Of the people who get killed, there are three soldiers, the armored truck driver and his gunner, the cop on patrol, Lewis the guard, a mall employee, Todd and Janelle Voight, the cop on the motorcycle (copied by T-1000 and therefore implied to have been terminated off-screen), Dr. Miles Bennett Dyson, and the tanker truck driver. The trucker pulled from his truck by T-1000 as he is in pursuit of John makes a bad fall, but probably survived. It\'s not exactly certain if the police helicopter pilot dies (he falls from a high place but may have suffered only some broken bones). The pickup truck driver is probably not in danger of dying as he does not jump off of the bridge, but only jumps over the center divider in the middle of the bridge. A subplot was scripted where the T-1000 tracks down Enrique Salceda and kills him, but it was not filmed and not alluded to in the finished movie (Sarah even suggest that he go into hiding himself). The T-1000 is directly or indirectly responsible for most of the deaths. The Terminator only injures people. According to a biographical documentary, Arnold Schwarzenegger only agreed to do the sequel if his role was more family-friendly, hence the ""no killing"" rule written for his character. However, on the DVD audio commentary, James Cameron states that he had to convince Schwarzenegger that his character could no longer kill people.', u""Because of Edward Furlong's small stature during filming, his stunt double, who was older and larger, used a bigger version of the dirt bike for filming the chase scene."", u""When John takes off on his motorbike from the mall chased by the T-1000, he is riding a Honda XR 80 or 100, which has a 4-cycle engine.

Reese talks to John before he volunteers to be sent through time; it is implied that Reese learns that he is in fact John\'s father. After Reese is sent, John enters a storage cabinet full of Terminators (different types even). One of the 101-models is missing (being the Terminator from the first movie). John hints that he needs to send another one himself. After that, the rest of the movie is effectively one long flashback of John. - Sarah\'s ECT where Sarah is fitted for electro-convulsive therapy and voltage is pumped into her. She relives several moments from her life, most prominently the T-800 chasing her through the factory in the previous film. - Alternate nuclear nightmare scene. Sarah dreams that the Terminator takes her out of the asylum towards the fence, where she sees nuclear silos opening, firing their missiles. One nuclear bomb goes off, ripping off both her flesh and the Terminator\'s. Then she wakes up. - Salceda\'s death sequence. Sal\'s dog starts barking, Sal goes out tries to shoot the T-1000 and fails. T-1000 uses the pointed finger/sword trick to Sal\'s shoulder blades saying ""I know this hurts. Where is John Connor"". Sal curses him and his hands search around the ground near some crates that hold grenades. He blows himself up and hopefully the T-1000 with one. No luck. T-1000 head falls off but like the little piece in the asylum escape sequence, it oozes back into his boots. Yolanda sees this and hugs the baby as T-1000 steps closer. T-1000 picks up the baby and gets the info from her as where John and others had gone. - Gant Ranch. This section was a longer version of Sal\'s and refers to Travis Gant, ""crazy ex-Green Beret"" that John mentions his mother seeing before she was caught. Longer and has romantic notions between the two. After Sarah, John and the Terminator left, T-1000 kills Gant as he did like with John\'s ""Mom"". Disguised as Gant\'s lover, he easily stepped up to him and tortured him for answers before killing him. Dyson\'s Vision Sequence.

The gun used the same custom Y-frame as in Predator with some modifications. The modified M60 fore-grip assembly was removed in its entirety. To replace it a ""chainsaw"" grip was mounted on the Y-frame and the M16-style carry handle was removed. This style of carry has become the ""standard"" for hand-held Miniguns in movies and video games. The Y-frame is still attached to the weapon\'s mounting lugs, though with no carry handle, the weapon lost its sling attachment point, forcing Arnold to carry all the weight of the weapon in his hands. In order to fire it, the Terminator carries a duffel bag full of ammo and possibly the batteries as well, as there are some shots that show what appear to be cables leading from the gun and into the duffel bag.

In the earlier drafts of the script, Quaid (originally named Quail) was originally described as an average-looking accountant-type person. Because of this detail, when the movie was originally going to be produced by Dino De Laurentiis, he was adamant about not letting Schwarzenegger audition for the role of Quaid. It was only after Schwarzenegger convinced Mario Kassar to buy the script rights from De Laurentiis (whose production company went bankrupt) that the later drafts were re-written to change Quaid's character into one more suitable for Schwarzenegger to play. Schwarzenegger said that he felt this helped the story even more, giving a much stronger contrast to it by turning a character who is otherwise powerful physically into a character that becomes vulnerable after having his mind stolen."", u'All of the crew fell ill due to food poisoning during production, with the exception of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Ronald Shusett. Schwarzenegger escaped because he always had his food catered from the US. This was because three years earlier, he had fallen ill due to drinking tap water in Mexico during production of Predator (1987). As for Shusett, he took extreme health precautions, such as only brushing his teeth with boiled or bottled water and insisting on getting a weekly vitamin B12 shot.

As opposed to being confined to the site of an earthquake in California in the film, Richards can travel anywhere in the world to evade the Hunters, but must videotape two messages per day and courier them to the Games Network or forfeit his money. Richards, a Caucasian male, shows signs of racism early on in the novel, but is taken in by the Throckmortons, an African-American family in Boston, and after he is told of the situation the government forces them to live in, decides to help them. Laughlin is a Caucasian, and enters the tournament willingly, as does Richards. Laughlin eventually meets his end in Topeka, KS, where police burn the shed he hides in. Dan Killian (called Damon Killian in the film) is an African-American. Killian is also the producer of ""The Running Man,"" not the host. Unlike in the film, the only Hunter mentioned by name in the novel is Evan McCone, the chief Hunter, who is eventually shot dead by Richards. While in Boston, Richards escapes his pursuers by setting fire to a YMCA he is hiding in and narrowly escapes through a sewer pipe. The resulting fire kills five police officers. The ending is far more dire in the novel than in the film. In Derry, Richards carjacks a woman named Amelia Williams and makes his way to Derry\'s airport, hijacking a plane, where he also takes McCone hostage. As in the film, Richards is given the chance to become leader Hunter (much to McCone\'s chagrin) by Killian, though unlike in the film he accepts. He is later given the terrible news that both his wife and daughter had been killed even before he had even first appeared on ""The Running Man,"" giving him time to ponder the offer more. Feeling he has nothing left to lose, Richards overpowers the flight crew and kills McCone, but is mortally wounded in the process. Setting Williams free via a parachute, Richards makes a suicide run on the Games Building in New York, killing Killian and everybody inside.', u'Erland van Lidth (""Dynamo"") was a classically trained Helden baritone opera singer, so in his introduction when Dynamo is singing an aria from ""The Marriage of Figaro"", it actually is van Lidth singing.', u'""The Running Man"" suit that the contestants wear bears an Adidas logo at the hip and right arm.', u""Prior to Paul Michael Glaser being hired as director, executive producer Rob Cohen had hired four other directors in his attempts to make the movie. The first was George P. Cosmatos, who had impressed Cohen with his work on Rambo: First Blood Part II (1985). However, when Cosmatos announced that he wanted to relocate the entire film to a shopping mall, Cohen let him go, feeling that Cosmatos was taking the script in an unacceptable direction. Cohen next offered the project to German director Carl Schenkel, having been impressed with Pelon tunnit (1984), but Schenkel turned him down as he didn't feel comfortable taking on such a large project. Next, Cohen hired Ferdinand Fairfax, based upon his work on Savage Islands (1983). Like Cosmatos, however, Fairfax began to take the screenplay in a direction which Cohen disliked, so once again, he let him go. Cohen then turned to Andrew Davis, having enjoyed Davis' movie Code of Silence (1985). Davis actually got the project off the ground and into production, but only eight days into the shoot, he was already $8 million over budget and four days behind schedule. As such Cohen let Davis go, and ultimately hired Glaser, whom he had worked with on the first season of Miami Vice (1984)."", u'Arnold Schwarzenegger (trademark): ""I\'ll be back!""', u'In Killian\'s office there is a poster for a fake TV show called ""Hate Boat.""

Additionally it was reported that Jean-Claude Van Damme constantly complained about the monster suit being too hot, causing him to pass out. He also had allegedly voiced his reservations on numerous occasions regarding the fact he would not be appearing on camera without the suit. Additionally the original design for the Predator was felt to be too cumbersome and difficult to manage in the jungle and, even with a more imposing actor was felt to not provoke enough fear. Van Damme was removed from the film and replaced by Kevin Peter Hall.', u'According to an interview with Director John McTiernan, the ""hole in the jungle"" appearance of the Predator, was played by Jean-Claude Van Damme in a ""bluescreen"" (actually red) suit. Van Damme quit after two days, unhappy with being cast as an uncredited special effect, but can be seen as the Predator in If It Bleeds We Can Kill It: The Making of \'Predator\' (2001).

Stan Winston later created the Predator for 1.5 million dollars. This other studio charged half that amount. Because of that, their Predator looked like someone in a lizard suit, with the head of a duck, according to Arnold Schwarzenegger. When Winston was brought in to redesign the Predator, the final fight scene had to be re-shot. The new Predator was 8-1/2 feet tall, but the re-cast Kevin Peter Hall was 7\'2"".

This is a weapon most commonly mounted on the side of a helicopter (or an aircraft carrier) and many, many modifications had to be made to make it usable in the film. It was powered via an electrical cable hidden down the front of Blain's trousers. The firing rate was slowed down to approximately one-third the normal rate of fire, both to reduce consumption of blanks, and to make the spinning of the barrels visible on film. It is rumored that Ventura had to wear a bulletproof vest, because of the forceful ejection of spent cartridges, but this is false. Unmodified miniguns eject out of the bottom, with the cases essentially falling out, due to gravity. Close examination of the film, especially the scene in which Mac fires the minigun at the fleeing predator, along with the other commandos, show that the ejection of the minigun was not changed."", u'Peter Cullen was reluctant to take the job of voicing the Predator, as he injured his throat playing the title character of King Kong (1976), but eventually accepted, after seeing a picture of the unmasked creature.', u'Arnold Schwarzenegger recommended Jesse Ventura for Blain, after interviewing him for the role. He thought he looked the part, was big enough, had a deep voice, and was manly.', u'The famous clicking and gurgling sound, the Predator makes throughout the movie, was thought up by Peter Cullen. After the producers approached him to give the Predator ""a voice"", he was taken aback, because he had no idea what something like that was suppose to sound like, not to mention that the producers were reluctant to show what the character was finally going to look like, they relented, and Cullen, who thought the Predator creature resembled a ""horseshoe crab"", remembered as a kid, how if you turned one over, they would ""gurgle"", and that became the Predator\'s ""sound"".', u'Arnold Schwarzenegger lost over twenty-five pounds before filming began, in order to better fit the role of a special warfare operative, who would be lean, as well as muscular.', u'Shane Black hated the glasses he was given to wear as Hawkins. He wanted to wear authentic military-issue ballistic glasses, worn by actual troops in the field, but John McTiernan wanted him to look as geeky as possible.', u'The Sound Editors called the Predator\'s shoulder gun, the ""Parrot Gun"", because when it moved independent of the Predator while aiming, it reminded them of ""Peter Sellers with a rubber parrot on his shoulder.""', u'The mandibles of the Predator were the idea of James Cameron.', u'An attempt was made to get shots of the Predator swinging from tree to tree using a monkey in a red special effects suit. However, the monkey kept removing the suit, and the idea was abandoned.', u'Due to health and safety regulations, Arnold Schwarzenegger was not allowed to light his cigar inside the helicopter near the beginning of the film.

The Predator can also see if the soldiers are carrying any kind of weapons, or knives, and if they are unarmed, indicating the Predator has a different vision mode, which makes him able to detect solid metal."", u""Hawkins was originally supposed to wear a distinctive red beret, most likely inspired by the U.S. Army's maroon airborne berets, worn by American paratroopers.

He practiced different moves up to 50 times. He wound up garnering a compliment in ""Soldier of Fortune"" magazine for his realistic handling of the guns on camera (whereas the magazine usually lampoons movies for their inaccurate depictions of weapons use).', u""The beginning of production was postponed for nine months, due to Arnold Schwarzenegger's commitment to Conan the Destroyer (1984).

This involved the production crew and actors quickly arriving at a specified location, shooting the scene and leaving before the police arrived. As a result, some of the people seen in a few shots are actual everyday citizens completely unaware they\'re in a movie. This was also used for reshoots with Cameron even calling and waking Arnold Schwarzenegger once at 3am to meet him at a location already in full costume to quickly reshoot a scene. This explains why most of the film occurs at night. Cameron also used this tactic to film the very last scene where Sarah drives off into the desert. This almost backfired, however, when the police came sniffing around.', u'Arnold Schwarzenegger tried to avoid Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn as much as possible since the Terminator was trying to kill them, not form connections.', u""Arnold Schwarzenegger's famous debut line, 'I'll be back,' was originally scripted as 'I'll come back.'"", u""James Cameron's original idea was that Skynet would send two Terminators at once: one would be a cyborg, while the other would consist of liquid metal and would be able to shape-shift (the resistance would also have sent two humans, but one was to die during the time travel). Cameron realized early on that this latter effect could not be realized with the special effects at the time, so he abandoned it early on. When a completely computer-generated special effect proved to be a success in Cameron's The Abyss (1989), he revived the idea of the liquid Terminator for the sequel Terminator 2 (1991)."", u""In James Cameron's original treatment, Sarah Connor has an old figure skating injury that was fixed with a couple of surgical pins, and the Terminator cut the legs open of the first two Sarah Connors to find this identifying mark. In the novelization of the story, the pins were instead inserted into her leg after it was broken during her final fight against the Terminator. SkyNet knew Sarah had surgical pins in her leg, but not when or why she got them. The Terminator was therefore looking for a sign of an injury she had not yet sustained."", u'The future terminator who infiltrates the human camp in the dream sequence is played by Franco Columbu, who is a multiple Mr. Olympia title winner like Arnold Schwarzenegger and is a close friend of his.', u'Arnold Schwarzenegger originally wanted to play Kyle Reese.

In a deleted scene, Reese and Sarah are trying to escape the police station when they come across the wounded Traxler. He now believes their story and gives Reese his sidearm, telling him to protect Sarah."", u""James Cameron got the idea of giving Arnold Schwarzenegger even less lines in the film than Schwarzenegger's earlier film Conan the Barbarian (1982), in which Schwarzenegger only had 24 lines. In this film, Schwarzenegger has only 14 lines."", u""While filming the final shot, a police car arrived. And the scene was being shot without a permit. One of the crew members told the police that it was his son's film school project and that they had just the last shot left. It worked."", u""Sarah Connor is 18 years old in the movie. This is proven in the sequel Terminator 2 (1991) where Dr. Silberman says Sarah is 29 years old and T-1000 checks Sarah son's, John Connor's, profile which states he's 10 years old, having been born when Sarah was 19."", u'Science fiction author Harlan Ellison sued James Cameron, claiming that the film was plagiarized from the two The Outer Limits (1963) episodes that Ellison wrote, namely The Outer Limits: Soldier (1964) and The Outer Limits: Demon with a Glass Hand (1964). The concept of ""Skynet"" could also have been borrowed from an Ellison short story called ""I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream."" The suit was settled out of court and newer prints of the film acknowledge Ellison. Cameron has claimed that this settlement was forced upon him by the producers. He felt that Ellison was an opportunist making invalid claims, and wanted the case to go on trial. However, the studio told him that he would be personally responsible for financial damages in the event he lost the trial. So he had no choice but to accept the settlement, a fact that he has always resented.', u'The relationship between James Cameron and executive producer/Hemdale head John Daly deteriorated during post-production. According to Cameron, Daly and Orion executive Mike Medavoy (who recommended Arnold Schwarzenegger to Cameron) wanted the film to end right after the tanker explosion, removing the climax at the robot factory and epilogue. Orion Pictures, which co-financed the movie, wanted to be known for its quality movies (like Amadeus (1984) and Platoon (1986)), and perceived The Terminator (1984) as little more than a low budget vehicle to make some quick money. Quoting from Cameron: ""Daly said, \'The film has to end right after the tanker explosion.\' I told him straight, \'F**k you! The film isn\'t over yet.\'"" Daly would ultimately back down, a decision that led to the sudden success of the film. However, Orion\'s advertising support for the film was minimal in Cameron\'s eyes. Three weeks after the film was released, Medavoy still ignored Cameron\'s request to beef up the film\'s ad-campaign: ""They told me, when you have a dirty-down action thriller, the film can last in the box-office for about three weeks plus or so. They are treating the film like dog-s**t!"" Hemdale ultimately raised money to fund more advertisements. Reportedly, Schwarzenegger still holds a grudge towards Orion Pictures due to their lack of support.', u""The Terminator is the only character to be listed in the American Film Institute's 100 Heroes and Villains as both a villain (for The Terminator (1984) and a hero (for Terminator 2 (1991)). Al Pacino and Arnold Schwarzenegger are the only two actors to be on the list as playing a villain and a hero, but Pacino played two different characters. 13 other actors and actresses appear twice or more but either all as heroes or all as villains."", u""According to a 2008 interview with Lance Henriksen, James Cameron had no agent and was living in his car when he wrote the script for the film. Cameron had actually fired his agent because he didn't like the story idea Cameron had conceived for The Terminator (1984)."", u""The laser sight on the .45 Longslide was specially built by Laser Products Corporation (now Sure-Fire). This was in the early days of laser-aimed weapons and what was seen was actually not a complete assembly. Only the laser was mounted but the required battery pack was hidden from view. In those days the battery packs were very large, about the size of a TV remote control.

After a talk with Biehn\'s agent, the producers called Biehn back for another audition and he got the part.', u""Mel Gibson turned down the role of the Terminator, simply feeling he wasn't right for the part. After seeing the film, he praised Arnold Schwarzenegger as a much better choice."", u""Paramount was one of the studios that wanted to produce this film, but they stipulated that James Cameron could not direct it. Since this was Cameron's pet project at the time and he wanted to direct the film, he turned down their offer.

The scene involved the Terminator observing an elderly woman getting into a car and as she saw the Terminator she panicked and put it into reverse hitting a trash can then correcting herself put it into drive and sped off. The Terminator then enters the car, puts it into reverse then into drive mimicking the woman's actions. This was cut from a later script."", u'The movie was released in the late 1980s in Poland under the title ""The Electronic Murderer"". The title was changed because there is a Polish word \'terminator\', meaning roughly \'an apprentice\', and so the title was changed to something more catchy and interesting to audience. By the time Terminator 2 (1991) was released, the original movie was widely available on pirate copies under its original title, and because of it in the early 90s in Poland the word \'terminator\' was widely recognized as the character played by Arnold Schwarzenegger instead of its original meaning, so all the sequels had their titles unaltered.', u'The crew made T-shirts saying, ""You can\'t scare me, I work for James Cameron.""', u""During the final chase, as Reese tosses pipe bombs at the Terminator, there is a single white frame spliced in just before some of the explosions, which is a trick employed by editor Mark Goldblatt. Director James Cameron would later use this trick to heighten the visual impact of gunshots in Aliens (1986). The pyrotechnic charges can be seen on the street, each with a pressure-sensitive strip for triggering the explosion when run over by either the Terminator's motorcycle or the heroes' truck."", u'In the film, the name of the night club where the Terminator first targets Sarah was named Tech Noir after a film genre which James Cameron coined himself in describing what category this film falls under after dismissing the notions that it was a mere horror or slasher film. Tech Noir films like Blade Runner (1982) and The Terminator (1984) combine the old style grittiness of noir films with the futuristic elements of a sci-fi thriller. Cameron himself had the club built specifically for the film and had to turn away local club goers who thought Tech Noir was a real night club. The building still exists but is now a jewelry store.', u'James Cameron cited The Road Warrior (1981) as one of his influences behind ""The Terminator"".', u'Arnold Schwarzenegger\'s iconic catchphrase almost became ""I will be back"" because he thought it sounded more machine-like without a contraction; he also felt ""I\'ll"" sounded too feminine. It was the one major disagreement between Schwarzenegger and James Cameron, and all Cameron had to say to that was ""I don\'t tell you how to act, so don\'t tell me how to write"".', u""The Terminator endoskeleton was very heavy and hard for Stan Winston's team to carry. They found out that building a prop robot out of metal is realistic, but not practical."", u'Jennifer Jason Leigh was considered for the role of Sarah Connor, but director James Cameron feared she was too young for the part. She was later recast as Ginger but she was replaced at the last minute with Bess Motta.', u""The scene where the Terminator breaks into a station wagon was the very last thing shot and it was added a few weeks before the film's release. The scene was filmed in 2 hours by James Cameron and Arnold Schwarzenegger alone. Due to insufficient funds, Cameron had to pay for the scene himself, but could not afford a police permit. As such, another set of Arnold's clothes was placed behind the wagon trunk and Cameron told him to change the moment the scene was deemed finished."", u""A hydraulic arm was used when the Terminator punches through the windshield in the alley scene. This was rehearsed several times and since Arnold Schwarzenegger's face was in the shot too, it all had to be choreographed perfectly, since replacing a windshield was too costly and time consuming."", u""The original treatment by James Cameron included the detail that the Terminator needed to eat periodically in order for his human flesh to survive. A scene is included where the Terminator eats a candy bar, wrapper and all. This detail was incorporated into the script for Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003), with the Terminator selecting Arnold Schwarzenegger's favorite Austrian chocolate wafer. When fans learned that a scene had been shot where the Terminator ate chocolate, the reaction was overwhelmingly negative and the scene was omitted."", u""The Terminator's motorcycle was later displayed in Arnold Schwarzenegger's restaurant Planet Hollywood."", u""Sylvester Stallone was considered for The Terminator. Coincidentally, a year after, James Cameron and Stallone wrote Rambo: First Blood Part II (1985) together. Also, there was a competition between Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger's success in action movies about who would win in a battle: Rambo or the Terminator. Stallone later worked with Arnold on the Expendables movies and Escape Plan (2013). In Last Action Hero (1993), a scene features a video store cardboard cut-out of Stallone as the Terminator."", u""There was minimal interference from the film's financial backer, Orion, partly due to the budget offered. However, they suggested two things. The first was a cyborg canine that accompanies Reese - an idea turned down by James Cameron; the second was strengthening the relationship between Kyle and Sarah, which Cameron decided to accept."", u'In the scene where The Terminator attacks Sarah in the police station, the cop states that there are ""Thirty police officers"" in the station. If you count the cops that The Terminator kills on screen and the burst fire that he shoots for off screen kills, it adds up to thirty.', u'The ""fog"" in the scene after Sarah and Reese leave the bridge where they spent the night is actually bug spray, due to the big ""fly scare"" in the filming location at that time. The crew was going to wait until the spray dissipated, but decided to use it as fog for the effect instead. This is revealed in a DVD easter egg, which can be found by pressing the right arrow in the languages section until the square on the right is lit up.', u'Though it is now considered a Sci-fi classic, this film was originally conceived and written as a horror movie. If you strip away the robots and time travel plot, it is very similar to a Slasher picture, and borrows many of the genre\'s tropes. The Terminator is the movie\'s ""Unstoppable Killer,"" who stalks an innocent woman, killing all of her loved ones until he is in turn killed off in a creative way. Sarah Connor is the movie\'s ""Final Girl,"" who is strong enough to outsmart the killer and the only one to make it out alive.     The end of the film also employs many of the Slasher genre\'s techniques and scare tactics. A final showdown in an isolated place where no one can help, crawling through tight, cramped, and dangerous spaces to escape, and the killer comes back for a ""final scare"" multiple times.     That being said, in following these Slasher movie tropes, that makes the Terminator one of the few ""Unstoppable Killers"" of the genre to use firearms as his main weapon, and makes Sarah Connor one of the few ""Final Girls"" of the genre to have sex in the picture and make it out alive.', u'Hand-held cameras were used for much of the action. This helped give ""an energy to the scene that you can\'t get any other way"", said cinematographer Adam Greenberg.', u'The only time in the ""Terminator"" franchise when The Terminator changes his hairstyle in the film. When The Terminator breaks into an apartment in the self-repair sequences, his hairstyle is different to the one he had earlier on in the film.    This is because he runs through a fire caused by a car explosion where his hair is burned. He also loses his eyebrows, and spends the rest of the movie without them.', u'Contrary to popular belief Lance Henriksen was never going to be The Terminator. He helped Writer/director James Cameron pitch the idea to the producers. Cameron did make early sketches showing The Terminator looking like Henriksen. Lance got dressed up in some leathers, added a cut on his head and put gold foil on his teeth before kicking in the door to the Producers office 15 minutes before the meeting. He sat there staring at them, making them uncomfortable, until Cameron got there. Then Lance just left. Lance never thought he was ever going to be the Terminator.

James Cameron also shot the carjacking scene without a permit.

His vision was of a metal endoskeleton emerging from flames and most of the script was written backwards from there. The endoskeleton would have to be futuristic, and Cameron couldn't afford to set the film in the future. The solution was to bring the future to the present, hence the 'time travel' aspect of the script was written in."", u'Michael Biehn and Arnold Schwarzenegger are in the same frame together only once. It is when Kyle blasts The Terminator the second time at Tech Noir. When they finally meet in the factory, it is not Schwarzenegger, just a metallic puppet.', u'Kyle Reese smiles only once during the entire movie, when Sarah makes to playfully throw the bag of dynamite at him after their night of intimacy.', u""Please note -- also a spoiler for Terminator 2 (1991)) Two deleted scenes gave Skynet and the Future War some more background. The first was a scene where Sarah discovers that a company called Cyberdyne will be responsible for building Skynet and the Terminators. She tries to convince Reese that they should destroy this company, in order to prevent the dark future from ever happening. Reese tells her that his mission is conserving the future, not changing it. The second scene shows that Cyberdyne owns the factory where Sarah battled the Terminator, and one of their employees finding the Terminator's microchip (this event actually causes Skynet to exist in the first place). Both these ideas became major plot points for the sequel Terminator 2 (1991). Director James Cameron cut the scenes because he wanted to leave some questions yet unanswered, which he never regretted as he could make an entire sequel out of the unused ideas."", u""The Terminator kills a total of 28 people: the punk, the gun store owner, the first two Sarah Connors, Matt and Ginger, three Tech Noir patrons, 17 police officers (not fully established until the sequel), Sarah's mother and the truck driver (although he may have only knocked him out). Kyle Reese doesn't count: even though the Terminator wounds and roughs him up, Reese eventually dies from the explosive impact of his own bomb."", u'The body bag Reese is put in at the end of the film is actually a suit bag owned by director James Cameron.', u""Arnold Schwarzenegger's voice is used in exactly 16 lines, with 17 sentences spoken. The terminator has two other lines on-screen, one with the voice of a police officer overdubbed, and one with the voice of Sarah's mother overdubbed. There are also many lines with the voice of Sarah's mother, and we learn that the terminator is actually saying them, but we don't see it."", u""Filming of the final shot, with Sarah Connor driving off into the distance, was interrupted by a policeman asking if the crew had a permit (which they didn't). Special effects supervisor Gene Warren Jr. lied that the production was his son's student film. Also, Sarah Connor wasn't being played by Linda Hamilton but by a double."", u'The smoke flowing out of The Terminator when it is crushed in the hydraulic press is actually cigarette smoke.', u'The soundtrack features a song called Pictures Of You by Jay Ferguson. It\'s one of the songs Ginger listens to during the movie. Although the song has nothing to do with the plot of the movie and was not written for the movie specifically, its chorus ""Pictures of you, From another time and place. Pictures of you, Like a scene in a photograph I can\'t erase. Pictures of you, Ooh, on a screen that fades without a trace."" sounds like the song is alluding to the photograph of Sarah Connor that Reese had.', u'Series Trademark: In the first three Terminator films, the villainous Terminator\'s death is greeted with the word ""Terminated"" in some way: Sarah Connor says ""You\'re terminated fucker"" as she crushes the Terminator in the hydraulic press; in Terminator 2 (1991), when John asks ""Is it dead?"", Terminator responds with ""Terminated""; in Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003), Terminator holds down the T-X and says ""You are terminated!"".', u""After the Terminator is run over by the tanker truck, he's limping. Then his 'skin' is burned off cleanly in the fuel fire. Later, in the factory, when the Terminator is chasing Sarah and Kyle, he's climbing metal stairs and there are two quick shots of his feet. If you look closely, you can see the cause of his limp: there is an actuator connector to his left 'heel' which is hanging free, as compared to his right foot where the actuator is still connected. So essentially, the actuator acting as the Terminator's Achilles' tendon has been severed, resulting in the limp."", u""Estimated body count: 39. One of the three punks (Brian Thompson) dies when punched through the stomach; it is assumed that the punk leader (Bill Paxton) only got knocked out and the third (Brad Rearden) merely lost his clothes. The gun store clerk and the first two Sarah Connors are next. During Reese's first flashback memory, two soldiers are killed in action (a female soldier hit by a laser, and a male on the back of the pick-up). Sarah's friend Ginger and her boyfriend Matt are killed by the Terminator. Three people die in the Tech Noir shoot-out (two are seen being hit, a third can be seen lying next to Sarah as she falls). The cop whose car is stolen by Terminator probably survives. Lt. Traxler mentions to Sarah that there are 30 police officers in the station, but if information from the sequel Terminator 2 (1991) is considered, then 17 died during the police station shoot-out. In Reese's second flashback memory, 8 people can be see to be shot. Also presumably killed are Sarah's mother and the truck driver (although he may have just been knocked unconscious), and finally Kyle Reese. If the Terminator himself and the two German Shepherd dogs from Reese's second flashback are counted, it amounts to a total of 42."", u'In the film\'s final cut, there\'s a scene where Sarah screams ""No!"" twice, upon seeing that the Terminator is still alive. These vocals were actually taken from a deleted scene where Reese struggles with Sarah.', u'Arnold Schwarzenegger had his eyebrows insured at Lloyds of London as he feared that they might not grow back properly after he shaved them for the scene where he runs over a car on fire in the alley after the Tech Noir shootout.', u""After the Terminator is run over by the tanker truck, his 'skin' is subsequently burned off cleanly in the fuel fire.     This is theoretically possible if you consider the principle of a self-cleaning oven (SCO). The typical SCO is heated to an internal temperature in excess of 800 degrees Fahrenheit and is maintained there for hours. At the end of the process, any organic residue is reduced to grey ash which can be wiped off with a rag.     The body of the Terminator was in the fuel truck fire for only a short time, but the fire was likely burning at temperatures well in excess of 1000 degrees F. This could have been enough to leave a clean metal endoskeleton with no charred flesh on it."", u'This film, Terminator 2 (1991), and Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003) have shown Terminators to be anatomically correct.', u""The only Terminator film to have frontal female nudity.

After the phenomenon of E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982), Universal thought Conan the Destroyer (1984) would make more money if it were family entertainment. Schwarzenegger argued against this change but they overruled him. Director Richard Fleischer agreed with Schwarzenegger, but complied with Universal's wishes to make Conan the Destroyer (1984) more like a comic book. Although it out-grossed Conan the Barbarian (1982), it didn't do as well in the US, because it was more family-friendly, just as Schwarzenegger and Fleischer feared.

Subotai (or Subedei Baghadur) was the name of Great Khan\'s general. The fact that Conan is not only chased but to some extent orphaned by dogs also recalls Genghis Khan\'s well-documented fear of that particular animal.

The story is that the Mattel Toy Company started to make some Conan action figures, but after viewing the film, the executives realized that they couldn\'t afford to be associated with a film with such graphic sex and violence. They gave their doll blonde hair, called him ""He-man"", and thus created He-Man and the Masters of the Universe (1983). However, since the first He-Man figures were released in 1981, the legend appears to be false. In 1984, however, now-defunct toy company Remco released an officially licensed series of Conan action figures. Ironically enough, once the He-Man action figures became immensely popular, numerous knockoffs were produced, including a repainted He-Man figure that had brown hair, making it look like Arnold Schwarzenegger.

The character Thulsa Doom is both named after and partly based on an enemy of Kull and not of Conan.

The censors asked John Milius to tone the violence down which he did, but in the end it still wasn't enough for them.

The Cimmerians were ""tall and powerful, with dark hair and blue or grey eyes"".', u'The Conan stories were rediscovered and reprinted in the 1950s. Their popularity has waxed and waned over time, but most remain in print. Conan fandom is divided among ""purists"" who only appreciate the original stories and unfinished drafts by Robert E.

When he lost interest in that production, he read the Conan script and agreed to take the part of the villain.', u'Basil Poledouris made extensive use of Musync, a music and tempo editing hardware and software system which modified the tempo of his compositions and synchronized them with the action in the film. Conan was the first film to use the system.', u""Real arrows were shot into the snake, right over Arnold Schwarzenegger's head. John Milius shot them himself after it was determined he was the best archer in the crew."", u""Crom, Conan's deity, is not an original creation of Robert E. Howard. His notes included referenced to an entire pantheon of Cimmerian deities, all based on deities and other figures from Celtic mythologies. He is named after Crom Cruach, a god of Ireland whose worship supposedly included human sacrifice."", u'Besides the literary series of Conan stories, the film was influenced by the Marvel Comics popular adaptations and expansion of it: ""Conan the Barbarian"" (1970-1993) and ""Savage Sword of Conan"" (1974-1995) which featured the works of writers and artists such as Roy Thomas and Barry Windsor-Smith.', u'Thulsa Doom in the film briefly shape-shifts into a snake. This is probably inspired by the Serpent Men, a shape-shifting, humanoid-snake race in the works of Robert E. Howard and their adaptations. They figure prominently in both the Kull the Conqueror and Conan stories.', u'Gerry Lopez who played Subotai was a champion surfer but had little acting experience. His only notable previous film role was playing himself in the film Big Wednesday (1978), also directed by John Milius.', u'Sandahl Bergman was a professional dancer whose few previous film roles were in dance-related films. She was recommended for the role by director Bob Fosse who have worked with her in All That Jazz (1979).', u'A limitation for Arnold Schwarzenegger was his heavy Austrian accent which was included in certain scenes of the film. He had to take extensive voice coach training to learn to control.', u""The usual practice of the film industry is to hire a composer following the completion of filming of the main scenes. Basil Poledouris was instead hired for Conan before the filming started. He was able to compose the film's music based on the initial storyboards and to modify it throughout filming, before recording the score near the end of production."", u'Certain scenes of the film have been noted for using a pattern, introducing a literal or symbolic concept of death, followed by a journey into the underworld, and then a rebirth. This is a common element in many myths and fictional tales. While this and the crucifixion scene have reminded some scholars of Christian imagery, John Milius himself pointed that the film is full of pagan ideas.', u'Arnold Schwarzenegger called Max von Sydow the first ""incredible dramatic actor"" he ever worked with. He finds von Sydow\'s performance ""staggering.""', u""Arnold Schwarzenegger's first time filming a Hollywood Film in a foreign country; he picked up a lot of Spanish because few people on-set spoke English. He enjoyed some sightseeing while he was there."", u'The Hyborian Age includes many kingdoms and tribes conceived as ancestral to historical ones. As explained by Robert E. Howard: 1) Pure-blooded Aesir were ancestors of the Achaeans, Britons, and Gauls, 2) An Aesir off-shoot which conquered the kingdom of Nemedia formed the ancestors of the Nemedians of Irish legend, 3) Pure-blooded Vanir were the ancestors of the Danes, 4) a mixed race formed from the interbreeding of the Aesir, Cimmerians, and Vanir were the ancestors of the Goths and through them of the other Scandinavian and Germanic tribes, including the Anglo-Saxons, 5) Pure-blooded Cimmerians were the ancestors of the Gaels and through them of the Irish and the Highland Scots, 6) a mixed race formed from the interbreeding of Cimmerians and Nordics were the ancestors of the Cymric tribes (the Welsh people), of the Cimbri (in Roman history), of the Gimmerai (in Assyrian history), of the historical Cimmerians (in Greek history), and the Gomer (in Hebrew history), 7) a mixed race formed from the interbreeding of the Cimmerians and the Hyrkanians were the ancestors of the Scythians, 8) a mixed race formed from the interbreeding of the Hyrkanians and the Shemites were the ancestors of the Sumerians, 9) The Shemites, both pure-blooded and those interbreeding with Hyborians and Nordics, were the ancestors of the historic Semitic people (Arabs, Israelites, and others), 10) A mixed race formed from the interbreeding of the Shemites and Kushites were the ancestors of the Canaanites and the Elamites, 11) A mixed race formed from the interbreeding of the Hyrcanians, Picts, and Stygians were the ancestors of the Etruscans and though them of the Romans, and 12) Pure-blooded Hyrcanians were the ancestors of the Huns, Mongols, Tatars, and Turks.', u'Conan as a character is considered influenced by existentialism, despite his creation before the heyday of this philosophy. He ""defines his own purpose and shapes his own destiny. Conan does not have a noble destiny; in contrast to much fantasy fiction, he is not of noble birth, he is not fulfilling any prophecy, he is not the ""chosen one"" of any gods or powers that be. When Conan ultimately becomes King of Aquilonia, he is not preordained to do so by fate nor is he the legitimate heir; he seizes an opportunity to make himself king. Conan is the consummate self-determining man.""', u""Conan's mother was played by Nadiuska. She is a German actress (of Polish and Russian descent) who made a notable film career in Spain. Her only previous role in an English-language film was the exploitation film Guyana: Cult of the Damned (1979)."", u'The painting of symbols on Conan\'s body and the swarm of ghosts during the barbarian\'s resurrection did not derive from Conan tales. They were inspired by the Japanese horror film Kwaidan (1964), a collection of ghost tales. The scenes are primarily based on the film\'s depiction of ""Hoichi the Earless"", a traditional tale abound a blind musician who is asked to entertain ghosts.', u""There were few optical effects used on the film, as John Milius felt that overly depending on depictions of the supernatural would ruin the film. Among the effects used were adding glint and sparkle to The Eye of the Serpent and Valeria's Valkyrie armor, and the depiction of ghosts. Most optical effects were created by Visual Concepts Engineering (VCE), while the ghost scene was a co-operation between the VCE and Industrial Light and Magic."", u'The DVD commentary promises a third movie a few times, but the third movie was shelved entirely.', u""The Cimmerians of the Hyborian Age, Conan's tribe, are named after a historic tribe of that name. They first appear in the historical record c. 714 BC. In that year they assisted Sargon II, King of Assyria (reigned 722 - 705 BC) in his victory against the kingdom of Urartu. In 705 BC, they fought against Sargon himself and killed him in battle. In 696-695 BC, they are recorded as migrating to Anatolia, invading and conquering Phrygia and destroying the capital Gordium. In 679 BC, they invaded Cilicia and Tabal but were defeated by Esarhaddon, King of Assyria (reigned 681-669 BC). In c. 654 BC, they invaded Lydia, killed its king Gyges and damaged the capital Sardis. In the 640s BC, they invaded Lydia again and sacked Sardis. They also raided the Greek cities of Ionia. They were eventually defeated by Alyattes, King of Lydia (reigned 619-560 BC), and they disappear from the historical record. It is thought possible that they migrated to Cappadocia. Several later tribes have been suggested as their descendants due to name similarities, though no evidence seems to confirm it."", u'Robert E. Howard conceived of Cimmeria, Conan\'s homeland, prior to creating the character himself. In February, 1932, Howard wrote the poem Cimmeria, about a ""land of Darkness and deep Night"", a gloomy place with dark woods, dusky silent streams and a leaden cloudy sky.', u'The Temple of Set was built on the mountains to the west of the city of Almeria. Built out of various woods, lacquers, and tons of concrete. Its stairway had 120 steps.', u""The scene with the vultures at the Tree of Woe made use of both real birds and a fake one. The real ones were placed in the branches of the tree, while the one Conan bites was mechanical. The dummy bird's feathers and wings were from a dead vulture, and its control mechanisms were routed inside the false tree."", u""The film's depiction of violence polarized fans and critics in the 1980s. Some felt that the film was too violent and included too many deaths. Others felt that some of the violent scenes were exciting but not all were well-executed. Finally others, including those familiar with the original Conan stories, claimed that the film overly toned down the violence and gore, making the depiction cartoon-like."", u'The sword\'s inscription reads, ""Suffer no guilt, ye who wield this in the name of Crom.""

Howard: ""The Hour of the Dragon"". All other Conan tales were either short stories or poems. Several pastiche writers chose to write novels instead of short stories. By 1982, Conan had appeared in several novels.', u'Valeria as depicted in the film has been described as an Amazon character, a female warrior whose battle prowess matches that of Conan, serves as his equal in behavior and status, and is bound to him by loyalty and love.', u'Sean Connery was considered for the role of Thulsa Doom.', u'The artist most associated with Conan is likely Frank Frazetta whose covers redefined the visual appearance of Conan and influenced many subsequent artists.', u'The brief scene with an older Conan sitting on the throne of Aquilonia was filmed in 1980, prior to most of the other filming. This footage was initially intended to be a trailer but John Milius decided to use it as the opening sequence of the film. Following concerns from the producers, the scene was moved to the end of the film.', u""The scene in which Valeria and Subotai fought off ghosts to save Conan and the final battle with Doom's forces were filmed in the salt marshes of Almerimar. To improve the scenes, certain alterations were performed in the local landscape, such as the construction of Stonehenge-like ruins. This attracted the protests of environmentalists."", u'The use of live animals in the film was controversial. The American Humane Association, the overseeing organization for humane treatment of animals on the sets of Hollywood films, noted that there were incidents such as a dog being kicked, a camel striked, and horses tripped. So animals were in fact harmed.', u'John Milius and Basil Poledouris worked together during the production to determine the themes and ""emotional tones"" for each scene. Milius\' original concept for the film and its music reportedly involved an opera with little or no dialog. Poledouris composed enough musical pieces to cover most of the film.', u""Max von Sydow did this movie for his son, who's a longtime Conan fan."", u'Arnold Schwarzenegger calls the movie ""God\'s gift to [his] career.""', u'While Conan and other barbarian characters were not the only creations of Robert E. Howard, he seemed to prefer them over more ""civilized"" characters. The writer propagated the view that human civilization is unnatural, inherently corrupt, and fragile. One of the Conan tales summarizes his views on the subject: ""Barbarism is the natural state of mankind. Civilization is unnatural. It is a whim of circumstance. And barbarism must always ultimately triumph.""', u'Race and racial traits of both barbarian and civilized tribes and kingdoms played a prominent part in the original Conan tales. They formed the basis of characterization as well. While often considered racist in attitude, Robert E. Howard at times included sympathetic black and Jewish characters in his work. Both were at the time considered undesirable minority groups in the United States.', u'Another of Robert E. Howard\'s personal beliefs that influenced the Conan stories was his placing of supreme value on individuality and individual liberty above the restrains of laws and customs. According to one of his writings on the subject: ""I\'d rather be a naked savage, shivering, starving, freezing, hunted by wild beasts and enemies, but free to go and come, with the range of the earth to roam, than the fattest, richest, most bedecked slave in a golden palace with the crustal fountains, silken divans, and ivory-bosomed dancing girls of Haroun al Raschid.""', u'Robert E. Howard\'s Conan tales are thought influenced by pre-existing philosophies and literary schools: Romanticism, Neo-romanticism, Aestheticism, and the Decadent movement. They influenced such story elements as a disdain for reason, tradition, and any form of tyranny, a love of beauty, color, and pageantry in the descriptions of anything from battlefields to decadent cities, themes of wanderlust, black magic, accursed jewels, and snake figures, and also Conan\'s personal philosophy: ""Let me live deep while I live; let me know the rich juices of red meat and stinging wine on my palate, the hot embrace of white arms, the mad exultation of battle when the blue blades flame and crimson, and I am content... I live, I burn with life, I love, I slay, and am content.""', u'While Conan is chiefly remembered for his strength and fighting skills, the character was not created as dumb muscle. Stories where Conan is cast in a leadership position tend to depict him as a talented commander, tactician, and strategist. His creator also depicted him as having reading and writing skills and a talent for learning languages during his many travels. According to one of his stories: ""In his roaming about the world the giant adventurer had picked up a wide smattering of knowledge, particularly including the speaking and reading of many alien tongues. Many a sheltered scholar would have been astonished at the Cimmerian\'s linguistic abilities.""', u'An important plot point in several of his stories is the contrast between Conan as a barbarian and rogue with the more civilized or sophisticated people of the tales. He tends to appear significantly more honest or honorable than them. For example in ""Rogues in the House"" (1934), Conan is contrasted with two corrupt politicians. One of them admits, ""This Cimmerian is the most honest man of the three of us, because he steals and murders openly."" In ""Shadows in the Moonlight"" (1934), Conan is surprised to learn that a female slave was sold by her own father as punishment for disobeying him. He admits that the Cimmerians are barbarians but ""We do not sell our children"".', u'According to John Milius, his primary influences for the depiction of the Serpent cult and its assassination plans were the Hashshashin (Assassins) and the Thuggee (Thugs).', u""The final battle against Thulsa Doom's men was inspired by Seven Samurai (1954)."", u'The first series character by Robert E. Howard was Kull the Conqueror, created in 1929. Howard wrote 12 short stories about Kull and one poem. However, he only managed to sell three of them to his publisher. Conan was conceived as a replacement character. The Kull story ""By This Axe I Rule!"" was re-worked into ""The Phoenix on the Sword"", the first appearance of Conan.', u'Robert E. Howard envisioned the Cimmerians (and Conan) as proto-Celts. The name Conan is also Celtic and appears in both history and legend. The Celt Conan Meriadoc supposedly founded Brittany in the late 4th or early 5th century. His tale appeared frequently in Medieval Sources and several later Dukes of Brittany bore his name.', u'The characterization of the civilized kingdoms of the Hyborian Age was influenced by creator Robert E. Howard\'s own views on progress and civilization. They are wealthy and developed, but frequently lawless and mostly corrupt. His personal view of history includes ""a repeating pattern of civilizations reaching their peak, becoming decadent, decaying and then being conquered by another people."" The setting of his work tends to be in either the period of decline of an entire civilization or in the ruins it left behind following its demise.', u'Those supporting a connection between the Conan franchise and the Masters of the Universe point to the similarities between Thulsa Doom and Skeletor. Thulsa Doom as described by creator Robert E. Howard has a skull-face and his depictions in art tend to have his head as only a human skull. Skeletor, archenemy of He-Man was depicted in the 1980s as ""a muscular blue humanoid with a purple hood over his yellowing bare-bone skull"". Both characters were also powerful sorcerers.', u""The script by Oliver Stone included the raid on the Cimmerian village. It was one of the few elements of that script which John Milius chose to keep, expand, and to provide follow up to. He followed the scene with with the barbarian's enslavement at the Wheel of Pain and training as a gladiator."", u""Martial arts training and sword training for Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sandahl Bergman, and Gerry Lopez was performed by expert Kiyoshi Yamazaki. He also assisted in the choreography of the sword fights. Yamazaki had a cameo in the film as one of Conan's instructors."", u""While expensive to create, the primary swords created for the film proved heavy, unbalanced, and unsuitable for actual combat. They were mostly used in close-up shots. For the fight scenes, they used lighter versions made of aluminum, fiberglass, and steel. The other weapons used in the film were not as elaborate; Valeria's talwar was ground out from an aluminum sheet."", u'The talwar sword used by Valeria, a curved sword or sabre, was not a typical choice for American films. It is a sword design from the Indian subcontinent and primarily associated with the Mughal Empire. The design is thought to have influenced the Pattern 1796 light cavalry sabre used by the British during the Napoleonic Wars.', u""In an attempt to minimise injuries, certain fight scenes and depictions of killing blows made use of trick swords. They were made out of fibreglass, had retractable blades and some of them sprayed blood from their tips. Accidents still happened in scenes involving them, however. In one scene an extra used a trick sword to slice open Sandahl Bergman's finger."", u'Thulsa Doom\'s onscreen transformation into a giant snake was one of the most elaborate special effects in the film. It involved ""fake body parts, live and dummy snakes, miniatures, and other camera tricks combined into a flowing sequence with lap dissolve. After James Earl Jones was filmed in position, he was replaced by a hollow framework with a rubber mask that was pushed from behind by a snake head-shaped puppet to give the illusion of Doom\'s facial bones changing. The head was then replaced with a 6 feet (1.8 m) mechanical snake; as it moved outwards, a crew member pressed a foot pedal to collapse the framework. For the final part of the sequence, a real snake was filmed on a miniature set.""', u'John Milius initially wanted to have Thulsa Doom\'s introductory scene use either parts of the cantata ""Carmina Burana"" (1937) by Carl Orff (1895-1982), or music patterned after it. He changed his mind when he learned that ""Carmina Burana"" had already been used for the music score of Excalibur (1981).', u'Basil Poledouris\' music theme for Thulsa Doom included energetic choral passages, sung in the Latin language. The lyrics were composed in English and where then roughly translated. The Latin words where chosen primarily for the way they sounded, and do not always make sense. The melody of the theme was based on ""Dies Irae"" (Day of Wrath), a Latin hymn of the 13th century whose authorship is disputed. The hymn is known both for being part of the Requiem Mass of the Roman Catholic Church and being frequently quoted by composers.', u'The film connections with opera are not limited to dialogue and and costumes. The opening sequence involves a sword forging scene, the hero witnesses his parents\' deaths, grows up as a slave, and slays a giant serpent-dragon. These are all in common with the story of the protagonist in the opera Siegfried (1876) by Richard Wagner, the third part of ""Der Ring des Nibelungen (The Ring of the Nibelung)"". The opera was in turn based on the character Sigurd/Siegfried in Norse mythology, the slayer of Fafnir the dragon.', u'The brief use of the writings of Friedrich Nietzsche (1844-1900) in the film has led certain scholars and reviewers to claim that the tale borrows from his concept of the ""\xdcbermensch"" (Superman, Superhuman), introduced in ""Thus Spoke Zarathustra"" (1883-1891).', u'Arnold Schwarzenegger kept the snake dagger as a memento. He still has it.', u'Stunt coordinator Terry Leonard broke his leg doing a fall. According to Arnold Schwarzenegger, Leonard was trying to impress Sandahl Bergman. Sure enough, they started dating afterward.', u'Arnold Schwarzenegger asked Sandahl Bergman to be careful jumping on him. ""I\'m very exposed here!"" he said.', u'The snake trainer\'s assistants were all beautiful girls, which made John Milius say, ""He was sort of like Thulsa Doom.""', u'Conan the Cimmerian is actually the second character by Robert E. Howard to use that name. Already in 1931, Howard used the name ""Conan"" for a Gael reaver in an unrelated story. The earlier Conan also swore by the name of Crom.', u'While Conan was a womanizing character with many lovers, his creator Robert E. Howard actually had little experience with romance. His only known girlfriend was fellow writer Novalyne Price Ellis. Their relationship was the basis of the film ""The Whole Wide World"" (1996).', u'Another influence on Robert E. Howard were the writings and theories of Helena Blavatsky and William Scott-Elliot on ""lost civilizations, ancient wisdom, races, magic and sunken continents and the lands of Lemuria, Atlantis and Hyperborea"" which are present in either the Kull or the Conan stories.', u'Stygia and its culture in the Hyborian Age are a fantasy counterpart to Ancient Egypt, with deities and names based on ancient Egypt. The chief deity Set himself is based on two deities of Egyptian mythology. The name is based on the god Set/Seth, chiefly associated with the desert, storms, disorder, violence and foreigners. He had an animal form but not associated with any particular animal, though late depictions portray him with a donkey head. The giant serpent form of Hyborian Set is instead based on Apep/Apophis, a serpent god representing Chaos and ""personification of all that was evil"". Though Seth and Apep were originally depicted as enemies in Egyptian legend they were later identified with each other, probably influencing their conflation by Howard. The Ancient Greeks identified the evil Seth with Typhon, an enemy of their gods. Similar counterparts of Set/Seth and archenemies of the gods appear in several ancient mythologies and there are theories that they legends could have common origins.', u""Aquilonia in the Conan tales is depicted as the most powerful of the Hyborian kingdoms, kingdoms created by the Hyborian tribes. It is also among the most powerful kingdoms in the entire series, alongside the eastern empires of Turan and Vendhya. According to Howard's essay on the Hyborian Age, the Aquilonians following the death of Conan would create their own expansionist empire. They would eventually be conquered themselves by the barbarian empire of the Picts."", u""While named after Thulsa Doom, the film character has many similarities with an actual Conan enemy: Thoth-Amon, a Stygian sorcerer and priest of Set. He first appeared alongside Conan in his first appearance. They never met in person in the Robert E. Howard stories, but Thoth-Amon's plots ended up involving Conan."", u'Thulsa Doom has no proper origin story in any of his incarnations in the media. Despite his association with the realms of Atlantis and Valusia in the Kull the Conqueror tales, he briefly claims to have experienced his first death before Atlantis first rose from the sea.', u'Among the missing elements in the Conan origin presented in the film is teenaged Conan\'s first battle: the Battle of Venarium. According to the printed works on Conan, Venarium was an Aquilonian frontier fort built in Cimmerian territory. It was an attempt by civilized Aquilonia to colonize Cimmeria. The Cimmerian clans united to attack it, with a 15-year-old Conan among them. In summary: ""Conan joined the howling, blood-mad horde that swept out of the northern hills, stormed over the stockade walls, and drove the Aquilonians back across their frontier.""', u'The city of Arenjun in Zamora, the ""City of Thieves"", and Conan\'s career as a professional thief are based on the short story ""The Tower of the Elephant"" (1933) by Robert E. Howard. This story features Conan\'s chronologically earliest adventure in a civilized kingdom. Arenjun has proved a popular setting for pastiche works and adaptations. The idea of Conan as a thief did not sell well in Howard\'s time, but has been revisited by many later writers. The other prominent city of Zamora, Shadizar, has also featured prominently in stories by other writers.', u'In his introduction of Conan, creator Robert E. Howard described him as ""black-haired, sullen-eyed, sword in hand, a thief, a reaver, a slayer, with gigantic melancholies and gigantic mirth"".', u""The many roles of Conan in the film (slave, pit fighter, thief, mercenary) are consistent with his depiction in any media. Robert E. Howard portrayed the character as a wandering adventure whose profession, level of wealth, and other circumstances largely depended on a story's specific location and its overall placement in Conan's personal timeline. Stories variously featured him as a thief, an outlaw, a mercenary, a pirate, a tribal chieftain, a general, and a king. Other writers have followed this example and portrayed him in these and any other line of work, according to their preferences. This allows the franchise to include elements spanning several genres, from war stories and pirate tales to political fiction and crime fiction."", u'The morality of Conan in any media tends to vary widely. Depending on the story, his motivation includes self-preservation, personal gain, revenge, and protectiveness towards specific people or entire groups. He regularly performs heroic deeds but his causes are not always noble or selfless. He can be seen as antihero who simply tends to face opponents more villainous in nature than himself.', u'Among the deviations of the film from the literary depiction of Conan was that this Conan was ""less powerful, less talkative, and less educated"".', u""CASTLE THUNDER: Heard during the scene when the spirits try to take Conan's body away."", u'Conan is a Cimmerian. In the essay ""The Hyborian Age"", which fleshed out Conan\'s world and established its history, Robert E. Howard established his Cimmerians as descendants of the Atlanteans and ancestors of the Gaels. He specified that the Gaels descended from ""pure-blooded Cimmerian clans"" and were themselves ancestors of the Irish people and the Highland Scots. This was partly based on Howard\'s own fascination with the historical Celts.', u'While Robert E. Howard remains the best known Conan writer, he only wrote Conan stories from 1932 to 1936. He then committed suicide, leaving behind several unfinished story drafts. Several of these were completed by other authors and all Conan material following the 1930s has been written by other writers. Among the better known ones are L. Sprague de Camp and Lin Carter.', u'Arnold Schwarzenegger was reportedly chosen for the role of Conan after the producers viewed a rough cut of his bodybuilding film Pumping Iron (1977).', u'When filming started, James Earl Jones had to co-ordinate his schedule with the film crew. At the time he was also starring in ""Lesson to Aloes"", a Broadway play.', u'James Earl Jones provided Arnold Schwarzenegger with pointers on how to deliver his lines.', u'The Princess was played by Val\xe9rie Quennessen, a French actress with relatively few previous roles. Her debut in American cinema was in the film Rankat kielikurssit (1979).', u'The scene with Conan on the throne of Aquilonia was filmed in the Shepperton Studios facility in Shepperton, Surrey, England. The facility has formed the primary filming locations of various famous films such as The Omen (1976), The Boys from Brazil (1978), Alien (1979), and The Elephant Man (1980).', u'The principal photography was supposed to take place in Yugoslavia. but the Yugoslavian film industry proved ill-equipped for large-scale film production. There were also concerns over the stability of the country following the death of President Josip Broz Tito (1892-1980). The producers elected to move the project to Spain, which was cheaper and where resources were more easily available. However, the relocation from Yugoslavia to Spain delayed filming for several months. Ironically, there was a coup in Spain while they were there.', u""The interior sets for the Tower of Serpents and Thulsa Doom's temple were located in a large warehouse, 20 miles (32 km) outside Madrid. Additional sets for the Tower of Serpents were constructed in an abandoned hangar of the Torrej\xf3n Air Base, a Spanish Air Force base in the vicinity of Madrid."", u'The Cimmerian village was built in a forest near the Valsa\xedn ski resort, south of Segovia. To simulate snow in the village, the crew used marble shavings scattered on the ground.', u'While several large sets were built for the film, their number had to be limited due to budget constrains. John Milius did not want to rely on optical effects and matte paintings (painted landscapes) to film the remaining scenes. The crew instead adopted miniature effect techniques (playing on perspective) to achieve the illusion of size and grandeur for several scenes. Scale models of structures were constructed by special effects and visual effects artist Emilio Ruiz del R\xedo and positioned in front of the cameras so that they appeared as full-sized structures on film.', u'Film designer Ron Cobb had to decide about how the Hyborian Age buildings and structures should look like, having no precedent on what to work on. He though that they should try ""to invent [their] own fantasy history"", and yet maintain a ""realistic, historical look"". He decided to avoid Greco-Roman imagery to avoid association with the Italian ""sword-and-sandal""/""Peplum film genre"" of the late 1950s and 1960s which had fallen out of fashion. He instead took inspiration from Dark Age Europe, the Vikings, and the Mongols.', u'Stunt co-ordinator Terry Leonard had recently worked on Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981). He helped Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sandahl Bergman, and Gerry Lopez perform their stunts and the fight scenes. According to Leonard, the trio performed the scenes without needing stuntmen as replacements.', u""Executives insisted for certain violent scenes to be removed prior to the film's release. Among them were close-up shots on the decapitated head of Conan's mother, Subotai's slaying of a monster at the top of the Tower of Serpents, and Conan chopping off a pickpocket's arm in a bazaar."", u'A few critics of the 1980s expected that any film based on pulp stories, comic books, or both to be inherently light-hearted or corny. They were both surprised and dismayed by the use of Nietzschean themes and ideology.', u'While the film was only a modest box office hit, it was still among the most commercially successful comic book and pulp adaptations of the 1980s.', u""Gilbert Taylor was the film's original cinematographer and was replaced after the dailies of the first interior footage that they shot looked too dark. Taylor had been working with very low light levels and being sure his exposures were all right, asked to send the negative to a UK lab to get developed. But when the dailies still came severely underexposed, they found out that there was a problem with the stop markings on the lenses, which weren't accurate and didn't reflect the actual transmission of light through the lens to the film stock. Since the first assistant cameraman of the show was Peter Taylor, Gilbert's son, the production fired him as they felt he should have checked the lenses prior to the shoot. When his son was fired, Taylor left the picture and was replaced by TV cameraman Duke Callaghan, who had shot Jeremiah Johnson (1972), scripted by John Milius. The final cut of the picture only feature a few scenes which were shot by Taylor, such as the opening scenes with the village being attacked, Conan trying to escape from the wolves (a scene which has been timed day-for-day for the Blu-ray, but looked like day-for-night in previous transfers) and the scene with Conan and the witch. When Callaghan took over the film, the crew performed precise lens test to hand mark the actual and real transmission stop on each lens, and thus the underexposure risk due to faulty markings was gone."", u'John Milius devised the tactics and booby traps. They built a miniature model set for a dry run before shooting.', u'The Conan series is considered a pioneering one of the ""sword and sorcery"" genre. Although the genre properly started in the 1930s, it was only named in 1961. The term was coined by writer Fritz Leiber.', u'Robert E. Howard, creator of Conan, was proud of his Irish heritage and deeply fascinated with the Celts. As a result Conan and several other protagonists by his pen were proto-Celts, Celts, or Irish themselves. This tends to be contrasted with the anti-Irish sentiment still prevalent in the 1930s.', u'The defining style of the original Conan stories was a combination of a ""hardboiled, dark and realistic"" tone with more fantastic elements. According to a description of the effect on the genre of fantasy: ""Howard did for fantasy fiction what Dashiell Hammett did for crime fiction.""', u'Insight into the thought processes of Robert E. Howard is provided by his correspondence with fellow writer H.P. Lovecraft. He is also considered influenced by Lovecraft and his writings, including the Cthulhu Mythos. According to an early reviewer of Howard, ""Howard used a good deal of the Lovecraft cosmogony and demonology"" and Conan ""had recourse to magic and the aid of Lovecraft\'s Elder Gods.""', u'The role of Thulsa Doom as a cult leader in the film seems influenced by real-life cult leaders who had a presence in the news. The most prominent of them were probably Charles Manson (1934-) of the Manson Family and Jim Jones (1931-1978) of the Peoples Temple. The perceived negative role of cults in society gave rise to an anti-cult movement that was prominent in the 1980s.', u'While Conan did not suffer slavery in the original Conan tales, he did experience it in pastiche works. In the short story ""Legions of the Dead"" (1978) by L. Sprague de Camp and Lin Carter, a teenaged Conan joins the Aesir in conflict with the Hyperboreans. He is captured by the enemy and enslaved.', u'The film contains scenes where Conan is chased by wolves, discovers of a crypt, and within it a sword and a mummy. These are all taken from the short story ""The Thing in the Crypt"" (1967) by L. Sprague de Camp and Lin Carter. Missing is the key scene from the short story, the mummy rising and fighting Conan.', u'Despite a long career in short stories, novels, and comic books, the circumstances of Conan\'s last years and death have yet to be recorded. The only major attempt at a finale to the series remains the novel ""Conan of the Isles"" (1968) by L. Sprague de Camp and Lin Carter. In the novel, Conan is in his 60s and abdicates the throne of Aquilonia to go on one final quest. He sails to the Western Ocean and has an adventure in Antillia, a chain of islands in the western part of the Western ocean (Hyborian Atlantic Ocean). He survives the tale and sails further west, into uncharted territories. Robert E. Howard wrote in his 1930s notes about Conan\'s life that Conan would have further adventures following the end of his reign, to Khitai (Hyborian China), Hyrkania and areas to less known areas beyond them. He also noted that Conan also visited ""a nameless continent in the western hemisphere, and roamed among the islands adjacent to it."", indicating that Conan visited the Americas during the Hyborian Age. However, he died before writing any tale recording these adventures. Events in Aquilonia following Conan\'s abdication, set during the reign of Conan II (Conan\'s son, formerly known as Prince Conn), are recorded in the frame story of the novel ""Conan at the Demon\'s Gate"" (1994) by Roland J. Green. However there is no new information about Conan himself. The thought of Conan as his death approaches are recorded in the narrative poem ""Death-Song of Conan the Cimmerian"" (1972) by Lin Carter, but the poem offers no indication of the time and location of the event.', u'In the film and its novelization, the raiders who enslave a child Conan are Vanir. The Vanir are creations of Robert E. Howard, living in Vanaheim, one of the far north realms of the Hyborian Age. The tribe and their neighbors (and rivals) the Aesir of Asgard are fantasy counterparts of Dark-Age and Viking Age Scandinavia. Their names derive from surviving records of Norse mythology. The Aesir and Vanir were two related (and rival) groups of gods. The Aesir were the principle pantheon and included prominent deities such as Odin, Frigg, Thor, Baldr/Balder, and Tyr. Vanir were a lesser pantheon including such gods as Njord, Frey/Freyr, and Freyja. Asgard was the realm of the Aesir in Norse mythology, while Vanaheim/Vanaheimr was the realm of the Vanir. The earliest prominent attestation for both of them were the works of writer and historian Snorri Sturluson (1179-1241), and there are theories that he coined the terms himself.', u'Hyrkania and Hyrkanian characters figure in the scenes depicting Conan\'s career as a pit fighter. In literature and comic books, Hyrkania appears as one of the eastern realms of the Hyborian Age. The most prominent Hyrkanian character is Red Sonja. The realm serves as a fantasy counterpart to both Mongolia and the ancient satrapy of Hyrcania, in the southern coast of the Caspian Sea. Hyrcania means ""Wolf-land"" in Old Persian. The area became proverbial for its fauna and references appear in several literary works by authors such as Virgil, Miguel de Cervantes and William Shakespeare.', u'The phrase ""Between the years when the oceans drank Atlantis and the gleaming cities, and the years of the rise of the Sons of Aryas"" derives directly from the introduction of the Phoenix ""The Phoenix on the Sword"" (1932), the first Conan story. The story set the Hyborian Age, which it introduced, between the sinking of Atlantis and the emergence of the Aryans (Indo-Europeans). The term Sons of Aryas can be considered an allusion to the then-contemporary concept that the Aryans formed an ""Aryan race"". The term derives from an ancient Indo-Iranian term for ""noble"" and was popularized in Europe by 18th and 19th century linguists. It was popularized in the United States by the best-selling book ""Race Life of the Aryan Peoples"" (1907) by Joseph Widney (1841-1938). which featured the Aryans as an empire-building race. His concept included every Indo-European speaking Empire from the ancient Hittite Empire to the so-called American Empire. The term has largely fallen out of fashion with scholars due to its associations with scientific racism and Nazism.', u'The description of Conan in literature and artistic renditions can vary widely. His blue eyes and black hair are frequently described by his creator and sequels and adaptations tend to maintain these elements. His hair is almost always described as long or forming a mane, but the ""square-cut mane"" described in the original tales has been inconsistently used. Howard once mentioned Conan having a hairy chest, but this is again inconsistently used. The clothing of the character in Howard\'s tales tended to change according to the setting, featured culture and weather conditions of a story. Later depictions tend to have Conan dressed in a loincloth or other minimal clothing, to fit the modern concept of a barbarian. A light chain shirt and a horned helmet are also popularly used for Conan depictions, particularly those set in his younger years. While Howard regularly described Conan as tall or even a giant, he never gave specifics about his height or weight in adult life. His only description of a 15-year-old Conan mentioned him as standing 6 feet tall (1.8 m) and weighing 180 pounds (82 kg), but with the indication that he was not fully grown. No human is ever described as stronger than Conan, though several are described as taller than him. He is described and depicted as muscular, but not so far as to limit his agility. His skin color is described as bronze, due to constant exposure to the sun. One of Howard\'s descriptions of a middle-aged King Conan mentions his scarred face, but facial or other scars are rarely used in his portrayals.', u'Subotai is not based on any Conan character. He is named after and loosely based on a historical figure: Subutai (c. 1175-1248), a general of the Mongol Empire. He was a close companion and primary military strategist of Genghis Khan.', u""Arnold Schwarzenegger's contract restricted him from starring in other sword and sorcery films."", u'The seductive witch was played by Cassandra Gava who was previously known for television roles. Her most notable one was a recurring role in Trapper John, M.D. (1979).', u'The snake cult\'s orgy includes the depiction of a ""half-naked slave girl chained to a pillar, with a snarling leopard at her feet"". Though not appearing in any Conan story, the scene is lifted from a Frank Frazetta painting about the Hyborian Age.', u""The film made use of human dummies and fake body parts to inflate crowd numbers, depict dead bodies, and mutilated body parts. The two prominent decapitation scenes of the film also used fake heads. In the scene where Thulsa Doom decapitates Conan's mother, the actress was protected by the sword by a Plexiglas shield. An artificial head was dropped into the camera's view and another, more elaborate one was used for the close-up shots. In the scene where Conan decapitates Thulsa Doom, Arnold Schwarzenegger hacked at a dummy and pulled a concealed chain to detach its head."", u""Despite his use and perceived overuse of the damsel in distress trope in the Conan stories, Robert E. Howard held feminist views. He was interested in the achievements and capabilities of women. This seems to have influenced his creation of a number of strong female characters, such as Conan's love interests Belit and Valeria."", u""Charles Bronson, Sylvester Stallone, and William Smith were considered for the lead role. Smith was cast as Conan's father."", u'Conan was created by writer Robert E. Howard in 1932. His stories were published in the magazine ""Weird Tales"" (1923-1954), which specialized in fantasy and horror stories.', u'Aquilonia seems to be based on both the Roman Empire and the Carolingian Empire, both among the superpowers of their respective time. It seems to be named after the ancient city of Aquilonia, among the main cities of the Samnites in Italy. Its modern counterpart is the city of Agnone. There have been other cities of the same name in modern Italy, Croatia, and France. Aquilo is another name for the ancient deity Boreas, a personification of the north wing. Some writers have suggested that Howard also chose the name for its similarity to Aquitaine, a territory in France which figured prominently in Medieval history.', u'While all of the Hyborian Age\'s countries and kingdoms are named after historical and mythological realms and people, Robert E. Howard\'s rendition of Hyperborea (""beyond the North Wind"") is influenced by the Hyperborean cycle of Clark Ashton Smith (1893-1961).', u'Robert E. Howard feared ageing and old age, which possibly influenced his decision to die young. Conan supposedly lived to his own old age, but most Conan stories have him young and virile. Few Conan stories feature him in his middle age and fewer in his 60s.', u'While several of the cast and crew of the film experienced a career boom following its release, only Arnold Schwarzenegger, Oliver Stone and Basil Poledouris went on to create further successful projects. James Earl Jones was already a successful stage and screen actor.', u'Among the directors considered for the film were Oliver Stone himself and Joe Alves.', u'The first draft of a script for a Conan film was written by Edward Summer and comic book writer Roy Thomas in 1976. It involved Conan being employed by a ""dodgy priest to kill an evil wizard"", and would be partly based on the short story ""Rogues in the House"" (1934). The script was abandoned early. Thomas was chosen for helping with the script because he had written hundreds of Conan stories for Marvel Comics.', u'Oliver Stone\'s script about a Conan tale set in a post-apocalyptic future involved Conan leading an army in a massive battle against a horde of 10,000 mutants. It would incorporate elements from Conan\'s battles in the short stories ""Black Colossus"" (1933) and ""A Witch Shall be Born"" (1934).', u'Most outdoor scenes were shot in the province of Almer\xeda, which offered a semi-arid climate, diverse terrain (deserts, beaches, mountains), and Roman and Moorish structures that could be adapted for many settings.', u'Scenes of a bazaar were filmed at Alcazaba of Almer\xeda, a fortified complex in Almeria. It was constructed by the Caliphate of C\xf3rdoba during the Middle Ages. The Alcazaba has also been used in the filming of such films as Never Say Never Again (1983) and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989).', u'The designs of the Tree of Woe and the costumes have been seen as being influenced by epic opera settings and costumes, in particular the popular ""Der Ring des Nibelungen"" (The Ring of the Nibelung, 1876) by Richard Wagner (1813-1883). These operas were in turn loose adaptations of the Norse sagas and the epic poem ""Nibelungenlied"" (The Song of the Nibelungs, 13th century) which depict Dark Age Europe.', u'Several action scenes in Conan were filmed with a ""mini-jib"", a remote-controlled electronic camera mounted on a motorized lightweight crane. The device was created by special effects supervisor Nick Allder. It was first used in the filming of fantasy film Dragonslayer (1981).', u'Jody Samson, the swordsmith of the film, also created swords, knives, and daggers for such films as First Knight (1995) and The Mask of Zorro (1998).', u""The scene involving a fight and decapitation of a giant snake in the Tower of Serpents made use of three mechanical snakes. They were 36 feet (11 m) long, the snakes' body had a diameter of 2.5 feet (0.76 m), and their heads were 2.5 feet (0.76 m) long and 2 feet (0.61 m) wide."", u'The first version of the ghosts from the ghost scene was rejected by the producers for its perceived similarity to a scene from Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981). Visual Concepts Engineering (VCE) created another version using cel animation and related techniques. This one was accepted.', u'Following the end of filming, John Milius sent Basil Poledouris a tape with scenes set to the music of Richard Wagner, Igor Stravinsky, and Sergei Prokofiev. He wanted to illustrate which emotional overtones matched each scene.', u'Jackie Chan was originally pursued for a role.', u""There were no architectural plans for Thulsa Doom's mountain fortress. The set designer looked at some drawings and just built it on the spot."", u""It didn't snow leading up filming, so the crew started putting powder on the ground and then it snowed."", u""Arnold Schwarzenegger had trouble riding the camel. It kept walking him into the hut's wooden beams."", u'In the original screenplay, the skeleton of the Atlantean General comes alive and fights Conan when Conan takes his sword.', u'Writer Michael Moorcock believes that Conan was influenced by previous characters. He suggested two literary ancestors of Conan: Natty Bumppo by James Fenimore Cooper (1789-1851) and Tarzan by Edgar Rice Burroughs (1875-1950).', u'Thulsa Doom precedes Conan as a literary character. He first appeared in the short story ""The Cat and the Skull"" (written 1928, published 1967). His face there is described ""like a bare white skull, in whose eye sockets flamed livid fire."" He is seemingly invulnerable. His first published appearance, under the alias Kathulos, was in the story ""Skull-Face"" (1929). There he is depicted as an Atlantean necromancer still alive in modern times. He is planning world conquest from 1920s London.', u""Despite his relatively brief use by creator Robert E. Howard in adaptations and comic books, Thulsa Doom is featured as the archenemy of Kull. Since the character is depicted as immortal in the comic books, he appeared as still alive in Conan's time. Conan lives thousands of years following the death of Kull."", u""'Robert E. Howard' (qVv) based much of his original characterization of Thulsa Doom/Kathulos on the popular literary villain Fu Manchu by Sax Rohmer. Like Fu Manchu, his base of operations is London, and he heads a vast conspiracy of Asians, Africans, and Semites against the Western civilization. He is served by an Asian woman who falls in love with the hero of the story, much as Fu Manchu's female associates served as love interests to his enemies."", u'The original Conan stories by Robert E. Howard featured few recurring characters and no long-term foes. The exception was Toth-Amon who was a threat to Conan, but never met him in person. As a result, Conan never had an archenemy. This changed when pastiche writers and comic book writers decided to cast Toth-Amon. The film instead chooses to promote Thulsa Doom in this role.', u""Thulsa Doom demonstrates his absolute control over his followers by having one of them voluntarily jump off a high ledge to her death. This was likely based on a story about Hassan-i Sabbah (c. 1050-1124), master of the Hashshashin (Assassins). He reportedly had one of his followers leap to his death to demonstrate his power to visiting dignitaries. The cult of Thulsa Doom posing a threat to the powerful rulers of the Hyborian Kingdoms and killing may also be loosely based on the actions which coined the Assassins' reputation in the Middle Ages."", u""The film's story has a blacksmith as father of Conan. This is based on the works of L. Sprague de Camp in fleshing out the background of Conan."", u'The film is listed as one of a wave of Hollywood films depicting ""heroic adventures in supernatural lands of fables"", following the success of Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977).', u'The Italian ""sword-and-sandal""/""Peplum film genre"" bears some similarity with the sword-and-sorcery, mixing history and fantasy elements. It featured film series about heroic strongmen such as Maciste, Hercules, Ursus, Samson, and Goliath. The films were very popular from 1958 to 1965, but then went out to fashion. The release of Conan in 1982 and the apparent popularity of sword and sorcery directly led to an Italian revival of the Peplum genre in the 1980s. Films such as Ator, the Fighting Eagle (1982) were directly influenced by Conan.', u'The Riddle of Steel prevalent in the film seems to be resolved by the answer that strength lies not in steel swords. While the weapons are initially hinted to have powers of their own, they are later revealed to be mostly useless and dependent on the strength of their wielders. Thulsa Doom , who sought the answer to the Riddle, comes to the conclusion that the power of flesh is stronger than steel.', u'Some critics believe that the perceived fascist and individualist themes of the film are not contradictory. Instead they are connected.', u'Conan was the most commercially successful created by Robert E. Howard. Several series characters by Howard never appeared in more than two published stories during his lifetime. Conan appeared in 18 published stories by the time Howard died.', u'Reviewer Hoffman Reynolds Hays pointed out the similarities between Conan and Superman, both creations of the 1930s. Both characters were ""wish-projections"" of their creators, both were omnipotent heroes that faced and conquered evil.', u'The copyright status of the original Conan stories and the character himself is disputed in the 21st century. The copyright of the stories was apparently not renewed when originally needed (in the late 1950s and early 1960s) and those stories published in the 1930s may now be in the public domain. Meanwhile, the rights to the Howard estate and the associated characters passed through a variety of owners. More recently they have been acquired by Paradox Entertainment. Paradox was then itself acquired by Cabinet Entertainment which is trying to ascertain its rights over all properties associated with Conan, Kull, Solomon Kane and the other characters created by Howard.', u'The original script by Oliver Stone included the scene where Conan was crucified and this was one of the few elements retained from it. The scene derives from one of the original Conan short stories: ""A Witch Shall be Born"" (1934). Summarized: ""the mighty Cimmerian, hanging on a cross, nails driven through his hands and feet, tearing out the throat of a vulture which comes to peck out his eyes."" The scene is considered one of the most memorable ones in the entire series. The main villain of the story, Queen Taramis/Salome, was not used for the film but was apparently the inspiration for the villain of the same name in Conan the Destroyer (1984).', u'The scene of the film with with Conan and his fellow thieves scaling a tower, battling a giant snake, and stealing a jewel seems to be derived by another of the original Conan stories: ""The Tower of the Elephant"" (1933) set in Zamora. It is among the most famous of the Conan stories. However, none of the characters of the story beside Conan were used in the film.', u'The kingdom of Zamora is not original to the film. It is one of the countries of the Hyborian Age created by Robert E. Howard and serves as the setting of several stories. Howard likely named it after the city of Zamora in Spain. The culture of Zamora as depicted in the stories has elements from the historical Romani (Gypsy) culture.', u""The film twice mentions that Conan will eventually become king of Aquilonia. Conan's first appearance in 1932 actually has Conan on the throne and a few stories by both Robert E. Howard and others have depicted Conan as a middle-aged king. This element has yet to make it into film and television adaptations."", u'The literary and comic book incarnations of Thulsa Doom bear strong resemblance to the fantasy concept of the lich: skull-faced, skeletal, and undead necromancers. The term was popularized by the Dungeons & Dragons franchise and has since appeared in several media. Gary Gygax (1938-2008), co-creator of the original Dungeons & Dragons game, pointed that he based his description of the lich on an undead and immortal character from the short story ""The Sword of the Sorcerer"" (1969) by Gardner Fox (1911-1986). The character is named Afgorkon, has a skull-face and a skeletal form, is a powerful sorcerer, is said to be at least 50,000-years-old, and faces a barbarian hero with similarities to the Howard characters. The term lich for the undead long precedes the modern concept, however, it has been traced back to the short story ""The Death of Halpin Frayser"" (1891) by Ambrose Bierce (1842-c. 1914).', u'Conan\'s encounter with the witch and Subotai was shot among the Ciudad Encantada rock formations in the province of Cuenca. Due to their distinctive shapes, the rock formations have been used in the filming of various films such as spaghetti western ""The Mercenary""/""A Professional Gun"" (1968) and the dinosaur-themed film ""The Valley of Gwangi"" (1969). Cuenca is part of the historic La Mancha region, famously the setting of the two-volume novel ""The Ingenious Gentleman Don Quixote of La Mancha"" (1605, 1615) by Miguel de Cervantes (1547-1616).', u'While Valeria is considered a strong female character, not everyone agrees. Critics of the film see her as either ""a traditional male warrior buddy in a sexy female body"", eye candy, and overly sexualized. They point to the film\'s promotional artwork as presenting Conan as the dominant, sword-wielding hero, and Valeria as a squatting woman in a leather body-suit. Some have even claimed that the film is part of a backlash against feminism in the 1980s and a celebration of masculinity.', u'The role of Conan as a child was played by Jorge Sanz, who was at the time a prolific child actor in Spain. He was went on to a career as a professional actor in adult life.', u'The set of the city of Shadizar was constructed in the Almer\xedan desert. The crew refurbished the fort left behind from the filming of western El Condor (1970).', u'While individualism has been a theme of the Conan franchise since the 1930s, its inclusion in the film has been considered as a product of the 1980s. The theme of individualism is strongly associated with the speeches and policies of President Ronald Reagan. Other associations with Reaganism have been claimed. For example, film writer Dr. Dave Saunders views the film as one where Conan stands for the American hero and Thulsa Doom stands for the evil oppressors, the Soviet Union. Academics Douglas Kellner and Michael Ryan view the film as one Conan stands for the American individual and Thulsa Doom stands for an overly domineering federal government.', u'John Huston was considered for the role of King Osric.', u'In Spain was a re-release in Barcelona (Phenomena) in 2016. The film was projected for 1 day in subtitled version.', u""Jack Palance, Joe Don Baker and Nick Nolte were all considered for the role of Conan's father."", u'The model snake was so big they could fit only part of it onto the set at a time.', u'Arnold Schwarzenegger was pretty beaten up after many takes of getting thrown into the fountain. He also got sunburned from hanging on a tree all day.', u'Arnold Schwarzenegger had not heard of the Conan stories by Robert E. Howard when Ed Pressman approached him for the role.', u'Arnold Schwarzenegger later went on record in an interview that he was born to play Conan.', u""Conan's crucifixion, death and resurrection was influence by the death and resurrection of Jesus."", u'The casting of Arnold Schwarzenegger as Conan, has made certain scholars and reviewers point that this turns Conan from a Celtic into a Germanic character. Some have called him ""Aryan"". Some viewed the film as a tale of the victory of a Germanic/Aryan hero over a black/African villain, giving the film a racial theme.', u'Some critics of both Conan and other sword and sorcery films believe that they are influenced to various degrees with fascist ideology. Others have pointed to perceived influences from the films of director Leni Riefenstahl, who is strongly associated with Nazi Germany.', u'In the Conan stories by Marvel Comics, Thulsa Doom does not need a full body to survive. After his body was destroyed, his skull remained. It was sentient, could still communicate with others and manipulate them to his own goals.', u'The ""puddles of human blood"" depicted in the floors of certain scenes were mostly animal blood gathered from slaughterhouses.', u'John Milius wanted the village attack to be violent to show the impact.', u'Robert E. Howard created a formula for the average Conan story. The formula had Conan ""rescuing a damsel in distress from a monster in some ruins."" While these stories are not considered among the better or more ambitious ones in the Conan series, they were the easiest to write and easiest to sell during the Great Depression. The film creators chose to largely ignore them as sources.', u'Some of the last Conan tales by Robert E. Howard involved conflicts with the savage Picts in the Western borders of the Hyborian kingdoms. These stories were inspired by the American Indian Wars and had strong Western genre elements. By this point in his life, Howard had found a new fascination with the tales of elderly American Civil War veterans, Texas Rangers, and pioneers.', u""Among Robert E. Howard's tales for some of his series characters were elements of burlesque and slapstick. These elements tend to be absent from the Conan tales."", u'Writer L. Sprague de Camp converted several Robert E. Howard about other protagonists and other settings to Conan tales set in the Hyborian Age. For example, the story ""Hawks over Egypt"" which was originally set during the last year of the reign of Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah, Fatimid caliph (reigned 996-1021) was reworked to ""Hawks over Shem."" The process of rewritings involved changing names, eliminating gunpowder, and dragging in a supernatural element.""', u'Thulsa Doom\'s cult seems to worship the serpent god Set. Set worship features prominently in the Conan stories since his first appearance in 1932 and in many of the adaptations. He is the main deity of the Stygians, who offer him human sacrifices: ""chained captives had knelt by the hundreds during festivals to have their heads hacked off by the priest-king in honor of Set"".', u'In the original draft of the screenplay by Oliver Stone, the film took place in a post apocalyptic world inhabited by mutants and animals.', u'The script called for weapons of many different kinds.', u'In the Spanish dubbed voices there are two mismatches with the original English: the first happens during the narration in the prologue, where ""hijos de Aryas"" (sons of Aryas) was misspelled as ""soles de Aries"" (suns of Aries). The second happens when Conan and Subotai meets by first time with Valeria, after Conan misspelling ""No eres un guarda"" (you\'re not a guard) as ""No eres una diosa"" (you\'re not a god), creating an unwitting third mismatch about god/goddess. Although there is no explanation about these changes, it were caused probably due to phonetics similarities.', u""The film was released three months and three weeks after what would have been Robert E. Howard's 76th birthday."", u""When Thulsa Doom (James Earl Jones) points to one of his priestesses and she jumps to her death, a women's free fall record was set at 182 feet by stunt woman Corrie Jansen."", u'Arnold Schwarzenegger said in the behind the scenes features that during the crucifixion scene, they used a live vulture to peck at his wounds. Then for the close up they used a real dead vulture they found for him to actually bite into its throat. After they cut, they immediately had Arnold rinse his mouth out to avoid disease.', u""The script called for Conan to throw a torch into the palace's central window/balcony. Arnold Schwarzenegger missed on the first attempt, but no retake was possible as the set proceeded to burn to the ground, as intended."", u""Conan's prayer to Crom just before the Battle Of The Mounds begins is his last dialogue in the movie."", u""King Osric's death was cut from the film, in which he is murdered in his throne room by Thulsa Doom's henchmen. It can be found on the DVD."", u'The scene of the crucifixion on the dead tree was shot in Almeria, Spain. When Conan is nursed back to health, we can see mysterious magical figures drawn all over his face. One of them is the ""indalo"" (a red symbol resembling a man with his arms over his head), a traditional symbol of the province of Almer\xeda used since ancient times by the local inhabitants to expel witches and lightning. Now it has become a symbol and tourist trademark icon for the province and its tourism industry.']","[u'Sweden::2 April 1982', u'France::7 April 1982', u'Spain::15 April 1982', u'Netherlands::29 April 1982', u'Greece::14 May 1982', u'USA::14 May 1982', u'Argentina::20 May 1982', u'Japan::3 July 1982', u'Brazil::9 July 1982', u'Peru::28 July 1982', u'Colombia::5 August 1982', u'Denmark::6 August 1982', u'Finland::20 August 1982', u'West Germany::25 August 1982', u'UK::26 August 1982', u'Italy::10 September 1982', u'Hong Kong::16 September 1982', u'Portugal::30 September 1982', u'Ireland::15 October 1982', u'Norway::28 October 1982', u'Australia::16 December 1982', u'South Korea::20 May 1983', u'Turkey::14 November 1983', u'Czechoslovakia::1 January 1991', u'Italy::November 2002 (Turin Film Festival)', u'Spain::8 June 2012 (Phenomena - Barcelona) (subtitled version)\n (premiere)', u'Spain::20 April 2016 (Barcelona) (re-release) (subtitled version)', u'France::5 October 2016 (Absurde Seance)']"

He yells that he's going to call Ronald Reagan (then the governor) to protest their inaction. In the very next scene, Marlowe is brought to Marty Augustine's office for a shakedown. One of Augustine's bodyguards is an uncredited Arnold Schwarzenegger, later elected Governor of California. Thus Marlowe, in a way, gets to meet the governor."", u'Philip Marlowe (Elliott Gould)\'s credo was ""It\'s okay with me!"".', u""A portrait of Leonard Cohen is visible in the background during the scene where Philip Marlowe and Eileen Wade are dining together in the Wades' residence. Robert Altman was an admirer of Cohen's, having used three of his songs - 'The Stranger Song', 'Sisters of Mercy' and 'Winter Lady', all from the soundtrack of his earlier western McCabe & Mrs. Miller (1971)."", u""Playing Marty Augustine, director Mark Rydell returned to acting for this movie after an absence of around a decade. After this film, Rydell wouldn't appear again in a filmed production for another fifteen years, until Punchline (1988) in 1988."", u'Reportedly, director Robert Altman did not read all of Raymond Chandler\'s novel ""The Long Goodbye"" prior to production. Instead, Altman preferred to consult Chandler\'s a collection of letters and essays, ""Raymond Chandler Speaking"". Copies of this book were given to cast and crew who were advised to study it.', u'To help establish with the cast and crew the kind of tone he was trying to create, Robert Altman circulated on the set a little-known letter that Raymond Chandler had written, as well as his essay collection ""Raymond Chandler Speaking"". Both pieces are notable for revealing Chandler\'s underlying suicidal tendencies.', u'The film was made and released about twenty years after its source novel of the same name by Raymond Chandler had been first published in 1953.

The members of the orchestra are the male voices singing, and the voice saying ""Be an actor, see Mr. Factor, he\'ll make your kisser look good"" belongs to drummer Gene Krupa. The actual promo film itself is featured in the documentary Benny Goodman: Adventures in the Kingdom of Swing (1977).', u""When Marlowe is trying to get the dog to move away from his car, he calls it Asta. This is the name of the dog owned by Nick and Nora Charles in Dashiell Hammett's The Thin Man stories."", u'Robert Altman and Leigh Brackett spent a lot of time talking over the plot. Altman wanted Marlowe to be a loser. He even nicknamed Elliott Gould\'s character Rip Van Marlowe, as if he had been asleep for 20 years, had woken up, and was wandering around Los Angeles in the early 1970s but ""trying to invoke the morals of a previous era"". Her first draft was too long, and she shortened it, but the ending was inconclusive. She had Marlowe shooting Terry Lennox. Altman conceived of the film as a satire and made several changes to the script, like having Roger Wade commit suicide and having Marty Augustine smash a Coke bottle across his girlfriend\'s face. Altman said, ""it was supposed to get the attention of the audience and remind them that, in spite of Marlowe, there is a real world out there, and it is a violent world"".', u""Marlowe's car was a 1948 Lincoln Continental Cabriolet that belonged to Elliott Gould.
