Evans said, ""That shot is a little bit of bicep porn. \'Zoom in on the biceps\' - that\'s what the script said. Kevin Feige didn\'t airbrush my biceps, that\'s me. It\'s not a utilitarian shot, it\'s a shot where you\'re trying to look heroic. That position (of holding the helicopter with one hand and the ledge with another) is actually a very unnatural position to use to stop something but we used it because I have to flex my bicep, you are trying to make the scene look great. And I genuinely messed my arm doing that shot because of the strain."" Robert Downey Jr. joked that the film-makers didn\'t mind that Evans hurt himself because of how great the shot turned out and they have been using it to promote the film ever since. Anthony Russo revealed that the iconic shot almost did not happen because on the day of the film-making there was a miscommunication with the costume department and Evans came in wearing a thick jacket. They immediately sent him back to change because then they wouldn\'t have been able to film the shot of his muscles bulging as intended in the script.', u""Marvel initially wanted to hire Robert Downey Jr. to reprise Tony Stark as a small role, with just three weeks of work. However, Downey wanted a larger role, which would lead to a bigger payday. Marvel Entertainment CEO Ike Perlmutter was furious over the request, prompting him to order the screenwriters to write Tony Stark out of the script completely. When the deal seemed like it was off the table, Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige pushed to hire Downey, citing that his casting in the film could leave the door open for sequels, new franchises, and dramatic possibilities within the Marvel Cinematic Universe, as Civil War could drive future storylines for these films. As a result with Downey's casting, the actor received a substantial payout that included a back-end participation deal, and another payout if the film's box-office gross succeeded Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014), which it did."", u'(at around 1h 55 mins) When Steve and Bucky remember going on a double date in Brooklyn when they were younger, the Captain mentions Bucky\'s date was a redhead named Dolores, with the nickname ""Dot"".

""Thunderbolt"" Ross (William Hurt) in the film, as a substitute to illustrate the theme of destructive power: ""We thought it would be interesting to use a character who had a fanatical anti-superhero point of view, built on experience. He\'s cornering the Avengers politically now, he\'s out-maneuvering them.""', u'Hope van Dyne was going to become The Wasp in an earlier draft of the script, but she was removed, due to concerns that reducing her role to a cameo alongside the other characters would be a disservice to her as a character. The fact that Evangeline Lilly was pregnant at the time also probably influenced the decision. Kevin Feige has asserted that she will officially take on the Wasp mantle in a substantial role at a later point in Phase 3, which was later revealed to be in a new project titled Ant-Man and the Wasp (2018).', u'This movie marks the beginning of Phase Three in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and is the thirteenth film overall.', u'The Black Panther costume is a combination of a practical costume and visual effects.', u""Costume Designer Judianna Makovsky revealed that for all of Chris Evans's scenes, where he is in regular outfits (outside the suit), they purposefully make him wear t-shirts, which are many sizes smaller than his actual size, so that his muscles pop on camera. Evans said all his t-shirt scenes are scheduled at the start of the filming, because he loses a lot of weight over the months it takes to film a Marvel movie. He said, especially, that filming the action scenes wearing the Captain America suit, makes him lose a lot of his size."", u'The casting for the role of Spider-Man was down to two choices: Tom Holland and Charlie Plummer. While both of them scored good reviews in their respective screentests, there was a split in the casting decision. Marvel, represented by Kevin Feige, wanted Plummer, but Sony Pictures (who owns distribution and film rights to solo Spider-Man films) co-studio chief, Amy Pascal, wanted Holland. In the end, Holland was cast as he had a slight advantage over Plummer due to the age factor. Being seventeen at the time of casting (June 2015), both studios realized that Plummer is still bound by child-labor law, and hence until he reaches eighteen, the filming schedule for Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017) involving Plummer would have to be limited to a few hours per day.', u'During the airport fight scene a truck has the Bluth family logo.

These scenes were filmed at the Iguaz\xfa Falls in Misiones, Argentina.', u""at around 2h 5 mins) The image near the end of the film, of Iron Man blasting Captain America's raised shield, is an homage to the Civil War part seven comic book cover."", u'Paul Bettany describes the Vision as exploring what it means to be human and what love is: ""The only way one can guarantee one\'s loyalty is love.""', u'at around 33 mins) The speech which Sharon Carter makes at Peggy\'s funeral, is taken from a speech which Captain America makes in the comic Amazing Spider-Man #537 - ""Doesn\'t matter what the press says. Doesn\'t matter what the politicians or the mobs say. Doesn\'t matter if the whole country decides that something wrong is something right. This nation was founded on one principle above all else: the requirement that we stand up for what we believe, no matter the odds or the consequences. When the mob and the press and the whole world tell you to move, your job is to plant yourself like a tree beside the river of truth, and tell the whole world - No, you move.""', u""In the film, T'Chaka is slain by Zemo, and his son T'Challa joins with the Avengers to track him down. In the comics, T'Chaka was slain by Klaw, and T'Challa joined with the Fantastic Four."", u'Robert Downey Jr.\'s personal trainer Eric Oram stated that the trick to pitting Captain America against Iron Man ""is to show Iron Man using the minimum force necessary to win the fight, and not to look like he\'s trying to go wild and kill somebody.""', u'Joe Russo portrayed the psychiatrist Theo Broussard, who was killed and replaced by Helmut Zemo during the course of the movie.', u'The words to activate Bucky were, ""Longing, Rusted, Seventeen, Daybreak, Furnace, Nine, Benign, Homecoming, One, Freight Car"". Most of these words had a meaning specific to him.', u'at around 2h 5 mins) Towards the end of the film, Bucky Barnes loses his left (cybernetic) arm. This continues the Marvel Cinematic Universe tradition of a character losing their left arm or hand started in the Phase 2 films, which pays homage to Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980). Other characters who lost an arm in the Marvel Cinematic Universe films: Aldrich Killian in Iron Man 3 (2013), Thor in Thor: The Dark World (2013), Bucky Barnes in Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014), Nebula in Guardians of the Galaxy (2014), Ulysses Klaue in Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), Phil Coulson in Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (2013), and Darren Cross, a.k.a. Yellow Jacket, in Ant-Man (2015). This, therefore, also marks the second time Bucky loses his left arm in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.', u""By the end of the movie, the Avengers logo on Captain America's arm is no longer there, representing the Avengers are no longer his."", u'In the comics, while Spider-Man started off on Iron Man\'s side, he later shifted over to Captain America\'s side after learning that the Pro-Registration Side was imprisoning the captured unregistered heroes in a prison built in another dimension known as the ""Negative Zone"", against their will, without due process (as it is technically not on American soil) until they agreed to register. In the film, he fights on Iron Man\'s side, before being sent home by Iron Man after the battle at the airport in Germany.', u'at around 2h 10 mins) During the Battle of the HYDRA Siberian Facility, when Captain America is asked by Iron Man to stand down, he responds ""I could do this all day"". This is phrase is also said twice in Captain America: The First Avenger (2011), when Steve Rogers is beaten by a bully in an alley and later by Red Skull. Rogers is rescued or helped directly after the sentence is stated.', u""In the movie, Rhodes' spinal column is severely damaged as the result of an accident while he was in the War Machine suit. As a result, Rhodes uses bionic supports on his legs to move around during his recovery. This is a nod to an incident in the comics when Rhodes was badly injured, and had to receive cybernetic implants for his legs, arms, and part of his face making him part cyborg (similar to DC Comic's Cyborg, who is also a black superhero with cybernetic implants) which lasted until Marvel's Dark Reign event, where Rhodes received a new cloned body, into which his mind to be transferred."", u""Ragnarok (Thor's clone) is an integral part of the comic version of Civil War, but not the movie."", u'Stan Lee: (at around 2h 10 mins) towards the end of the film, as a FedEx delivery man. He mispronounces Tony Stark as Tony ""Stank"".', u""In the comics, the second Giant-Man, Bill Foster, is one of the Anti-Registration heroes, who was killed by Thor's clone Ragnarok during the first battle between both sides. The concept of Scott Lang becoming Giant-Man to fight back against Iron Man's team (who was incapable of enlarging himself in the comics) as well as War Machine being injured as a result of Vision's attack (though it was accidental) are similar to this."", u""Spider-Man has two costumes in the film, his original makeshift one he's seen wearing in YouTube footage and which Tony Stark eventually finds in Peter's apartment, and his new costume, created with Tony's collaboration which more closely resembles the classic costume."", u'at around 33 mins) Part of Sharon Carter\'s eulogy for Peggy Carter, was written as part of the Marvel Civil War in the Spider-Man comics by J. Michael Straczynski, Writer and Creator of Babylon 5 (1994), and credited for the story for Thor (2011). The speech comes from an inspirational speech Captain America gives to Spider-Man during the Marvel Civil War, to explain why he continues to fight against the Superhuman Registration Act, when the country he represents are all for it. As a child, Captain America memorized a monologue that influenced his understanding of what it meant not only to be a patriot, but what it really meant to be an American. The whole philosophy stems from the writing of Mark Twain, on a monologue known as, ""In a Republic, who is the Country?""', u""at around 2h 10 mins) In the climax, before destroying the suit's arc reactor, Cap tears the Iron Man helmet from Tony's face. If he had not done this before the suit lost power, Stark likely would have suffocated, implying that Rogers was simply trying to end the fight rather than kill Tony."", u'In Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014), Captain America, Black Widow, and Falcon are arrested by HYDRA posing as S.H.I.E.L.D., which they escaped, having been freed by Maria Hill. In this movie, Captain America, Falcon, and Winter Soldier are also arrested by German Special Forces, and escape after Winter Soldier goes rogue, with help from Agent 13 Sharon Carter.', u'at around 1h 40 mins) When Redwing hits Iron Man in the head during the airport scene, a circle of ""feathers"", possibly shrapnel, can be seen, as a reference to when characters are hit in cartoons or comics.', u'Multiple references to different themes that aren\'t related to the Marvel Cinematic Universe are made throughout the film: While confined, Falcon tells Iron Man to bring Mark Fuhrman if he wants him to talk (Mark Fuhrman was a key part in the 1994-5 O.J. Simpson trial, having been thought to frame the football player because of his hatred towards black people), and during the final scene in Siberia, Iron Man calls Bucky Barnes ""Manchurian Candidate"", referring to the twice-filmed novel, in which American soldiers are thought to be brainwashed.', u'According to the commentary, Cap dropping the shield foreshadows the appearance of the Nomad costume, a short period in the 70s comics, where Cap continued to act as a hero without government sanction.', u""The reason for Thor and the Hulk's absence in the film, is Thor returned to Asgard out of concern for the dark vision that was given to him by Scarlet Witch, and The Hulk vanished. However, their absences in the film are resolved in Thor: Ragnarok (2017), which takes place during this film."", u'During the closing credits the song ""Left Hand Free"" by the band Alt-J plays. This song is significant, due to the fact that Bucky loses his robotic left arm during his fight with Iron Man.', u'The car Tony drives up to the compound in is an 2015 Orange Audi R8.', u""Chris Evans' screentime is five minutes longer than Robert Downey Jr.'s. Evans appears on screen for thirty-nine minutes, while Downey appears for thirty-four minutes."", u'Secretary of State Thaddeus E. ""Thunderbolt"" Ross (William Hurt) is the same General that hunted Bruce Banner, a.k.a. Hulk in The Incredible Hulk (2008) (played by Edward Norton). If you notice, his entire career was placed in the capture of Hulk, which ended in failure (as seen during a pre-credits scene of him drinking and meeting Stark in a bar, in mention of the Avengers Initiative). During this movie, nothing is mentioned of this encounter, nor the meeting between Stark and him at the end. What this means, is that the goverment had full knowledge of the Avengers involvement within all circumstances (outside of Thor, due to Asgard being out of reach).', u""In the narrative behind why Zemo wanted revenge on The Avengers: Zemo's family was killed in the battle of Sokovia, which he blamed The Avengers. Zemo decided to unleash vengeance on The Avengers by framing The Winter Soldier for the murder of T'chaka and find footage of Barnes assassinating Tony Stark's parents, and use it to force Captain America, The Winter Soldier, and Iron Man to fight and kill each other. With the Avengers divided and fighting each other, and with the truth of Stark's parents murder exposed. Zemo would had brought down The Avengers, and had his revenge."", u""One of two films released in the same year which show the parents of a multi-billionaire superhero being murdered. In this movie, Tony Stark's parents are murdered in a flashback. Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016) had a scene where the parents of Bruce Wayne are murdered. Both Bruce Wayne and Tony Stark share a lot of common characteristics. Both are extremely intelligent superheroes with no superhuman powers other that their gadgets and suits. Tony Stark is the CEO of Stark Industries (founded by his father), whereas Bruce Wayne is the CEO of Wayne Corp (founded by his merchant ancestors)."", u""There is an extra scene, in which Barnes decides to go back into suspended animation until something can be done about his conditioning, and Black Panther, who knows the truth about his father's assassination, and that Barnes is innocent, says that he and Barnes are victims of Zemo. This hints the possibilities of there being another Civil War movie, and that now Black Panther knows the truth about his father's death, it's most likely, he will take Captain America's side over Iron Man."", u'All three Captain America movies involve Captain America falling into a body of water: The Arctic Ocean in Captain America: The First Avenger (2011), the Potomac River in Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014), and possibly River Spree in this movie.', u'Stan Lee\'s second cameo playing a delivery man. In this film, he plays a FedEx driver delivering a package to Tony Stark. In Fantastic Four (2005), he played Willie Lumpkin, a USPS mailman who delivered Reed Richards\' (""Mr. Fantastic"") mail to him early in the movie.', u""Rogers' letter to Stark, hints at Captain America and Winter Soldier's return in Avengers: Infinity War (2018)."", u""In Knocked Up (2007), Paul Rudd's character argues with his wife about having snuck out to see Spider-Man 3 (2007). In this movie, Paul Rudd's character (Scott Lang, a.k.a. Ant-Man) fights Spider-Man."", u'This is the second film, featuring Don Cheadle, in which a ""pinch"" is used to set an electromagnetic pulse that interrupts the electrical grid. In Ocean\'s Eleven (2001) Cheadle\'s character, rogue explosives expert Basher Tarr, uses one stolen from a research lab to shut down Las Vegas\' electrical grid while his partners in crime robbed three casinos. In this movie, the villain Zemo ships a pinch to unwitting workers at a substation. The workers unwittingly trigger the pinch, and Zemo, posing as a psychologist sent to examine Bucky Barnes after he was captured in Germany, uses the ensuing blackout to interact with Barnes unobserved, and trigger Barnes\' Soviet ""Winter Soldier"" programming. Nothing good comes of it.', u'Each Marvel superhero movie has a main theme: -Iron Man (2008) and sequels - Weaponry and technology. -The Incredible Hulk (2008) - Mutation and nuclear power. -Captain America: The First Avenger (2011) and sequels - Experimentation and espionage. -Thor (2011) and sequels - Mythology and religion. -Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) - Extra-terrestrial life and cosmic beings. -Ant-Man (2015) - Telepathy and control of animals. -Doctor Strange (2016) - Magic and witchcraft. -The Avengers (2012) - Alien Invasion. -Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015) - Artificial Intelligence.', u'An ""avenger"" is a person who seeks revenge upon those who have wronged themselves or others. Iron Man and Black Panther both seek revenge upon The Winter Soldier.

Chris Evans stated that it got to the point where he would say hello, and start a conversation with one of them, only to realize midway, that the person he was talking to wasn't Johansson. Ultimately, some scenes used CGI to hide Johansson's belly."", u'James Spader was Joss Whedon\'s first and only choice for the role of Ultron, because of his ""hypnotic voice that can be eerily calm and compelling, while also being very human and humorous"".', u'Because Ultron was eight to nine feet tall, the five-foot ten-inch James Spader had to wear an antenna-like contraption made out of a thick piece of wire, with two red balls attached to the top, that went up his entire back, and three feet above his head. This was done, so that the cast members that shared scenes with him, would have a reference point for where his eyes would be. The two red balls represented the placement of Ultron\'s eyes. Elizabeth Olsen stated that this was actually distracting, because Spader would be giving an intense performance, and out of instinct, she would look at him, rather than the balls representing his eyes. Much to everyone\'s amusement, whenever this happened, Aaron Taylor-Johnson would yell, ""Red balls!

However, he later signed on for Captain America: Civil War (2016).', u'Quicksilver\'s role in the film sparked wide discussion over his place in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The character had been discussed previously as a potential character in both X-Men: Viimeinen kohtaaminen (2006) and The Avengers (2012), but legal complexities resulted in his absence from both. But, in May 2013 Marvel Studios and 20th Century Fox announced a resolution to such issues, and that Quicksilver would appear in Age of Ultron, but only under specific parameters: no reference to his relations to the X-Men or Magneto (the character\'s father), and no reference to Quicksilver\'s membership in the Avengers could be made vice-versa. This went so far, that the character couldn\'t be referred to as a ""mutant"" in any Marvel film. Additionally, other debates between Fox and Marvel, led to two different versions of the same character, both of which are presented in two separate franchises.', u'Ultron recites ""No Strings On Me"", a song from Pinocchio (1940), a Walt Disney film about an inanimate being who gains sentience; Ultron serves as a dark parallel of Pinocchio.', u'It took Joss Whedon a year to convince Aaron Taylor-Johnson to accept the role of Quicksilver. Johnson was concerned over the intensity of the Marvel contracts, the time constraints, and the fact that it was going to be such a large cast. Even after he accepted the role, he was still nervous, but was comforted after he learned that his friend, and Godzilla (2014) co-star, Elizabeth Olsen, would be playing his sister, and would be his filming partner throughout most of the movie.', u'The trailer was viewed thirty-four million times on YouTube in the first twenty-four hours after it was released. This broke the record that was previously held by Iron Man 3 (2013).', u'James Spader uses his natural speaking voice for Ultron, with no accent or alteration of his voice.', u'In the comics, Ultron was created by Dr. Hank Pym (Ant-Man). In this film, Ultron is a dormant project developed by Tony Stark, while Pym gets his own separate story in Ant-Man (2015).', u'Joss Whedon cast Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch, because he thought their powers would be cool to use in a film: ""Their powers are very visually interesting. One of the problems I had on the first one, was everybody basically had punchy powers. Quicksilver\'s got super-speed, Scarlet Witch can weave spells, and a little telekinesis, get inside your head. That\'s good stuff they can do, that will help keep it fresh.""', u'Joss Whedon claimed that juggling all the characters in the film was ""a nightmare"": ""They\'re very disparate characters. The joy of the Avengers is they really don\'t belong in the same room. It\'s not like the X-Men, who are all tortured by the same thing, and have similar costumes. These guys are just all over the place, and so it\'s tough."" He was so exhausted with working on this film, that he decided not to direct the sequels Avengers: Infinity War (2018) and Untitled Avengers Movie (2019).', u'Industrial Light & Magic developed a new motion-capture system for the film, called ""Muse"", to better capture the actor\'s facial and body movements, and combine different takes of the same performance, with regards to Ultron and the Hulk. Andy Serkis (who also has the on-screen role of Ulysses Klaus) was brought on-board to contribute towards Muse\'s design and improvement. One major benefit of this work for the actor, was that in this film, Mark Ruffalo was able to do some of his Mo-Cap performance alongside his fellow cast members on-set, and on-location, as opposed to, in the first films, where he was working separately from the others. It furthermore reduced the amount of specific facial Mo-Cap sections, as they now were able to do both body and face simultaneously. (Source: The Graham Norton Show interview).', u'When Tony Stark goes to upload his new A.I. partner, F.R.I.D.A.Y. There is another drive labeled JOCASTA. JOCASTA, in the comics, was an A.I. created by Ultron, and her mind and body were modeled after Janet Van Dyne (The Wasp). She would eventually turn against Ultron, and join the Avengers.', u'According to Mark Ruffalo, his portrayal of the Hulk is inspired by Peter David\'s Hulk comics, where the Hulk and Bruce Banner were a split personality case: ""There\'s a very cool thing happening in the film: Hulk is as afraid of Banner, as Banner is afraid of Hulk. Both of these guys are obviously the same guy, and they have to come to peace somehow with each other, and this confrontation is building across this film.""', u'""Marvel Ultimates"" comic is famous for featuring a controversial incestuous storyline between Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch. According to Elizabeth Olsen, while this particular aspect would not be overtly present in the film, she and Aaron Taylor-Johnson ""played around"" with certain parts of it: ""Every time you see an image of them, they\'re always holding each other\'s hand and looking over each other\'s shoulder. They\'re always so close, it\'s almost uncomfortable. Aaron and I have been playing a little bit with those kinds of images just for ourselves.""', u'James Spader described Ultron as self-absorbed and immature: ""He sees the world from a very strange, biblical point of view, because he\'s brand new, he\'s very young. He\'s immature, and yet has knowledge of comprehensive, broad history and precedent, and he has created in a very short period of time, a rather skewed worldview.""', u'Hugh Jackman, who plays Wolverine in the X-Men films, has expressed an interest to play Wolverine in an Avengers sequel, despite the rights issues between Marvel and Fox over the X-Men. Jackman stated that he wanted to see Wolverine battle Iron Man. Rumors have spread recently, however, that Fox and Marvel met to discuss an unknown deal. This could potentially involve an agreement, similar to that between Sony and Marvel, which gives Marvel the ability to include Spider-Man in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Wolverine first appeared in the comics, as an enemy of the Hulk. During the Avengers vs. X-men comic book event, he was rivaled with Captain America.', u'The scene where Ultron commands his drones to fly down and latch themselves onto the truck in Seoul, took 360 days to complete. It was handled by only one animator, who upon completion of the scene, received a party, and a bottle of champagne for his efforts.', u""Cameo (Stan Lee): A Veteran at the Avengers' party, who takes a drink of Thor's ale.

He has played the Hulk in almost every live-action version since 1978: he played the Hulk in The Incredible Hulk (1978), and its subsequent three television specials, and he voiced the Hulk in the big-screen The Incredible Hulk (2008), in which he also played security guard. He also played a security guard in Hulk (2003). He has also voiced the Hulk in various animated productions.', u""Bruce Banner's creation that houses the extra Hulkbuster parts, Veronica, is named that, as an in-joke, based on the Archie comics.

Dr. Seuss."", u'The prelude to this film is on the mid-credits scene of Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014).', u'In comics, Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver are born mutants. In this movie, they got their powers due to experimentation of HYDRA on them. This change has to do with the fact that 20th Century Fox holds the rights to the X-Men films, and the whole mutant concept. Therefore this change was intended to disassociate the film from the X-Men film franchise, to avoid legal issues.', u'When Elizabeth Olsen and Aaron Taylor-Johnson learned that their roles Wanda and Pietro Maximoff would be based on their ""Marvel Ultimates"" version, they both read and studied every single issue, in order to prepare for the role.', u'The film was named after a 2013 Marvel comic series ""Age of Ultron"". However, Kevin Feige explained that that particular comic would not be used as a storyline: ""We came up with a few titles, but every month a new comic book appears, and \'Age Of Ultron\' is a great title. We had a few other \'Of Ultrons\', but that was the best one.

Taylor-Johnson was impressed by Hemsworth, saying, ""The only one who has an otherworldly superhero physique is Hemsworth. The size of his arms, is like the size of my thighs. Just to be an actor and transform your physique and body to that level, he\'s essentially a god.

As a result, Joss Whedon gathered the cast at the end of the day, and made them walk around the small Italian town, in which they were filming, while it snowed heavily, until he found an appropriate place for a party. They finally found a small club, and the cast, along with Whedon, danced until four in the morning.', u'Joss Whedon described this film as ""Smaller. More personal. More painful.

As Quicksilver is the first major protagonist to die in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, controversy has sparked about how he could have easily avoided such a fate. The reason Quicksilver did not do the same as his X-Men counterpart (and survive the attack) is partially because of the licensing agreement between Marvel and Fox, as no references to Quicksilver\'s affiliation with the X-Men could be made in a Marvel movie, and no references to his affiliation with the Avengers could be made in an X-Men movie. The other reason being that the Screenwriters for this movie, purposely shrank the scope of Quicksilver\'s powers, significantly limiting his capabilities, which also served to distinguish him from his X-Men doppelganger.', u'Foreshadowing Quicksilver\'s death, Captain America tells Hawkeye, Scarlet Witch, and Quicksilver that, ""If you get hurt, hurt \'em back, if you get killed, walk it off.""

Strangely enough, the robotic bodies seen earlier on before the title card, that later become Ultron\'s drones, share this same, asymmetrical aesthetic. In fact, the only one of Ultron\'s forms to sport a symmetrical appearance, is the body he has, by the time he meets Wanda and Pietro Maximoff in Sokovia, dubbed ""Ultron Prime"".', u'In the end of the movie, we can see the new Avengers: Scarlet Witch, Vision, Falcon, and War Machine.', u'Though each and every one of Ultron\'s forms throughout the film were named, they are never explicitly referred to as such. Ultron\'s mangled, broken body is never referred to as ""Ultron Mark 1"", his second body is never referred to as ""Ultron Prime"", his Vibranium-plated Prime body is never referred to as ""Ultimate Ultron"", and his drones are never referred to as ""Ultron Sentries"".', u""During Thor's vision of the Infinity Stones, that have appeared in the Marvel Universe, they line up in their crystal forms in front of a yellow nebula that bears a striking resemblance to the Infinity Gauntlet."", u""The Ultron Sentries are heavily based on Ultron's comic book variation. Their eyes and mouth glow blue, but when Ultron takes control of its body, their eyes turn red, closely resembling Ultron's comic book counterpart."", u'Both this film, and Thor (2011), have the hammer\'s ""worthiness"" as a fairly significant contribution to the plot. Only Thor can wield Mjollnir (the hammer) in Thor, while Thor and The Vision can wield it in this film. However, even though the worthiness is a large part of the hammer\'s story and involvement, in Thor: The Dark World (2013), it is hung on a coat hook and left. This technically deems the coat hook as ""worthy"", seeing as it is not on the floor when Thor goes to pick it up, unlike Quicksilver, who attempts holding it while running and is pulled backward by its sheer weight (and the fact he is not worthy).', u""In the second trailer, viewers might notice Black Widow carrying two rifles. Apparently, when the movie was released, she didn't wield those two rifles. Only one rifle was used by Bruce Banner, a.k.a. Hulk, in order to help Black Widow escape from her prison cell."", u'After the party in the Avengers\' tower, each Avenger, excluding Black Widow, try to lift the Mj\xf6lnir. According to Marvel Comics, on the hammer is written: ""Whosoever holds this hammer, if he be worthy, shall possess the power of Thor"", making Tony Stark\'s ""fingerprint"" theory somewhat correct.', u'When Quicksilver is shot by Ultron, he has about eight gunshot wounds all over his body. When he falls down next to Hawkeye, you can only see three gunshot wounds - one in the middle of his chest, one on his left arm, and one on his right leg.', u'Prior to the release of the film, people were wondering why the Hulk and Iron Man (in Hulkbuster armor) were fighting. One popular theory is that they were simply sparring to see who was stronger. Of course, in the final film, they were fighting because Scarlet Witch manipulated Hulk.', u'Originally, Quicksilver was never going to die. Also, we would have been introduced to Spider-Man and Captain Marvel in the end, with the New Avengers. However, they stuck with the scene in the film.', u'Throughout the whole movie, the Hulkbuster is referred to as ""Veronica"", and it is only mentioned three times. Once, when Tony was talking to Banner about creating Ultron. Once, after all of the team got mind-tricked by Scarlet Witch, and once mid-fight with the Hulk, when Tony asked for a hand.', u'While on the table, recovering from his injury, Hawkeye says he will be made of plastic, the doctor says, ""No Mr. Barton, it\'s made of you, even your own girlfriend won\'t know the difference"". He says ""I don\'t have a girlfriend"". Later on in the movie, we meet his wife.']","[u'USA::13 April 2015 (Los Angeles, California)\n (premiere)', u'Belgium::22 April 2015', u'Switzerland::22 April 2015 (French speaking region)', u'Switzerland::22 April 2015 (Italian speaking region)', u'Finland::22 April 2015', u'France::22 April 2015', u'Indonesia::22 April 2015', u'Italy::22 April 2015', u'Netherlands::22 April 2015', u'Norway::22 April 2015', u'Philippines::22 April 2015', u'Sweden::22 April 2015', u'Taiwan::22 April 2015', u'Albania::23 April 2015', u'Argentina::23 April 2015', u'Austria::23 April 2015', u'Australia::23 April 2015', u'Azerbaijan::23 April 2015', u'Brazil::23 April 2015', u'Belarus::23 April 2015', u'Switzerland::23 April 2015 (German speaking region)', u'Germany::23 April 2015', u'Denmark::23 April 2015', u'UK::23 April 2015', u'Georgia::23 April 2015', u'Hong Kong::23 April 2015', u'Ireland::23 April 2015', u'Israel::23 April 2015', u'Iceland::23 April 2015', u'South Korea::23 April 2015', u'Kazakhstan::23 April 2015', u'New Zealand::23 April 2015', u'Romania::23 April 2015', u'Russia::23 April 2015', u'Singapore::23 April 2015', u'Ukraine::23 April 2015', u'Bulgaria::24 April 2015', u'India::24 April 2015', u'Vietnam::24 April 2015', u'South Africa::24 April 2015', u'Egypt::29 April 2015', u'Spain::29 April 2015', u'Kuwait::29 April 2015', u'Portugal::29 April 2015', u'Trinidad and Tobago::29 April 2015', u'United Arab Emirates::30 April 2015', u'Bosnia and Herzegovina::30 April 2015', u'Chile::30 April 2015', u'Czech Republic::30 April 2015', u'Ecuador::30 April 2015', u'Greece::30 April 2015', u'Croatia::30 April 2015', u'Iraq::30 April 2015', u'Republic of Macedonia::30 April 2015', u'Mexico::30 April 2015', u'Malaysia::30 April 2015', u'Panama::30 April 2015', u'Peru::30 April 2015', u'Serbia::30 April 2015', u'Slovakia::30 April 2015', u'Thailand::30 April 2015', u'Bangladesh::1 May 2015', u'Bahamas::1 May 2015', u'Canada::1 May 2015', u'Colombia::1 May 2015', u'Cyprus::1 May 2015', u'Estonia::1 May 2015', u'Ethiopia::1 May 2015', u'Cambodia::1 May 2015', u'Sri Lanka::1 May 2015', u'Lithuania::1 May 2015', u'Latvia::1 May 2015', u'Pakistan::1 May 2015', u'Turkey::1 May 2015', u'USA::1 May 2015', u'Venezuela::1 May 2015', u'Hungary::7 May 2015', u'Poland::7 May 2015', u'China::12 May 2015', u'Japan::23 June 2015 (Tokyo)\n (premiere)', u'Japan::4 July 2015']"

The eagle head can actually be seen at the foot of the conference round table, at the end of the film, when repairs are being made.', u'Robert Downey Jr. initially pushed Joss Whedon to make Tony Stark the lead: ""I said, I need to be in the opening sequence, Tony needs to drive this thing.

We tried it, and it didn\'t work, because this is a different sort of thing, everybody is just an arm of the octopus.""', u'Joss Whedon suggested to Marvel, that there should be a bigger villain plotting behind-the-scenes, which enabled Loki to conquer the Earth, and that someone should be Thanos the Mad Titan.

In the comics, Captain America was unfrozen in Avengers #4, when he was accidentally discovered, when the team was looking for Namor the Sub Mariner.', u'Mark Ruffalo claims to be the only actor, to-date (2012), to play both The Hulk, and Bruce Banner in the same movie. Technically, both Eric Bana and Edward Norton had done motion-capture work for their respective Hulks, but Ruffalo is the first actor to perform the Hulk live on-set via performance capture. What is most certainly a confirmed ""first"" for Ruffalo\'s Hulk, however, is clearly defined chest hair (of which Ruffalo has plenty). That has absolutely never been done before in any portrayal of the Hulk, whether it be live, animated, or drawn.', u""As of 2013, this is the highest grossing film of all time not directed by James Cameron (Avengers is third under Titanic (1997)'s second place and Avatar (2009)'s first)."", u'(at around 1h 40 mins) Tony Stark describes his group as ""Earth\'s mightiest heroes, that kind of thing."" This refers to the famous tagline that has been featured on the cover of ""The Avengers"" comic books since its 1963 debut.

He has played the Hulk in almost every live-action version since 1978: he played the Hulk in the television series The Incredible Hulk (1978), and its subsequent three television specials. He voiced the Hulk in the big-screen The Incredible Hulk (2008), in which he also played a security guard. He also played a security guard in Hulk (2003).

Stanton is widely known for his role as Brett in Alien (1979).', u'The name ""chitauri"" originates from Zulu mythology, and is used to describe a ""serpent race from the sky."" Mark Millar, the creator of ""The Ultimates"", took the name from the writings of David Icke, who argues that these ""chitauri"", are in fact aliens, bent on dominating humanity.', u'Tony Stark\'s Acura roadster is neither the 2012 NSX Concept show car, nor an actual prototype of the 2015 next-generation hybrid Acura NSX. It was custom-designed specifically for the movie, by Honda North America Chief Designer Dave Marek. The ""donor car"" was a 1991 NSX from Arizona, with two hundred fifty-two thousand miles on its odometer.

Sayers suggested that the ""H"" stood for ""Hamish"", the Scottish equivalent of ""James"". In the film, Watson\'s middle name is ""Hamish"".', u'The slow-motion work in the film was done by Gavin Free, an English filmmaker who works for Rooster Teeth Productions, and is known for his web series, The Slow Mo Guys, on YouTube.', u'The text of the note that Holmes leaves Watson on the packing crate reads: ""Come at once if convenient. If inconvenient, come all the same."" This quote is taken directly from Holmes creator Sir Arthur Conan Doyle\'s short story ""The Adventure of the Creeping Man"".', u'The chess board motif runs through out the whole film, in either actual chess boards, or floors with black and white checkered squares.', u""Due to Warner Brothers' fast-tracking of this sequel, Director Guy Ritchie was forced to drop out of Lobo, while Robert Downey, Jr. was forced to drop out of Cowboys & Aliens (2011)."", u""In 2003, Stephen Fry appeared on the UK quiz show Celebrity Mastermind. His special subject was Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes, including a question on Mycroft Holmes. He chose this topic, because he loved Sherlock Holmes stories as a child, and at the age of ten, was the youngest member of London's Sherlock Holmes Appreciation Society."", u'In this film, Sherlock Holmes is thirty-seven years old. Robert Downey, Jr. was forty-six when this movie was released.', u'At the end of the train sequence, Watson says to Holmes, ""Once more unto the breach"". This is a line from a speech in Henry V by William Shakespeare. Much later in the play\'s speech, Henry V also exclaims, ""The game is afoot"", which Holmes used as a catchphrase in Sir Arthur Conan Doyle\'s stories.', u'At the beginning, when Watson is typing, the camera pans over typed excerpts from Sir Arthur Conan Doyle\'s stories, including ""The Blue Carbuncle"" and ""A Study in Scarlet"".', u""The series of numbers on Moriarty's blackboard (and seen again briefly during the notebook decoding sequence towards the end), is Pascal's triangle with the shallow diagonals marked, the sums of which form the Fibonacci sequence."", u'The bombmaker, Claude Ravache (Thierry Neuvic), was inspired by a real anarchist, Fran\xe7ois Claudius Koenigstein Ravachol, who was active until his execution in 1892.', u'Brad Pitt, Gary Oldman, Daniel Day-Lewis, Sean Penn, and Javier Bardem were considered to play Professor Moriarty.', u'Sophie Marceau, Audrey Tautou, Pen\xe9lope Cruz, Juliette Binoche, Virginie Ledoyen, Eva Green, Marion Cotillard, and C\xe9cile De France were considered to play Sim before Noomi Rapace was cast.', u""The advertisement for Lazenby's Soup Squares on the back of Moriarty's newspaper is for a real product of that era."", u'Stephen Fry (Mycroft Holmes) and Jared Harris (Professor Moriarty) share the same birthday.', u'Stephen Fry also appear in The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug (2013) and The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies (2014).

Whether Downey knew it or not, in ""The Adventure of the Mazarin Stone"" Holmes is said to have disguised himself as an old woman.', u'Sherlock defeats Moriarty by pulling him over Reichenbach Falls, with both of them falling to their apparent deaths. Holmes is later shown to have survived. In Sir Arthur Conan Doyle\'s story ""The Final Problem"" (intended to be the final Sherlock Holmes story), Holmes defeated Moriarty in the same way, by falling over a waterfall to the apparent death of both. However, in response to overwhelming public demand, Doyle wrote another story and resurrected Holmes.', u'In Holmes\' final struggle with Moriarty, he uses a two-handed clasp to immobilize Moriarty before going over the falls. In the 1903 short story ""The Adventure of the Empty House"", Holmes does not specify the specifics of the fight, but the illustrator of the story, Sidney Paget, drew Holmes in the same unique grasp that Robert Downey, Jr. used in the film.', u'Watson\'s voice-over speech during Sherlock Holmes\' funeral was taken almost word for word from the story ""The Final Problem"", in which Sherlock Holmes ""dies"" pulling Moriarty over a cliff with him.', u'The medals Watson wears during his stag party are the Afghan War Medal (red and green ribbon) and the Kandahar Bronze Star (multi-colored striped ribbon), which would make Watson a veteran of the Second Afghan War (1878-1880).', u""During the scene in which Holmes, Watson, and Sim (Noomi Rapace) are to travel across the border on horseback, but Holmes opts to ride a pony, the soundtrack becomes an homage to that from Kourallinen dynamiittia (1970), in which Shirley MacLaine's character chooses to ride a burro, while Clint Eastwood rides a horse."", u'The chess game between Holmes and Moriarty was based on a real match between Bent Larsen and Tigran Petrosian in 1966 in Santa Monica. The game had a Queen sacrifice, and discovered checkmate to win the game. The opening moves are slightly different, and the colors have been reversed though.', u'The movie is primarily based on the short story ""The Final Problem"" by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (and to a lesser extent on ""The Empty House""), but also shows aspects from other Sherlock Holmes stories: ""The Sign of Four"" (introduction of Watson\'s fianc\xe9e); ""The Greek Interpreter"" (introduction of Mycroft Holmes); ""Valley of Fear"" (explanation of Moriarty\'s underworld empire); ""The Speckled Band""; ""The Dying Detective""; ""Bruce Partington Plans""; and ""The Second Stain"".', u""The bagpipers at Dr. Watson's wedding were from the Leicestershire Seaforth Highlanders. Guy Ritchie contacted them as his grandfather was in the Seaforth Highlanders."", u'The opera that the characters visit in Paris is ""Don Giovanni"", by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. The scene being played, is the finale of Act II. In it, the villain and seducer Don Giovanni is visited by the animated statue of one of his victims, who drags him to Hell when he refuses to repent.', u'In Sherlock Holmes (2009), Sherlock refers to he and Watson attending Don Giovanni, the same play that is the focus of the events in Paris in this film.', u""The world's last sea-going paddle steamer, the P.S.

Holmes, ""You know that what you\'re drinking is for eye surgery?"", is an obscure reference to Holmes\' cocaine usage. At the time, cocaine was used as a topical anesthetic for eye surgery.

This was done before the official casting of Jared Harris as Moriarty in he film's sequel, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows (2011).

The key moment where Holmes punches his opponent's jaw, was filmed one second in real-time, and turned into a seven-second shot without additional post-production aid."", u'The film depicts Watson pressing Holmes to meet his fianc\xe9e, Mary Morstan. Holmes is reluctant to do so. In the original stories by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Mary Morstan is introduced as a client (in the novel ""The Sign of Four""). She and Watson fall in love while he assists Holmes in her case, and he proposes to her at the end of the novel.', u'In the stories, Holmes is described to be an expert in Baritsu. In the film, however, the martial art that Holmes used is the Wing-Chun Kung Fu (famously used by Ip Man Yee and Bruce Lee). Robert Downey, Jr. is a practitioner of the art in real-life, and the fight scene between him and David Garrick at Punch Bowl Pit was coordinated with the help of his trainer.', u""Despite Moriarty's obsession with the Blackwood Device, and saying how it is crucial to his plans, it plays absolutely no important part in Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows (2011)."", u'After examining Lord Blackwood\'s coffin, the line that Holmes and Watson deliver in unison, ""The game\'s afoot; follow your spirit: and upon this charge, cry--God for Harry! England and Saint George!"" is from William Shakespeare\'s play Henry V.', u'The film contains numerous references and allusions to the Sir Arthur Conan Doyle novels and stories. Including: ""The game is afoot."" (""The Abbey Grange"", as well as the original source of the phrase, William Shakespeare\'s ""Henry V""); ""Because I was looking for it."" (""Silver Blaze""); ""You have the grand gift of silence, Watson. It makes you quite invaluable as a companion."" (""The Man with the Twisted Lip""); ""Crime is common, logic is rare."" (""The Adventure of the Copper Beeches""); ""My mind rebels at stagnation. Give me problems, give me work.""

Five is also the number of women that the bulk of historians agree were murdered by Jack the Ripper (additional victims are disputed).', u'Although Irene Adler plays a large role in the movie (and works of fiction by ""Baker Street irregulars""), she only appears in one Sir Arthur Conan Doyle story, ""A Scandal in Bohemia"", briefly referenced in the movie. Holmes retains the portrait of Irene Adler acquired for his services in that story and also once refers to her as ""the woman"" as he does in the latter story.', u'Robert Downey, Jr. read many Sherlock Holmes stories and watched The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (1984) in order to learn more about the character.', u'When Sherlock says ""Now that you\'re sitting comfortably, I shall begin."" to begin explaining Blackwood\'s plot, it is a reference to a BBC children\'s radio program from the 1950s, Listen With Mother, which was famous for its opening line ""Are you sitting comfortably? Then I\'ll begin.""', u'The story ""The Adventure of the Musgrave Ritual"" mentions that Holmes practiced shooting his pistol by putting VR (Victoria Regina) on his wall with bullet holes. In the movie, Holmes shoots VR in the wall in his room with a gun.', u'The scene in which Holmes and Watson make a series of deductions from a dead man\'s watch closely mirrors a similar sequence in ""The Sign of the Four"" (as does Holmes\' ability to follow the carriage\'s path whilst blindfolded), in which Holmes uses nearly identical observations (scratches around the watch\'s keyhole, pawnbroker\'s marks on the inside of the case) to deduce information from a watch belonging to Watson\'s late brother. Holmes\'s passing reference to locking Watson\'s checkbook in his desk parallels a similar statement in ""The Adventure of the Dancing Men"", which commentators such as William S. Baring-Gould have taken to mean that Watson had a gambling problem, an interpretation that the film adopts. Holmes also uses a riding crop as a weapon throughout the film, as he does in ""A Case of Identity"". In the ""Six Napoleons"", it is described as his ""favorite weapon"".', u'The four symbols, to which are referred, in the movie, the Man, the Lion, the Ox, and the Eagle, are also attributed to the four Gospels of the Christian Bible: Matthew (Man, the humanity of Christ), Mark (Lion, for courage and for action), Luke (Ox, for strength and perseverance), and John (Eagle, for clarity of sight and for divinity).', u'The first Sherlock Holmes film to reach U.S. movie theaters in over twenty years, since the 1988 comedy Without a Clue (1988) with Michael Caine as Reginald Kincaid/""Sherlock Holmes"".', u'Lord Blackwood\'s ""final"" words, ""Death is only the beginning"", are the same words that were carved in Imhotep\'s sarcophagus in The Mummy (1999).', u'The bare-knuckle fight between Holmes and McMurdo references the Holmes story ""The Sign of Four"".

Don\'t you remember that amateur who fought three rounds with you at Alison\'s rooms on the night of your benefit four years back?""', u'Mary asks Watson if she could read his journals of his adventures with Sherlock Holmes. Of the sixty Sir Arthur Conan Doyle-penned stories of Sherlock Holmes, all but four have Watson serving as the narrator.

The first is the name of the primary antagonist, Lord Blackwood, which parallels that of ""Mazarin Stone"" villain Count Negretto Sylvius (Negretto is Italian for black, and Sylvius is Latin for woods). (As Holmes scholar W. W. Roberts notes, this is ""presumably a private joke at the expense of Blackwood\'s Magazine, long and unavailingly courted by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle in the 1880s."") Another common detail is the Crown Diamond, an alternate name for the Mazarin Stone, which hangs around Irene Adler\'s neck in the film. ""The Mazarin Stone"" is also the first story to mention that the 221B Baker Street apartment had multiple exits and a waiting room. The extra exit, which was through the bedroom, is employed by Holmes to follow Irene early in the film.', u'Colin Farrell was in talks to play Watson, before Jude Law was cast.', u'Sam Worthington was considered for the role of Watson.', u'After Holmes recreates the ritual on his own, as he describes it to Watson and Irene Adler, he holds his spotted stick to his forehead for a few seconds. This is a reference to the story ""The Speckled Band"", in which a speckled snake wraps itself around the villain\'s head and bites him.', u'Jude Law previously appeared in the Granada television series The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes (1991), in The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes: Shoscombe Old Place (1991).', u'The song that plays from 1:03 to the end on the second trailer is a piece called ""Unstoppable"" by the group E.S.

This is a coincidence as Clive Russel goes on to play 'The Blackfish' in HBO's Game of Thrones."", u'The Celtic music playing during the ""Meat and Potatoes"" fight scene is actually the AC/DC song Thunderstruck. It stops when they are in the boat area.', u'Robert Downey, Jr. and Jude Law have worked with other actors who played Holmes and Watson. Downey appears in Avengers: Infinity War (2018) with Benedict Cumberbatch, Captain America: Civil War (2016) with Martin Freeman, Iron Man 3 (2013) with Sir Ben Kingsley, and The Judge (2014) with Robert Duvall. Law appeared on the 1980s Sherlock Holmes series that starred Jeremy Brett as Sherlock, and David Burke and Edward Hardwicke as Watson; Breaking and Entering (2006) with Martin Freeman, A.I. Artificial Intelligence (2001) with Sir Ben Kingsley; and Hugo (2011) with both Kingsley and Sir Christopher Lee.

The first was a burial crime scene (Earth), second was drowning (water), third was immolation (fire), and fourth was poison gas (air).', u'Guy Ritchie has stated in interviews that he is a fan (and a practitioner) of Brazilian Jiu-jitsu, made popular in mixed martial arts. Towards the end of the movie, Holmes and Watson fight Dredger, and finally manage to subdue him with an arm-bar and a modified rear naked choke, both popular Brazilian Jiu-jitsu submissions.', u'In the newspaper with the headline ""London In Terror: Blackwood Lives and the Devil Walks With Him"", handed by Lestrade to Holmes when Holmes is bailed out, the names of the five women who were Blackwood\'s first five victims are revealed. They are: Susan Willis, Margaret Coile, June Gray, Mary Wilson, and Sarah Moss. The woman, on whose murder Holmes intervened, is revealed to be named as Beatrice Church.', u'All events take place in the year 1891. After Holmes and Watson are released from custody following the events in the shipyard, Inspector Lestrade hands a newspaper (""The National Police Gazette"") over to Holmes. The title on the newspaper is ""London In Terror"", and the date is Friday, November 19, 1891, but oddly the first newspaper, foretelling Blackwoods hanging, given to Holmes by Watson in his apartment is dated Novemeber 13, 1890. This sets the story during the period when, in the original Sir Arthur Conan Doyle stories, Holmes was believed dead. According to ""The Final Problem"", Holmes and Professor Moriarty apparently plunged to their deaths over the Reichenbach Falls in May 1891. Holmes did not reveal he had survived until the spring of 1894, as described in ""The Adventure of the Empty House"".', u'When Sherlock and Watson visit Blackwood\'s grave, Sherlock says ""And on the third day..."" - a reference to Jesus as he rose from the dead on the third day.']","[u'UK::14 December 2009 (London)\n (premiere)', u'Bahrain::24 December 2009', u'Hong Kong::24 December 2009', u'Croatia::24 December 2009', u'South Korea::24 December 2009', u'Kuwait::24 December 2009', u'Malaysia::24 December 2009', u'Portugal::24 December 2009', u'Singapore::24 December 2009', u'Thailand::24 December 2009', u'Canada::25 December 2009', u'Switzerland::25 December 2009 (Italian speaking region)', u'Denmark::25 December 2009', u'Israel::25 December 2009', u'Italy::25 December 2009', u'Latvia::25 December 2009', u'USA::25 December 2009', u'Australia::26 December 2009', u'UK::26 December 2009', u'Ireland::26 December 2009', u'Iceland::26 December 2009', u'Norway::26 December 2009', u'New Zealand::26 December 2009', u'Indonesia::27 December 2009', u'Egypt::30 December 2009', u'Kazakhstan::31 December 2009', u'Russia::31 December 2009', u'Ukraine::31 December 2009', u'Bulgaria::1 January 2010', u'Lithuania::1 January 2010', u'Mexico::1 January 2010', u'Panama::1 January 2010', u'Romania::1 January 2010', u'Sweden::1 January 2010', u'Belgium::6 January 2010', u'Czech Republic::7 January 2010', u'Hungary::7 January 2010', u'Netherlands::7 January 2010', u'Peru::7 January 2010', u'Slovenia::7 January 2010', u'Brazil::8 January 2010', u'Estonia::8 January 2010', u'India::8 January 2010', u'Philippines::8 January 2010', u'Argentina::11 January 2010 (Buenos Aires)\n (premiere)', u'Argentina::14 January 2010', u'Greece::14 January 2010', u'Spain::15 January 2010', u'Poland::15 January 2010', u'Turkey::15 January 2010', u'Finland::22 January 2010', u'Switzerland::28 January 2010 (German speaking region)', u'Germany::28 January 2010', u'Syria::28 January 2010', u'Austria::29 January 2010', u'Switzerland::3 February 2010 (French speaking region)', u'France::3 February 2010', u'China::25 February 2010', u'Japan::28 February 2010 (Yubari International Fantastic Film Festival)', u'Japan::12 March 2010', u'Vietnam::31 December 2012']"

However, the word is used once when Samuel Sterns warns Blonsky that the mix of Banner\'s mutated DNA with Blonsky\'s injection ""could be... an abomination.""', u'A scene where a hopeless Bruce Banner arrives at the Arctic to commit suicide was featured in the trailer, but was deemed too sensitive for young viewers, and was removed from the film.', u'In the comics, Emil Blonsky takes on a scaly reptilian appearance, becoming the Abomination. Louis Leterrier felt that while that was cool, it made no sense, considering there was no reptile mix in his origin. So, in this film, Blonsky\'s appearance is redefined substantially, to have his skin, muscles, and bones exaggerated, and sticking out all over his body. Leterrier describes Blonsky as ""an uber-human, just like the Hulk, but a human who was injected with something in the wrong places, and these places are growing differently."" The Visual Effects Artists think of Blonsky as ""a guy who transforms, but is not used to having these new properties.

On-set, he constantly asked whether this would ""be a cool shot"", in which his kids to see him. He thoroughly enjoyed playing Blonsky, but found it difficult, since to portray Blonsky\'s over-the-hill state, he could not work out, but he hired a personal trainer to assist him in motion-capturing the Abomination\'s movements.', u'This is the fourth film where Edward Norton plays a character with an alter ego, following Primal Fear (1996), Fight Club (1999), and The Score (2001).', u'In the Bruce Jones Hulk comics, Betty Ross aided Bruce Banner, as a shadowy contact under the alias ""Mr. Blue"". Mr. Blue appears in this film, but is revealed to be Samuel Sterns.

In the early Hulk issues, Banner\'s name evolved from David Banner, to Bob Banner, and finally settled at Bruce Banner. When the changes were pointed out in the letter columns, Marvel (and it may have been Stan Lee) ""explained"" the changes saying that his full name was something like David Bob Bruce Banner, and he chose to go by Bruce.', u'In this film , Bruce (Edward Norton) learns to control his anger partially through martial arts training. The martial arts instructor who (with Bruce\'s permission) slaps him a couple times during training, is played by renowned Brazilian Jiu-jitsu Grandmaster Rickson Gracie, whose family were the founders of Brazilian Jiu-jitsu. In Brazil, it is called: ""Gracie Jiu-jitsu"". However, his role is named in the credits as an ""Aikido Instructor.""

This was particularly due to Marvel using their characters as collateral when they received a five hundred twenty-five million dollar, seven year deal, called a non-recourse debt facility, allowing them to make original films based on their properties. Marvel wanted to have complete creative control over their characters, build a film library, and greater profit potential than the deals they've inked with other studios owning the film rights to their characters. Marvel also changed its name to Marvel Entertainment, Incorporated, to establish a Hollywood presence. If the film didn't succeed, Marvel would've lost the intellectual property rights to their library."", u'When designing Tony Stark\'s house, the guideline the designers were given was to make it more ""grease monkey"" (inventor and mechanic) than futuristic, in order to keep the film realistic.

However, the comic version of Raza is not an enemy of Iron Man, but an alien cyborg, who is a member of the space pirate gang known as the Starjammers. The only similarity they share, is their facial disfigurement. In the comics, Raza has implants on the left side of his face, while in the film, Raza is scarred on the right side of his face.', u""According to Ramin Djawadi, Tony Stark's different moods, as performed by Robert Downey Jr., was the inspiration for the Iron Man scores in the film."", u'According to the January 2012 Air & Space Magazine, Tony Starks\'s character was also inspired by South African born SpaceX (and PayPal co-founder), Elon Musk.

Two years later, it hadn't moved on so Tom Cruise tried to kickstart a production, to the extent of commissioning a script by Stan Lee and Jeff Vintar. Jeffrey Caine then did a polish on the screenplay. Still nothing. In 1999, Quentin Tarantino was approached to see if he could move things along but that too came to nothing. The rights moved to New Line in 2000 with Ted Elliott, Terry Rossio and Tim McCanlies writing a screenplay (this version even featured a cameo by Nick Fury).

However, the Audi R8 was so well-built, that it refused to flip, despite repeated crashes and the roof wouldn't split the way Jon Favreau wanted it to, because the car's frame was so tough. As a result, the whole final fight sequence was re-written. The filmmakers were so impressed by the toughness of the car, that it was decided that the convertible version was to be featured in Iron Man 2 (2010)."", u'Brian Michael Bendis had written three pages of dialogue for the Nick Fury scene, out of which the filmmakers chose the best lines. To keep it a secret, the scene was filmed with a skeleton crew, and was omitted from all previews of the film, which thus maintained the mystery and surprise, and kept fans speculative and interested. It conclusively appeared in the final cut as a post-credits scene.', u'In the Ultimate Marvel Comics series, the character of Nick Fury is portrayed as African-American, with his look and personality tailored after Samuel L. Jackson, all carried out with Jackson\'s explicit permission. During one of the Ultimate Avengers issues, while discussing the possibility of a movie being made about them, and which actors would play which heroes, Nick Fury comments that nobody else but Samuel L. Jackson could play him. Jackson, himself a comic book fan, plays Fury in this film.

Rhodey dons this suit in Iron Man 2 (2010), becoming War Machine.', u'According to Jeff Bridges, Obadiah Stane was originally supposed to survive the final battle against Tony, with the heroes opening up his destroyed suit to find that there was no corpse inside. Presumably this would have poised Stane to return for future movies.', u'at around 1h 55 mins) Shortly into the credits sequence, there is an animation of the Ten Rings logo. This refers to the terrorist group that captures Tony Stark early in the film, but is not actually acknowledged. It is, however, commonly acknowledged in Iron Man 3 (2013).', u""According to Jon Favreau, it was difficult to find a proper opponent for Iron Man to face, since he wanted the film to remain grounded in reality as much as possible. It was decided to have a foe in the film who would serve as a parallel of Stark (for example, an armored opponent). Well-known enemies like the Titanium Man and the Crimson Dynamo were considered, but finally the lesser-known Iron Monger, Obadiah Stane, was chosen as Iron Man's adversary (Stane, as well as possessing his own armor, is also a business contemporary of Stark)."", u""The climactic showdown in the film, with Tony Stark, a.k.a. Iron Man, facing Obadiah Stane, a.k.a. Iron Monger, is based on Iron Man #200 (November 1986).

In the case of Warner Brothers, their 1969 releases did not use their classic shield as depicted here, but instead carried a ""Warner Bros.-Seven Arts"" logo, used when the studio had merged with Ray Stark and Eliot Hyman\'s production company, Seven Arts.

It\'s quite likely that members of the cast and/or crew of the film were familiar with the Santa Monica restaurant and used it as an art model for the San Francisco locale. The ""Dirty Harry"" reference inherent in the Diner\'s name may simply be an added plus.', u'Toschi flies to Riverside on PSA (Pacific Southwest Airlines).

The shell of the quahog clam (Mercenaria mercenaria) is the official Rhode Island State shell. A quahog is a pretty standard looking clam, except that it\'s big, about the size of a grown man\'s hand. Rhode Islanders like to eat them in clam chowder (not white chowder, but clear, made without milk). They also stuff the clams with a bread and clam stuffing, and serve them for dinner. The area\'s Native Americans, the Narragansetts, called them ""quahog"", which means simply ""clam"". They used the purple part of the shells to make wampum, which was traded by Native American tribes throughout North America.', u'Brian has a tattoo of the comic character Ziggy.', u'The series began airing in high definition with Family Guy: And Then There Were Fewer (2010).

James Woods is from Warwick, Rhode Island, and Vincent ""Buddy"" Cianci, Jr. is the former Mayor of Providence, Rhode Island.', u'The original idea for titles of episodes were supposed to be based on 1940s Mystery Radio shows. This is why the first few episodes have some sort of reference to death in them. Eventually the writers of the show had to start describing the episodes to one another (rather than simply using the titles), so that idea was dropped.', u'Before Seth MacFarlane created the idea of a regular half-hour series, he conceived of the Griffin family appearing as characters in animated shorts to appear on MADtv (1995). Many of the regular voice actors (including Alex Borstein, Phil LaMarr, Debra Wilson and Nicole Sullivan) are MADtv alumni. Alex Borstein was the first cast on this show and is the only ""official"" cast member as the voice of Lois Griffin.', u'In the early seasons, in the opening credits, the pictures on the wall of Chris, Meg, and Stewie, in the background, have blurred faces.

She played Mon Mothma, ironically for her role as Princess Leia.', u'Stewie\'s favorite song is ""Hungry Eyes"" by Eric Carmen.', u""In early episodes of the series, the rest of the family can seemingly hear what Stewie says.

The right side (his right) buttons over the left. On men's shirts it's the other way around."", u""On Family Guy: Love Thy Trophy (2000), Stewie's ABC blocks pyramidally spell REDRUM, a reference to Stephen King's novel and Stanley Kubrick's movie The Shining (1980), where REDRUM was MURDER spelled backwards. Which is what Stewie plans to do to Lois."", u'In season seven, episode fourteen, ""We Love You, Conrad"", Stewie tells Brian that Bruce Jenner is a woman.

Including Avatar's Creator Michael Dante DiMartino."", u'Many of the KEN conference attendees in Dumb and Dumber To (2014) are played by writers of the series.', u'On at least one occasion, Quagmire references a porno channel called ""Skin-A-Max"" (a nickname for Cinemax, due to their late night ""Adults Only"" programming). The name ""Skin-A-Max"" was first used by Seth Green in Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery (1997) , who, of course, plays Chris Griffin on this show.', u""In one episode, Party of Five (1994) is mentioned, and Peter asks if that's a porno.

The Kool-Aid Man, mascot for the beverage Kool-Aid, often breaks through a wall after multiple utterances of the phrase ""oh no!"", whereas he says ""oh yeah!"".

Additionally, before the original Kraft split into two companies, the Nabisco subdivision\'s Wheat Thins had an advertisement series featuring Brian and Stewie.

A week later, he received the screenplay for this film, and agreed to do it before he'd even finished reading it. Upon agreeing, and much to his delight, he was informed that Downey had already been cast."", u'The film was given a standing ovation at the Cannes Film Festival.', u'Val Kilmer had to quickly lose the fifty pounds gained for his plump role in Alexander (2004), in order to play his fit GQ character for this film.', u'The film was originally titled ""L.A.P.I."", then ""Bang!"", but Val Kilmer suggested to Director Shane Black that ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" would have more appeal.', u""Val Kilmer's depiction of Gay Perry is generally considered to be the first openly gay character to front a Hollywood action movie."", u""Val Kilmer walked around in a five hundred dollar pair of Louis Vuitton driving shoes, and wore nail varnish, while experimenting with several variations of speech patterns for the role. Kilmer also noted this was done much to his son Jack's chagrin."", u""Shane Black had been suffering from writer's block. It ultimately took him over a year and a half to write the script for this film. He then had enormous trouble trying to sell it. His former cachet, as being the highest paid screenwriter, meant nothing when he was shopping his screenplay around. Eventually, he took it to Producer Joel Silver, who gave him his first break back in 1987 when he bought Lethal Weapon."", u""The film grossed far more outside the U.S., accounting for just over seventy percent of the film's worldwide gross."", u""Co-Producer of the film, Susan Downey (Susan Levin), is Robert Downey, Jr.'s wife."", u'Joel Silver noted that the film was originally budgeted at ten million dollars, because Warner Brothers was not confident in the premise. The film ran over, and the final budget was fifteen million dollars. Warner Brothers loved the film when it was screened, and immediately opened it at the 2005 Cannes International Film Festival in a high-profile capacity.', u'Warner Brothers was willing to produce the movie with a larger budget, if Harrison Ford was to play the detective. When he passed on it, several other options were briefly considered before Val Kilmer was offered the role.', u'The movie shares its title with a song from the soundtrack of the James Bond movie Thunderball (1965). ""Mr. Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" was recorded first by Shirley Bassey, and then Dionne Warwick after Composer John Barry had chosen the title when he read a magazine article which mentioned that was how Bond was known in Italy. However, the producers got cold feet at the last moment, and asked him to write a title song, ""Thunderball"", which was performed by Tom Jones. KKBB was relegated to an instrumental-only status within the movie. Both versions of ""Mr. Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" were released many years later, and ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" has since become a slang description of the James Bond-style spy genre.', u""Shane Black's directorial debut."", u'Shane Black read several stories by Raymond Chandler when writing this script. As a result, the story is divided into chapters and the chapter titles come from Chandler works. Specifically: 1. ""Trouble is My Business"", 2. ""The Lady in the Lake"", 3. ""The Little Sister"", 4. ""The Simple Art of Murder"", and Epilogue: ""Farewell, My Lovely"".', u'One scene in the film takes place in a club exhibiting living art, which, at one point in his life, Robert Downey, Jr. worked as.', u'The film\'s original title was ""You\'ll Never Die in This Town Again"". When Harmony is seen on the bus leaving Indiana at age sixteen, she\'s asleep with the Johnny Gossamer book, ""You\'ll Never Die in This Town Again"" in her lap.', u'Because of its modest budget, Warner Brothers granted Joel Silver the distinction of overseeing the film personally, allowing Shane Black to only have to answer to him, instead of numerous studio heads.', u'Johnny Knoxville was set to star as Harry Lockhart, before being replaced by Robert Downey, Jr.', u'Although the film leads us to believe that the characters played by Robert Downey, Jr. and Michelle Monaghan grew up together, there is an eleven year age difference between them.', u'Robert Downey, Jr. composed music for his first music album during the production.', u""The opening part, taking place at Harlan Dexter's mansion, was shot at Shane Black's mansion. In the years between Black's last produced feature, The Long Kiss Goodnight (1996), and this one, Black had become infamous for throwing similar large, extravagant parties at that mansion, filled with the same kind of industry big-wigs and up-and-comers."", u'In reference to the ""Ike, Mike, and Mustard"" quote, Ike and Mike are diner slang for salt and pepper shakers. Also, pre-1950s, an ""Ike, Mike, and Mustard"" joke was an off color joke, generally with sexual references, that wouldn\'t be told in polite or mixed company.', u'WRITER TRADEMARK: (Shane Black): (disarmed gunman): While being held at gunpoint, Gay Perry demonstrates how easy it is to disarm a non-professional gunman, as most of them fail to keep a minimum distance of five feet from their targets. Shane Black often writes scenes where the hero is able to disarm a gunman who makes this mistake, most notably in The Last Boy Scout (1991) and The Long Kiss Goodnight (1996).', u'Gay Perry\'s cell phone ringtone is ""I Will Survive"" by Gloria Gaynor.', u""Robert Downey, Jr.'s favorite movie of his own."", u'Harry\'s (Robert Downey, Jr.\'s) game of Russian roulette, while asking the suspect ""Where is the girl?"" is a mirror of a Russell Crowe scene from L.A. Confidential (1997).', u'In its initial release, this never expanded beyond one hundred sixty-nine screens, hence its disappointing box-office numbers.', u'The phrase ""kiss kiss, bang bang"" appeared in the 1960s as an overseas slang for spy movies, especially James Bond movies. It was popular in Europe and Japan. It first appeared as a film title for Kiss Kiss - Bang Bang (1966), a 1966 spy comedy made in Spain with Italian financing. It was also the title of famed critic Pauline Kael\'s second published collection of reviews. Kael wrote that she chose the words as her title because they are ""perhaps the briefest statement imaginable of the basic appeal of movies.""', u'In one scene, Harry Lockhart is prompted to read lines from a script sample. The first line he reads ends with the phrase ""go spit"", which is also a catchphrase of Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover) in the Lethal Weapon movies.', u""According to the DVD commentary track, Robert Downey, Jr. had one of Shane Black's assistants crouching off camera jabbing him in the kidneys during the torture scene."", u'Early in production, Warner Brothers considered Benicio Del Toro for Harry, and Hugh Grant for Gay Perry.', u'Harmony\'s baseball bat carries the inscription ""Wonder Girl"", which is an homage to Robert Redford\'s bat in The Natural (1984), which was called ""Wonder Boy"".', u""The first film produced by Public Media Works, Corbin Bernsen's production company."", u'The (published) name of the author of the Jonny Gossamer books is Joe Chester. You can see it briefly on the first book Harmony picks up at the party.', u'At one point in the film, Gay Perry reveals that Colin Farrell is up for the role, for which Harry is auditioning.

In the movie, Grady applies the term ""Wonder Boy"" to James specifically.

Before the auction, the suit's value was placed at twenty thousand dollars."", u""Bearing in mind the film's interest in Marilyn Monroe, the character of Miss Antonia Sloviak, a tuba-playing transvestite, may be a nod to Monroe's film Some Like It Hot (1959), in which two men disguise themselves as women, and pose as members of an all-female band.

Because of the logistics of the scene, no safety net or airbag could be used, making it a one time only shot. It took ten weeks to plan the shot, and eight hours to set it up. It lasts for seven seconds in the film.', u'Wesley Snipes disliked shooting scenes where he is in water (of which there are two in the film), as he cannot swim.', u'Towards the end of the production shoot, the cast and crew had to wait several days without filming, waiting for Robert Downey, Jr. to show up and finish the movie. The only scenes left to shoot, were the hospital scenes, and there was no way to shoot without him there. He finally did show up and finish his scenes, apparently without the need for an explanation, or an apology to those who waited.', u'When Sheridan (Wesley Snipes) rents his apartment across from the U.N. building, he tells the landlord, ""It\'s perfect"". This is the same line used by Richard Kimble (Harrison Ford) when he rents an apartment in The Fugitive (1993).', u""In the original script, Samuel Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones) was introduced dressed up as a priest. Stuart Baird and Costume Designer Louise Frogley didn't find this interesting enough, so they came up with the idea of the chicken outfit."", u'For shooting the scenes on the plane, Director Stuart Baird and Production Designer Maher Ahmad looked at real prisoner transfer planes, but were disappointed to find that they looked just like regular planes. As such, they came up with the design of the plane seen in the film - the feet restraints, the cage door, the mechanical locking system, the open toilet, et cetera.', u'For shooting the scene of the airplane crash, the production leased a real Boeing 727 from a Las Vegas casino owner, purchased two fuselages for the post-crash scenes, and built a one thousand pound model for the actual moment of impact. The scene of the crash was shot on a miniature road twelve hundred feet long, with the one thousand-pound model plane moving at sixty miles per hour. Because it was a one shot only situation, it was filmed by nine cameras. The sequence was primarily directed by Visual Effects Supervisor Peter Donen, and in total, the entire scene took seventy-five people six months to bring it all together.', u""All of the interiors of the Marshal's offices were shot on the twentieth floor of 444 North Michigan Avenue in Chicago, which was the same location that was used for shooting the interiors of the offices in The Fugitive (1993)."", u'The jet plane that was crashed in this movie, is now located in a flooded rock quarry near Mermet, Illinois. The quarry is a dive park for scuba divers.', u'In the bar scene at the beginning of the movie, the U.S. Marshal crew is watching themselves on television. The reporter throws it back to ""Lester"", better known now as NBC\'s Lester Holt, who was at that time the anchor at Chicago\'s WBBM. Lester Holt was also in The Fugitive (1993), the movie to which this is a sequel.', u'Robert Downey, Jr. did not enjoy working on the production, and in an interview shortly after its release, he said of the film ""It\'s possibly the worst action movie of all time, and that\'s just not good for the maintenance of a good spiritual condition. You\'ve had a traumatic year, you\'ve been practically suicidal, what do you think would be really healing for you? How about like twelve weeks of running around as Johnny Handgun? I think that if you talk to a spirit guide, they would say, \'That\'ll kill you.\' I thought maybe there was something I was missing, and what I really needed to do was to be in one of those films that I love taking my kid to. But it wound up being really depressing. I\'d rather wake up in jail for a TB test than have to wake up another morning knowing I\'m going to the set of U.S. Marshals.""', u'For the scene in which the Marshals are following Chen (Michael Paul Chan), over seven hundred extras were used.', u'The pilot of the 727 is played by Steve King, a real life pilot.', u'The cemetery scene, which is clearly set in New York City in the film, and is also referred to as ""Queens Hill Cemetery"" by Gerard on his radio, is actually Bohemian Cemetery in Chicago.', u'Special Agent John Royce\'s (Robert Downey, Jr.\'s) ""sissy nickel pistol"" is a Taurus PT945 .45 caliber handgun. Tommy Lee Jones is holding one on the poster despite the fact that he doesn\'t use it in the movie, but instead uses a Glock.', u'Samuel L. Jackson was originally cast as Mark Sheridan.', u'The swamp scenes were shot on Reelfoot Lake in northwest Tennessee, in the same location as was used for Raintree County (1957) and In the Heat of the Night (1967).', u'The scenes of the fuselage in the water were shot in the Ohio River, Illinois, while all the interiors of the plane were shot on stage in Chicago, with the fuselage rigged to a complex gimbal system so as to simulate the jolting motion of the crash. For the scenes where the plane is upside-down and sinking into the water, the scene was shot in the real upside-down fuselage, which could be submerged in a tank.', u""Most of the exterior scenes in New York City were shot in the business district of Chicago, as the production couldn't get permission to shut down the streets in New York City."", u'Just one year prior to acting in this film, Wesley Snipes and Robert Downey, Jr. portrayed best friends in One Night Stand (1997).', u'The film has a similar plot to The Fugitive (1993). Both have innocent fugitives, crashed transportation vehicles, scheming perpetrators, and the fugitives are exonerated at the end among many other parallels. Furthermore, both films feature Tommy Lee Jones as Samuel Gerard. His team is also made up of the same characters from The Fugitive (1993), with the same cast members reprising their roles.', u'Tommy Lee Jones actually jumped in front of a car during shooting. They got the shot in one take, no stuntman.', u'Tommy Lee Jones, Robert Downey, Jr., Joe Pantoliano, and Wesley Snipes all would later appear in Marvel films: Captain America: The First Avenger (2011), the Iron Man, Avengers, and Captain America movies, Daredevil (2003), and the Blade trilogy respectively.', u'Joe Pantoliano said of the location filming, ""When the studio sends you a basket of mosquito repellent, you know you\'re in for a tough one.""', u'According to Stuart Baird, Wesley Snipes ""wasn\'t entirely in love with"" the disguise he wore in the movie.', u""Towards the end of the movie, Gerard and Royce follow Sheridan to the Bayonne docks in New Jersey. Afterwards, they are in a unnamed hospital. However, the police officer outside Sheridan's room is wearing an actual Bayonne Police Department patch on his shoulder."", u'Upon arriving in New York City for the first time, Cosmo Renfro declares how much he hates it already. Joe Pantoliano, in real-life, is a native of the New York City area.', u'The filmmakers worked hard on the plane crash scene, because they knew it would have to top the crash in The Fugitive (1993).', u""In the original cut, Sheridan was working with Barrows, selling intelligence to Chen. Lamb had gotten wind of this, and sent the two agents, that Sheridan killed, to intercept the bag drop between Chen and Sheridan. Barrows then planted Sheridan's fingerprints, to give Lamb his suspect, and Chen arranged Sheridan's assignation on the prisoner transit plane, so Sheridan wouldn't talk. Royce was never part of the conspiracy, and blinded by revenge on Sheridan for killing his two friends, he never killed Newman when Newman saw Royce trying to shoot Sheridan in cold blood. Additional scenes were shot in post-production, after test screenings showed that the audience wanted Gerard chasing down another innocent fugitive, like he did in the first film."", u'Tommy Lee Jones and Michael Paul Chan also appeared in Batman Forever (1995).', u'Possibly an in-joke from the filmmakers, one of the pilots of the plane strongly resembles Harrison Ford, who coincidentally starred in The Fugitive (1993), of which this movie is a sequel.', u'Joe Pantoliano and Michael Paul Chan previously appeared in The Goonies (1985).', u'Wesley Snipes starred in Blade II (2002), the same year Stuart Baird directed Star Trek: Nemesis (2002).

He said, ""Run as hard as you can, and we\'ll keep up.""', u'Johnny Lee Davenport (Henry) first worked alongside Tommy Lee Jones in The Package (1989).', u'Stuart Baird wanted Marie to be likeable, so the audience would sympathize with Mark.', u""Roy Willy's BBQ doesn't exist. It's actually the Bay City General store. It's been around since 1915."", u'The filmmakers studied plane crash videos and photos to see how a plane would break apart.', u'Robert Downey, Jr. worked with real government agents to prepare for his role as Royce.', u'Dick Beebe wrote an uncredited draft of the script.', u'Even though Wesley Snipes is a fifth degree black belt, Stuart Baird wanted him to brawl. Baird wanted the fight scenes to look less choreographed and ""more like grappling.""', u'Stuart Baird used real pilots, instead of actors, to give a more authentic feel.', u""Interior shots of the sinking plane were filmed in a warehouse on Chicago's Southwest Side. The entire plane cabin sat on a rocking platform that could be lifted or rotated using joysticks."", u'To film shots of the plane in water, filmmakers anchored the forty thousand-pound plane in the Ohio River. The plane could be flooded with water on cue.', u'To shoot the escape scene, the plane was submerged in a tank that holds four hundred thousand gallons of water.', u""The Marshal's offices were filmed in the same building and floor used in The Fugitive (1993)."", u'To film shots of the plane landing, a one thousand pound model airplane was built by a seventy-five-man special effects crew, along with a twelve hundred foot runway.', u'Tommy Lee Jones and Robert Downey, Jr. appeared in Natural Born Killers (1994).', u'The Boeing 727 seen in the film, was leased by producers from a Las Vegas casino owner, for the movie.', u'Tom Wood and Tommy Lee Jones appeared in Kaappaus merell\xe4 (1992).', u'Wesley Snipes previously starred in The Fan (1996), which featured John Leguizamo as his agent. Stuart Baird directed Leguizamo in Executive Decision (1996) the same year.', u'The scene, in which Newman is killed, was edited two ways: one way which showed Royce shooting him, the other, which kept it ambiguous as to whether it was Royce, or Sheridan, who shot him.

Tarantino claimed to hate the final version of the film, up until meeting Johnny Cash in an elevator once. Cash told Tarantino that both he and his wife June were fans of his and that they especially liked Natural Born Killers.', u'18 different film formats are seen in the finished film.', u""According to Oliver Stone, Rodney Dangerfield didn't understand the film during shooting, and didn't understand what Stone was trying to do by shooting such a dark subject, as a father molesting his daughter, in the style of a 1950s sitcom. As such, he found it very difficult to perform his part. However, Stone was delighted that when the film came out, Dangerfield's performance was hailed as one of the movie's strongest points."", u'Oliver Stone calls the frequent cuts to black and white, where dialogue is often repeated with a slightly different intonation, ""vertical cutting"". Stone explains that the idea behind the technique is to create an outer moment (the color footage) and an inner moment (the black and white footage) at the same time. For example, he explains this in relation to the waitress in the opening scene (O-Lan Jones), who while taking Mickey\'s order in the \'outer\' scene, is actually flirting with him (or thinking about flirting with him) in the \'inner\' scene. Also in the opening scene, when the cowboy (James Gammon) refers to Mallory as ""pussy"", there is a flash cut to Mickey covered in blood; this is Mickey\'s \'inner\' moment.', u'During filming, Oliver Stone would play African tribal music at full blast on the set, as a way of keeping a frantic mood.', u'The camera never angles on a straight, horizontal level throughout the whole film.', u""The color green is used to indicate the sickness in Mickey's mind and shows up prominently several times during the film: the key lime pie at the diner, the green neon at the drugstore, the green room in the prison."", u'The prison riot was filmed at Stateville Correctional Center in Joliet, Illinois. Eighty percent of the prisoners there, are there for violent crimes. For the first two of four weeks on location, the extras were actual inmates with rubber weapons. For the other two weeks, over 200 extras had to be brought in, because the Stateville inmates had been placed on lockdown.', u'Over 150 rattlesnakes, both real and fake, were used for the scene when Mickey and Mallory tread through the snake field. Initially there were concerns that the actors would being working too close to so many venomous snakes. But since the scene was filmed at night (when temperatures in the desert are significantly cooler), and since snakes (like all cold-blooded animals) are very sluggish in colder temperatures, most of the rattlesnakes slept through the filming of the scene.', u'In an infamous incident after the film had been released, Oliver Stone and Time Warner were sued by Patsy Byers, with the support of author and film producer John Grisham. In March 1995, 18-year-old Sarah Edmondson and her boyfriend Benjamin Darras (also 18) allegedly dropped acid and watched \'Natural Born Killers\'. Later that night, Sarah shot and paralyzed Byers, a store clerk in Ponchatoula, and Benjamin killed cotton gin manager William Savage in Hernando, Mississippi. John Grisham was a personal friend of Savage\'s, and after the murder, Grisham publicly accused Oliver Stone of being irresponsible in making the film, arguing that filmmakers should be held accountable for their work when it incites violent behavior. Byers decided to take legal action against Stone and the studio, and supported by Grisham, she used a ""product liability"" claim in the lawsuit, which argued that Stone had incited the teenagers to commit the crime. Initially, the case was dismissed in January 1997, on the grounds that filmmakers and production companies are protected by the First Amendment. However, in May 1998, the Intermediate Louisiana Court of Appeals overturned the lower court\'s decision, and the case went ahead. The attorneys for Byers\' attempted to prove that Stone and Warner were culpable in the murder and in Byers\' injury because they had purposefully meant to incite violence by ""distributing a film they knew, or should have known would cause and inspire people to commit crimes"". All of Hollywood eagerly awaited the outcome of the trial, because if Stone was found guilty, it would mean a drastic reexamination of the industry practices and would carry all kinds of far reaching implications as regards the content of movies. However, in a landmark decision, Byers\' action was thrown out of court in March 2001, and its dismissal was rubber-stamped by the Louisiana Court of Appeal in June 2002.', u'Took only 56 days to shoot.', u'When producers Jane Hamsher and Don Murphy first brought Quentin Tarantino\'s screenplay to Oliver Stone\'s attention, Stone\'s initial idea was to make a lighthearted all-action blockbuster. His previous film, Taivas ja maa (1993), had been a difficult shoot which had failed at the box office, and he saw \'Natural Born Killers\' as a way to make a fun movie and play with genre conventions. As he puts it himself in Chaos Rising: The Storm Around \'Natural Born Killers\' (2001), he planned to make ""something Arnold Schwarzenegger would be proud of."" As the project developed however, Stone found the movie getting deeper and deeper, and soon all hopes for a simple action spectacular were gone.', u""The film features Rodney Dangerfield's only dramatic performance."", u'Robert Downey, Jr. spent time with Australian television shock-king Steve Dunleavy to prepare for the role of Wayne Gale, and when he came back with an Australian accent, the filmmakers decided to go with it, and Gale became an Australian.', u'Oliver Stone has always maintained that the film is a satire on how serial killers are adored by the media for their horrific actions, and that those who claim the violence in the movie itself is a cause of societal violence have missed the point of the movie entirely.', u""When putting together the music for the film, Oliver Stone and soundtrack producer Trent Reznor both wanted to get Snoop Dogg involved, but Warner wouldn't allow it, as Dogg was on trial for murder at the time."", u""According to Oliver Stone, the use of television commercials was an attempt to illustrate the comforting power such commercials have. Every commercial comes after a horrific moment or a flash cut of a demon, and Stone's idea was that commercials work to soothe people after they have been exposed to something extreme."", u""In the mess hall in the prison, a bald white man is staring at a black man, prompting the black man to try to attack him, before being intercepted by Warden McClusky (Tommy Lee Jones). The bald man was a real prisoner, who had been convicted of murdering his wife and children by beating them to death with a lead pipe. Oliver Stone gave him a featured role, because he said the man's stoicism terrified him."", u'Michael Madsen was initially considered for the role of Mickey, but Warner Bros. wanted somebody less intimidating, and with a softer persona, as they felt this might alleviate the brutality of the character somewhat.', u'The story told on ""American Maniacs"" about Mickey killing a cop after asking him for directions is taken almost verbatim from a story made up by J. Edgar Hoover in the 1930s about bank robbers Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker to try to quash the public\'s growing favorable opinion of the pair. According to Hoover, Barrow approached an Oklahoma City officer, asked for directions and then blew his head off with a shotgun. The story fell apart, though, when questions were raised as to how, if the officer was alone when he was killed, Hoover could possibly have determined that it was Barrow who killed him, as there were no witnesses to the ""murder.""', u'Director of Photography Robert Richardson hated the script, and didn\'t want anything to do with the film, but Oliver Stone used their close friendship to persuade him to accept the job. For numerous reasons, Richardson called shooting the film a ""nightmare"" and one of the worst experiences of his life. The story brought up bad memories from his childhood, leading to insomnia, and a dependence on sleeping pills, throughout the entire shoot. During location scouting, his wife Monona Wali nearly died from an illness (and they later came close to divorcing because of the film). While filming a difficult scene, he broke his finger, and the replacement cameraman cut his eye. Near the end of shooting, his brother went into a coma. However, Richardson has said that all of these problems actually provided him with the creative energy he needed to shoot the film.', u'Oliver Stone wanted Juliette Lewis to bulk up for the role of Mallory so that she looked tougher, but Lewis refused, saying she wanted the character to look like a pushover, not like a female bodybuilder. In the end, Stone agreed, but he insisted she take kick-boxing lessons so that she looked credible when fighting.', u""After Quentin Tarantino had written the script, he promised his friend Rand Vossler, a fellow clerk at Video Archives, the director's chair. The pair couldn't find funding, and eventually decided to shoot it guerrilla-style (without permits) on the streets of Los Angeles, on black and white 16mm film stock. Shortly before production, Oliver Stone found the script and wanted to buy it. In exchange for giving up his directorial debut, Rand is credited as a co-producer."", u'Entertainment Weekly ranked the film as the 8th most controversial movie ever made.', u""Woody Harrelson, in an interview, spoke about the rape scene between Mickey and the hostage he takes. He expressed his hope that Oliver Stone had not added any additional footage of the controversial part into the Director's Cut. He was promptly told on camera that Stone had indeed done so."", u""Oliver Stone says that his biggest regret about the film is the fact that he had to cut out most of Pruitt Taylor Vince's performance as the prison guard Kavanaugh. As filmed, Kavanaugh becomes a comic character, who Mickey uses as a shield while moving through the prison, and who ends up being shot sixteen times by the time Mickey meets Warden McClusky (Tommy Lee Jones) at the stairs. In the finished version of the film, you don't actually see Kavanaugh being shot at all, prior to the stairs. Stone says he was forced to cut much of this, because the studio insisted that the movie be under two hours. Strangely however, the footage of Kavanaugh was not restored by Stone for his Director's Cut, nor was it included as a deleted scene on the DVD."", u'Steve Buscemi and Tim Roth were both offered the role of Wayne Gale, and turned it down. Jane Hamsher claims in her book about the movie, that they did so because Quentin Tarantino told them he would never cast either of them in any of his movies again, if they took the role.', u'This film contains almost 3,000 cuts. Most films have 600-700. Negative cutter Donah Bassett cut 4,000 negative images into the film, the most complex job ever undertaken by a negative cutter.', u'The editing of the film took eleven months.', u""Tommy Lee Jones has said that his over-the-top performance was partly inspired by Moli\xe8re's play 'Le Bourgeois gentilhomme'; a satirical look at social climbing and the bizarre things people will do to achieve fame."", u'The idea for the image of the headless man came to Oliver Stone in a dream.', u'Senator Bob Dole publicly denounced the film for its promotion of violence, even though, as he was later forced to admit, he had never actually seen the film.', u""This was Quentin Tarantino's second feature length screenplay (his first was True Romance (1993)). The script was rewritten by Oliver Stone, producer Richard Rutowski and screenwriter David Veloz prior to, and during production. The finished film bears little resemblance to Tarantino's original script."", u""The interview between Wayne Gale and Mickey was based upon Geraldo Rivera's interviews with Charles Manson and the infamous Mike Wallace interview with Manuel Noriega."", u""According to a newspaper article seen briefly at approximately 27 minutes in, Mickey and Mallory's murder spree began on May 7, 1993."", u'During the scene where Micky and Mallory take a hostage to a motel room, the films Midnight Express (1978) and Scarface (1983) are showing on television. Oliver Stone wrote the screenplays to both films.', u""Mickey Knox is named after actor Mickey Knox, who wrote the English dialogue for The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966) and Once Upon a Time in the West (1968), Quentin Tarantino's favorite westerns."", u'For the numerous scenes involving rear projection, the projected footage was shot prior to principal photography, then edited together, and projected live onto the stage, behind the live actors. For example, when Mallory drives past a building and flames are projected onto the wall, this was shot live using footage projected onto the fa\xe7ade of a real building.', u'Oliver Stone met with singer Tori Amos and openly offered her the part of Mallory. Early in her career Amos had been pursing acting as well as singing. She was interested, until he explained he also wanted to have her song ""Me and a Gun"" play during each scene where Mallory kills someone. The song is an a capella account of Amos\' real life rape. In response, Amos slapped him across the face and stormed out. Amos details this story in her autobiography ""All These Years"". She also references the incident in her hit song ""A Sorta Fairytale"", with the lyrics: ""Feel better with Oliver Stone until I almost smacked him; it seemed right that night.""', u'When Jack Scagnetti (Tom Sizemore) goes into Mallory\'s cell, and throughout this scene, you can read two different paragraphs above the door in the cell, and below Mallory, on the bedside. The one near the door reads: ""Come let\'s away / to prison we two / alone will sing / like birds in a cage."" This is from \'King Lear\', a play written by William Shakespeare, as Lear and his daughter Cordelia are being taken away to prison. The other paragraph reads: ""He is coming! He is coming! / Like a bridegroom from his room / Came the hero from his prison / To the scaffold and the doom."" These lines are from the poem ""The Execution Of Montrose"" by William Edmondstoune Aytoun.', u'Tom Sizemore plays Detective Jack Scagnetti in this film. The name ""Scagnetti"" was also mentioned as the name of Mr. Blonde\'s parole officer in Reservoir Dogs (1992), also written by Quentin Tarantino.', u'Robert Downey, Jr. and Tom Sizemore both later served time in prison, for drug-related offenses.', u'The title card for the film is an homage to Roger Corman.', u'The drug store scene was filmed in an Albuquerque building, that was a real drug store, that had closed just prior to filming. The original fixtures and pharmacy area were still in the store, making set up very easy. The sign above the door was added for the movie, and was still there several months after filming ended. The building is now a Hobby Lobby. 1,000 green fluorescent bulbs were used to light the scene.', u'Owen (Arliss Howard), the inmate that helps Mickey and Mallory out of the prison, is shown in the first scene. He is at a table reading a newspaper that reads ""666 death"". He is only shown for a second.

The Irish Film Centre, which is a membership club, and not subject to the same rules as public theaters, booked the film and had it scheduled to screen for a month long run in early 1995. The film censorship board threatened legal action if the film was shown, and it was withdrawn.', u'The bridge where Mickey and Mallory get married, is the Rio Grande Gorge Bridge over the Rio Grande Gorge, outside of Taos, New Mexico.', u'Acclaimed as the #1 film of the 1990s by Entertainment Weekly.', u""In the UK, the film's video release was to be the same week that Thomas Hamilton walked into a primary school, in the Scottish town of Dunblane, and killed sixteen children and a teacher, before killing himself. Warner Brothers immediately went to the British Board of Film Classification to take another look at the certification granted the film. The BBFC however stood by their decision, so Warner Brothers took it upon themselves to withhold video release. Thus, when the film had its television premiere on the UK's channel 5 two years later, it became one of the few films to be broadcast on television, without having a video release beforehand."", u'Premiere voted this movie as one of ""The 25 Most Dangerous Movies"".', u'Gary Oldman and James Woods were considered for the role of Jack Scagnetti.', u'Rodney Dangerfield wrote all the ""filthy stuff"" his character said. Oliver Stone didn\'t give the comedian a script; he simply told Dangerfield he was going to play ""the father from hell.""', u'Woody Harrelson said he was cast because Oliver Stone told him he had the look of violence in his eyes.', u""Deputy Sheriff Duncan Homolka's (Joe Grifasi) name is a reference to Karla Homolka who, with her husband Paul Bernardo, murdered two teenage girls and her own sister."", u""The unique look of the film was based upon Arthur Penn's Bonnie and Clyde (1967), one of Oliver Stone's favorite movies. In particular, Stone was influenced by the famous death scene, which used innovative editing techniques provided by multiple cameras shooting from different angles at different speeds. Stone had used similar, although considerably more restrained, techniques in his previous two films, JFK - avoin tapaus (1991) and Taivas ja maa (1993), and would continue to employ these techniques for his next two films, Nixon (1995) and U-k\xe4\xe4nn\xf6s helvettiin (1997)."", u""The film was originally going to be shot in Panavision, as Oliver Stone's previous four films had been, but he decided that it should be framed in standard 1.85:1. The Panavision E-Series anamorphic lenses that had been reserved for the film were used to shoot The Pelican Brief (1993) instead."", u'John Cusack turned down the role of Wayne Gale.', u""Three years prior, Robert De Niro and Juliette Lewis had worked together on Cape Fear (1991). When De Niro praised her work in the film, Lewis explained that she improvised most of her lines, which De Niro did not like. He admonished the young actress for disrespecting the film's writers."", u""According to Tom Sizemore, he got the part of Detective Jack Scagnetti after writing a monologue for the character, which he made Oliver Stone listen to in the parking lot of a bar. In addition to reading up on Ted Bundy and John Wayne Gacy, he got clean for 97 days before filming. Unfortunately, the sobriety didn't last."", u'Rodney Dangerfield and Robert Downey, Jr. also co-starred in the college-party comedy Back to School (1986).', u'Mickey calls Mallory ""Mal"". In Spanish, ""Mal"" is the common word for ""evil"".', u'Chris Penn turned down the role of Jack Scagnetti in favor of True Romance (1993), which was also written by Quentin Tarantino.', u'Oliver Stone considered this to be his road film, specifically naming Bonnie and Clyde (1967) as a source of inspiration.', u'Rosanna Arquette pursued the role of Mallory.', u'The film cast includes three Oscar winners: Tommy Lee Jones, Steven Wright, and Adrien Brody; and three Oscar nominees: Woody Harrelson, Juliette Lewis, and Robert Downey, Jr.', u""Whilst shooting the POV scene, wherein Mallory runs into the wire mesh, Robert Richardson broke his finger, and the replacement cameraman cut his eye.

The story behind this change in directors was chronicled in the book ""Killer Instinct"" written by producer Jane Hamsher.', u'Joe Grifasi who plays Deputy Sheriff Duncan Homolka would later costar with Tommy Lee Jones again in Batman Forever (1995), with Jones as Two-Face and Grifasi as a hostage.', u'The wrestling match that Rodney Dangerfield is watching involves Chris Chavis as Tatanka (the Native American wrestler) and Barry Hardy.', u'The song ""Back in Baby\'s Arms"" plays on the soundtrack at one point. That song also played in Planes, Trains & Automobiles (1987), which also featured Edie McClurg in a brief role.

Tommy Lee Jones is from Texas.', u""The red glasses Mickey wears during the opening scene of the movie are reminiscent of chicken glasses, tiny red glasses once sold to farmers to keep their chickens from murdering one another. The red glass kept the chickens from seeing the color red, or more specifically, blood. For some strange reason, when chickens see red, they peck at it. If they see red on a chicken in the flock, they gang together and peck at the bloody spot until the offending chicken is dead ... conversely, in that opening scene, once Mickey and Mallory saw red, they didn't stop until almost everyone was dead. Industrialization now keeps chickens pinned up, and incapable of getting at one another, so chicken glasses are no longer used."", u'Kathy Long: is the female police officer who beats up Mickey at the pharmacy.', u'Don Murphy: one of the jovial guards who gets shot and killed by Mickey, when he begins his escape from prison, after the interview with Wayne Gale.', u'Jane Hamsher: as a demon-like character during a hallucination sequence.', u'Richard Rutowski: a demon during the prison riot', u'Hank Corwin: is the headless man in the living room.', u""During Mickey's escape from prison during the tornado, there is a shot where a convict falls under a galloping horse. This was completely genuine, as the stuntman really did lose his footing and fall under the horse. Fortunately, he was uninjured."", u""Oliver Stone's least favorite scene in the film is when Mickey overpowers the prison guards after the interview with Wayne Gale is terminated. Stone feels that the device of having Mickey distract the guards by telling a joke is too unrealistic."", u'When Scagnetti is speaking with the warden, he says something about being as big as Jack Ruby. Later, Scagnetti is shot to death on live television, like Lee Harvey Oswald.', u'Every time Mallory engages in sexual or sexually suggestive activities with someone (other than Mickey), she attacks them (e.g. the trucker in the bar, Scagnetti, the gas station attendant).', u""The Director's Cut of the film, actually shows the death of Warden McClusky.

Lobell noted, ""When I read the script, I thought that if Cybill was going to return to features, this should be it, because the film is a romantic comedy, and I always thought of Cybill as very funny in a Carole Lombard way."" Ardolino noted that Shepherd shared qualities with her character that made her the ideal candidate for Corinne Jeffries. Ardolino said, ""Corinne is beautiful and determined, yet she\'s vulnerable, with a sense of humor, not unlike Cybill\'s own. Corinne is loyal and passionate and obsessed with love, because she cares so deeply about someone.""', u'The movie appealed to Cybill Shepherd for two reasons, which were her character Corinne Jeffries, and Emile Ardolino. Shepherd said, ""When I found out Emile Ardolino was going to direct it, I knew it was going to be a tasteful project, because of Dirty Dancing (1987), his outstanding work on PBS, and his Academy Award-winning documentary He Makes Me Feel Like Dancin\' (1983)."" Corinne Jeffries interested Shepherd because she was a departure from her real persona, and from her television alter-ego of Maddie Hayes on Moonlighting (1985). Shepherd noted: ""Many moons ago, Stella Adler told me I should play what I haven\'t lived. It would help me with life, and so I\'ve used this as a general guide for parts. Corinne was a good part for me, because it offered a lot of challenges. To play a character at twenty-one, and again in her early 40s. Someone who experiences the devastation of losing her husband, and a mom with a grown up daughter. All those things, except being twenty-one, which I have no interest in being again, were new to me.""', u'Perry Howze and Randy Howze brought their script to Producer Mike Lobell, who immediately responded. Lobell said: ""I loved the story, and the people at TriStar felt the same way. The story moved everyone because it\'s about people, love, memory, and it\'s also very funny.""', u""Determined to present as realistic a setting as possible, Perry Howze and Randy Howze decided to employ Corinne Jeffries (Cybill Shepherd) as the curator of the Smithsonian Institute's U.S. President First Ladies' Gowns Exhibit, a show that had dazzled them when they had visited it as children. Corinne Jeffries' predicament, as invented by the Howzes, is to raise funds to enlarge the First Ladies display, through a gala event. They queried the Smithsonian, asking if this character and her plight sounded plausible. It was more than plausible. The Smithsonian, in fact, was trying to raise two million dollars for the display. Their first Ladies' Gowns Exhibit, once an extravagant show, had been reduced to one alcove, with the rest of the exhibit in storage."", u""The movie's rendition of the Smithsonian Institute's First Ladies' Gowns Exhibit, created by Production Designer J. Dennis Washington and Costume Designer Albert Wolsky, was replete with U.S. President First Lady mannequins of Jacqueline Kennedy, Rosalynn Carter, Eleanor Roosevelt, Lady Bird Johnson, Betty Ford, Mamie Eisenhower, and Nancy Reagan, all wearing copies of their original gowns."", u'The song ""After All"" was Academy Award and Golden Globe nominated for Best Original Song for Tom Snow (music) and Dean Pitchford (lyrics), but failed to win at either Awards ceremony.', u'A soundtrack album has never been released for this movie.', u'The film\'s theme song, ""After All"", performed by Cher and Peter Cetera, was a Billboard Top 10 single hit, and went to the number six spot on the American Billboard Hot 100 in May 1989.', u'Once Cybill Shepherd was secured, the filmmakers then faced the formidable task of casting a young actor to star opposite her, as her ""recycled"" husband. The part required an accomplished performer who could portray a multi-dimensional role, an appealing leading man who could balance romance with comedy, as well as convincingly playing two characters in one. Robert Downey, Jr., named the ""Hottest Actor of the Year"" by Rolling Stone Magazine, was their man. A veteran film actor, Downey\'s memorable performances in a variety of roles, both supporting and starring, had earned him critical respect and audience popularity. Emile Ardolino said, ""Robert is an extraordinary talent, who is skillful, passionate, innately funny, sexy, and always surprising. He brings a tremendous amount of vitality and complexity to all of his performances.', u'The filmmakers immediately thought of Mary Stuart Masterson to play Corinne Jeffries\' (Cybill Shepherd\'s) daughter Miranda, the independent Yale law student powerfully attracted to her Yale classmate-turned-house-guest, Alex Finch (Robert Downey, Jr.). When approached for the role, Masterson was initially noncommittal. Mike Lobell\'s tenacity, however, was persuasive. Masterton recalled: ""I went to Sundance, Utah, to think things over and ski, when Mike Lobell came skiing down the slopes after me with pen and contract in hand, saying, \'you must do this movie, it will be the best thing you\'ve ever done\'. He was obviously very convincing.""', u'Mary Stuart Masterson noted of her character Miranda, that it added a new dimension to her repertoire: ""Miranda is more intellectual than any other character I\'ve played, You know, I usually play street smart urchins, pregnant, and barefoot."" Nonetheless, the press kit states Masterson personally related to Miranda: ""I went to schools very much like Yale. They were pressure cookers."" she said of her years at the prestigious Dalton School in New York City, and later at New York University, where she studied anthropology and film.""', u'Attention to detail for the look and feel of the film extended to Cybill Shepherd. The filmmakers and Shepherd wanted her character of Corinne Jeffries to appear as different as possible from her Moonlighting (1985) Maddie Hayes character. To achieve this, they cut her hair at least five inches in a more conservative style. Costume Designer Albert Wolsky draped Shepherd in a lot of black and/or structured clothing at the beginning of the film, also noting that ""We never see her wearing black on Moonlighting (1985)."" In the second half of the film, as Corinne Jeffries (Cybill Shepherd) starts to mentally and physically open up, Wolsky dressed her in softer, more voluminous creations. Wolsky explained: ""Her colors get softer, the fabrics go from wools to chiffons and cottons."" Director of Photography William A. Fraker highlighted Shepherd with his own special brand of luminous lighting. The veteran Cinematographer was well suited for the movie, not only was his work highly respected within the film industry, but, having shot Shepherd in her Loreal commercials, Fraker was very familiar with the actress.', u'Real-life Washington Post journalist Benjamin C. Bradlee wasn\'t the only genuine Washington, D.C. article to appear in the movie. Ben Bradlee, in the film, is a real-life character based on Benjamin C. Bradlee, and is played in the movie by Henderson Forsythe. Perry Howze said: ""We sent him (Bradlee) the script, and he and his wife Sally Quinn read it, and loved it. His only stipulation was to clean up his language. We had a few \'hells\' and some choice expletives coming out of his mouth, and he said, \'for God\'s sake, get those four letter words out. I don\'t talk like that\'."" The real-life Bradlee later appeared in the documentary Fuck (2005).', u'The film was described by Emile Ardolino as ""A romantic comedy about love, and the transforming effect it has on our characters\' lives. It\'s about people who learn to live mortally in the present by letting go of the past. Imagine this happened to you: you\'re a normal person, and all of a sudden you get your memory back from your past life, and you realize that your girlfriend is your daughter, and her mother is your wife from your previous life. I was intrigued by the comic possibilities of this predicament. We\'ve all probably gone to a place we\'ve never been, and felt like we\'ve been there before. We\'ve met a person for the first time, and felt as though we\'ve known them our entire lives.""', u'The film opens up in Washington, D.C., in the 1960s. The setting was deliberate. Randy Howze explained: ""Washington was magical then. The Kennedy Presidency was in full force. There was so much promise, and like that, Corinne\'s life starts out so blissfully. She is marrying the man of her dreams, Louie Jeffries. The couple has everything going for them, and ahead of them, like the \'Camelot Years\', and then, boom, it all ends, and we cut to twenty years later, where again the times are reflected in Corinne\'s life. She\'s now a modern working woman, and a single parent.""', u'Show-business trade-paper ""Variety"" said of this movie in its review, ""Here comes Chances Are, and there goes Mr. Jordan"", a reference to the earlier heavenly comedy Here Comes Mr. Jordan (1941), which had been remade as Heaven Can Wait (1978).', u'Snaring two Washington, D.C. prime locations, the Smithsonian Institute and the Washington Post, proved to be challenges indeed. As Mike Lobell explained: ""The Smithsonian took about four months to give us the go ahead. They, for good reason, were very concerned about how they would be portrayed to the public. We had to assure them that we would present the institution in the best possible light. They finally agreed, and treated us wonderfully in Washington."" Securing the Washington Post was due, in part, to Perry Howze and Randy Howze. Lobell said, ""We were fortunate because our screenwriters, who grew up in Washington, D.C., had been childhood friends of Benjamin C. Bradlee\'s daughters, and therefore knew Bradlee."" The production got the full support of the Washington Post, filming in front of the building, inside the press room, in its lobby, and at its printing presses. This was quite a coup it was thought by the filmmakers, considering that the newspaper had refused to cooperate with the filming of All the President\'s Men (1976).', u""The angels' tablets are shaped like the Ten Commandments."", u'Cybill Shepherd brought her then eight-month-old twins to the set every day.', u""The picture was shot in the U.S. on-location in Washington, D.C., and featured some of the city's famous landmarks, including Capitol Hill, the Smithsonian Institute, the Washington Post, the Jefferson Memorial, and the historic city of Georgetown."", u'Robert Downey, Jr. and Mary Stuart Masterson appeared in the documentary The Last Party (1993).', u""The amount of time between husband Louie Jeffries (Christopher McDonald) passing away in 1964, and then returning as another person inside Alex Finch's (Robert Downey, Jr.'s) body in 1987, was twenty-three years."", u'Ryan O\'Neal was cast as Philip Train. Perry Howze and Randy Howze described Philip Train as ""a noble character, the last gentleman roaming the earth, because he has respected Corinne Jeffries (Cybill Shepherd) and her love for her late husband, who was also his best friend, so much, that he has never tried to impose himself on her. He doesn\'t want to jeopardize their friendship. This kind of character doesn\'t exist in 1988, but we want him back in the world."" The film\'s press kit states: ""(Ryan) O\'Neal endowed Philip (Train) with the strength, vulnerability, and comedic sensitivity needed to ennoble this endearing underdog, a character who gives true modern meaning to the word \'gentleman\', as he waits for the woman he quietly loves, to someday take serious notice of him.""', u'Emile Ardolino and William A. Fraker wanted to give the movie a cohesive look, that would convey an old-fashioned romantic comedy, but they also wanted to emphasize certain distinctive aspects of the film. For example, the scenes set in the early 1960s would have a unique ambiance, distinguished from the scenes set in the present, and those set in a heavenly place, which the filmmakers refer to as ""Limbodrome"", had to be unusual and ethereal.', u""There was only a 15 year age difference between Cybill Shepherd and Robert Downey Jr.. Shepherd's character was widowed for 23 years when Downey shows up."", u""At 5-foot 7-inches tall, Robert Downey Jr. had to wear lifts in scenes with Cybill Shepherd and Ryan O'Neal."", u'After viewing Dirty Dancing (1987), Mike Lobell was certain that Emile Ardolino had the proper sentiment, compassion, and intimacy to direct this film. Lobell explained, ""I could see that Dirty Dancing (1987) was directed by a man who had a lot of heart, which was exactly what I wanted for our film.""', u'Debut on-screen performance in a theatrical movie of band leader Lester Lanin.', u""Cybill Shepherd had had a personal relationship with Peter Bogdanovich, who had directed Ryan O'Neal in Paper Moon (1973), What's Up, Doc?

Around two dozen 1960s vintage automobiles were secured from area car club members, many driven by their owners, to dress the street. These included a 1956 Buick Century, a 1957 Ford Fairlane 500, a 1959 Cadillac Seville, a 1959 Chevrolet Biscayne, a 1960 Mercury Comet dressed as City Cab 101, a 1960 Pontiac Star Chief, a 1958-1960 Edsel, a 1962 Studebaker Lark, a 1963 Chevrolet Corvette, and a matched pair of 1964 Volkswagen Beetles.

Well, actually, we kissed like forty times for the one scene. That was because Warren Beatty was helping Toback. Beatty\'s really knowledgeable in a lot of areas, especially fucking.

In the book, numerous cast members recall stories in which Chase insulted the cast and crew. According to Terry Sweeney, Chase made homophobic remarks to Sweeney, who is openly gay. According to Will Ferrell, Chase was the worst host during his time on the show. Chase has continued to make cameo appearances on the show, but has not hosted since 1997.', u'When twenty-five-year-old Kenan Thompson (born in 1978) was hired for the twenty-ninth season (2003-2004), he became the first cast member who was born after the show premiered in 1975.', u'In 1995, Steve Carell auditioned for the show, along with his wife, Nancy Carell.

The sixth season was so disastrous, that NBC President Fred Silverman called in Programming Executive Dick Ebersol (one of the creative masterminds of the original show) to save the show. Ebersol fired Doumanian and the rest of the cast, except Eddie Murphy and Joe Piscopo. He hired a new cast, and the show eventually regained its ratings, mainly due to Murphy's popularity. When Michaels returned in the 1985-1986 season, he wanted his own cast, so the remaining members were fired. This season was low-rated, putting the show on the brink of cancellation.

Partly out of both tradition and superstition, the seats are still in use to this day. Since then, NBC has had to pay out annual fines to the city of New York (a relatively minor business expense, all things considered).

He essentially wears the same make-up, mohawk, mesh tank top, and lots of studded leather.', u'In the scene where Bill Paxton is speaking to Kelly LeBrock while interrogating everyone over what had happened the previous night, in the background, Suzanne Snyder and Anthony Michael Hall are struggling to stay in character, but it is clear they are laughing. John Hughes chose to use this take in the completed film.', u'Shermer High School is also the name of the high school in The Breakfast Club (1985).', u'The goodbye scene between Anthony Michael Hall, Ilan Mitchell-Smith, and Kelly LeBrock moved John Hughes to tears.', u'The film is titled after the anthology comic book series, published in the 1950s by the legendary William M. Gaines and his company EC Comics, which also published Tales from the Crypt and Mad Magazine. The plot of the film is loosely based on the story ""Made of the Future"" by Al Feldstein, from the fifth issue.

He stated that he and his co-star, Robert Rusler (Max) joked about defecating in people\'s trailers throughout the shoot. They eventually did it in one female cast member\'s trailer, but it was not LeBrock\'s. John Hughes questioned everyone in the cast as to who did it, and when he got to Downey, he replied, ""No, but I sure wish it was me who did it."" He also stated there was never any tension between him and John Hughes, and he highly respected his friendship.', u""On the last day of filming, Robert Rusler auditioned for the role of Ron Grady in A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge (1985).

Right before cameras rolled, Anthony Michael Hall farted, breaking the cast members' concentration, and ruining the take. Rusler estimates the scene cost one hundred thousand dollars to shoot. Because the take was blown, it had to be filmed in reverse, with additional tweaks in post-production."", u'Robert Rusler said the first scene he ever filmed as a professional actor, was when his character Max dumps the Slushee on Gary and Wyatt. He also said the celebratory handshake he does with Robert Downey, Jr. right before pouring the Slushee was improvised between the two of them.', u'Kelly LeBrock initially turned down the role of Lisa, as she was vacationing in France at the time, and was ""having too much fun riding horses on the beach"".', u'The piano girl (October 1982 Playboy Centerfold Kym Malin) performed her own stunts. This included the use of a scaffold when hoisted up where the chimney is a makeshift vacuum, where her clothes were ripped off, and a crane when hoisted in the air, where the piano girl lands in the swimming pool half-naked (in real-life, her Playboy centerfold pictorial used a swimming pool in the background).', u'The jacket worn by Kelly Le Brock in the film, was sold to Dina Collection, a pawn shop in Beverly Hills, California, for twenty-five thousand dollars.', u'Depending on the version of the film, at the end of the film when Lisa is twirling her whistle, either the Weird Science track is played or the Rocky theme is played.', u'Vernon Wells (Lord General) said his first time visiting America was when he filmed his part in this movie.

John Hughes was a Y&T fan."", u'In the final cut of the film, Max and Ian are last seen fleeing the party when the bikers invade. A follow-up scene was shot in which multi-colored clouds engulf the teens and they transform into a pig and donkey. They then bend over to see their reflections in hubcaps of a car and tails rip through the seats of their pants. Producer Joel Silver insisted on cutting the scene, rationalizing that it detracted from a later transformation in the film. Photos of the actors in this make-up were published in the March 1986 issue of Cinefantastique.', u'Demi Moore and Robin Wright auditioned for the part of Lisa. Their scene partner for their screentests was Mikul Robins, who appears in the movie as one of The Weenies.', u'Lisa was made from a Barbie doll, and drives a pink convertible, just like Barbie and her fleet of primarily pink convertibles.', u'Wyatt has a poster on the wall of his bedroom with the slogan, ""The Wave of the Future"", from a promotional campaign for a company called VM Software.
