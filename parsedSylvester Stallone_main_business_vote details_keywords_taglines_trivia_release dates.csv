They went through about seven pairs of heat protective gloves due to this. Sly claims after making the knife, he had a rather warm handshake."", u""Sylvester Stallone specifically wanted the film to be set in the midst of the most brutal ongoing global conflict that was basically ignored by the public and media. After ruling out established (and well-known) conflicts in the Middle East, Latin America and Africa, Stallone talked to international experts who told him about the Burmese junta's mass murder of the Karen people. He then set the movie's storyline in the middle of this genocide."", u'Originally, Rambo was supposed to hold the M2 .50-cal. machine gun in his hands and fire it, but when fully assembled the weapon weighed 120 pounds.

However, returning Iraq and Afghanistan veterans who had used the M2 in combat noted that the wounds were quite accurate, and if anything, toned down from reality.

This Christmas.']","[u""During preproduction, as the filmmakers tried to find a good location to shoot the fight, they met with constant obstacles - every suitable arena was booked out. Sylvester Stallone knew that HBO had an upcoming PPV event with Bernard Hopkins taking on Jermaine Taylor in the main event, at the Mandalay Resort and Casino in Las Vegas. Stallone suggested that the film could piggyback the real event, using the real HBO format, the real crowd, even the real press conference setup. As such, the press conference scene was shot only moments after the real press conference with Hopkins and Taylor, whilst the scene when Rocky walks through the curtain and down to the ring was shot using the real Hopkins/Taylor crowd. Stallone was hoping that the crowd wouldn't boo or cause any problems, but as he made his way to the ring (as Rocky), the whole building gave him a standing ovation and began to chant 'ROCKY, ROCKY'. The crowd was never told to stand up or to chant - they had done it completely on their own, and according to the filmmakers, by far the biggest cheer of the night was for Rocky, not for any of the real fighters."", u""The bout between Rocky and Dixon was filmed with actors Sylvester Stallone and Antonio Tarver really hitting one another. According to Stallone, not a single punch in the fight was pulled, and every hit on film was a hit for real. Furthermore, Stallone has revealed that the scene where Rocky is knocked down for a 9 count, and is trying to get to his feet by taking hold of the rope, but is having difficulty focusing on it, is completely genuine; Tarver really did knock him down, and he really couldn't get up."", u'According to Sylvester Stallone, the shot of Rocky standing alone on the museum steps before the second set of end credits was actually filmed without him knowing.', u'According to Stallone, Carl Weathers does not appear in the film because Weathers wanted a role in the film, even though his character Apollo Creed had died in Rocky IV (1985); Stallone refused, so Weathers refused to grant Stallone permission to use archive footage of him. The brief clip of the fight between Rocky and Apollo was recreated using a body double.', u""The film was partially inspired by the George Foreman-Michael Moorer fight in 1994. Foreman had formerly retired from boxing in 1977, but in 1987, the 38 year old had decided to make a comeback. This comeback culminated in 1994 when the, by then, 45 year old Foreman, challenged the 26 year old world heavyweight champion Michael Moorer. The fight took place on November 5 in Las Vegas. For nine rounds, Moorer toyed with Foreman, easily out-boxing him. Entering the tenth round, Foreman was trailing on all scorecards. However, in the tenth round, completely out of nowhere, Foreman landed a vicious shot to Moorer's chin, knocking the younger man out and scoring a TKO victory, becoming the oldest world heavyweight champion in history."", u'Until Creed (2015), Sylvester Stallone insisted that this would be the last Rocky film.', u'The film contains flashbacks from every Rocky film except Rocky V (1990).', u'Pedro Lovell reprises his role as Spider Rico, the boxer defeated by Rocky in the opening scene of Rocky (1976).', u'Sylvester Stallone said that he decided to make this movie, because he was so unhappy with the ending of Rocky V (1990). He actually wanted to make this film back in 1999, but it would not get green-lit until six years later.', u'All of the Rocky training scenes in the gym were shot in one 17-hour shoot.', u""The film was shot in 38 days. The very first thing to be shot was the fight between Dixon and Rocky. This was done because Sylvester Stallone's training (which had been going on for six months) had to stop once the film went into production and he began to concentrate on directing. If the fight had been left until the end of the schedule, Stallone would not have been in as good shape as he was at the start."", u'According to Sylvester Stallone in his DVD Commentary, he did consider having his real-life son Sage Stallone reprise the role of Robert ""Rocky"" Jr. which he had played in Rocky V (1990), but he decided against it because he feared people would read too much into the personal conflict between Rocky and Robert regarding Robert\'s belief that he is ""living in his father\'s shadow"".', u'In the scene in the meat factory between Paulie and Rocky, Paulie asks if Rocky is angry because they took down his statue, a possible reference to the real life controversy which surrounded the statue. During the making of Rocky III (1982), a 9ft tall, 1500-pound bronze statue designed by A. Thomas Schomberg was placed at the top of the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Arts. After filming wrapped, Sylvester Stallone tried to donate the statue to the museum but they said they didn\'t want it, sparking a huge debate between the Museum and the City\'s Art Commission about what constituted \'art\'. The museum claimed the statue was nothing more than a ""movie prop"", and didn\'t want it. Local people were outraged, and the statue was ultimately placed in front of the Wachovia Spectrum in South Philadelphia. It was later returned to the Art Museum for the filming of Rocky V (1990), after which it was again moved to the front of the Spectrum.', u'In his DVD commentary, Sylvester Stallone explains that some of Rocky\'s dialogue with Marie (Geraldine Hughes) was improvised on-set. For example, for the scene where he installs the light bulb, Stallone had no idea the bulb would be so bright, and his reaction to the glare is completely genuine. The line to Marie about meetings Steps\' father on a cruise ship was another improvised line, as was his observation that he\'s a better dancer then the average bear. Stallone was so surprised with himself for coming up with this comparison, that his next line, ""Where that came from, I don\'t know"", was also improvised.', u'The computer simulation fight was based on The Super Fight (1970) which pitted Muhammad Ali against Rocky Marciano. Every possible scenario was considered and filmed and the computer decided that Marciano would win in the 13th round. When told of the result, Ali retorted ""that computer was made in Alabama"".', u""Sylvester Stallone explains in Skill vs. Will: The Making of 'Rocky Balboa' (2007) that Milo Ventimiglia landed the role of Robert, Jr. in part because of the similarities between their mouths; if you look closely, you can see that Ventimiglia's mouth hooks down in much the same way as Stallone's does."", u'In earlier drafts of the screenplay, Rocky\'s former opponents Clubber Lang and Ivan Drago had cameo appearances. Clubber would have been a ringside commentator for the bout with Dixon and made disparaging remarks about Rocky. The scene with Drago had Rocky visiting him in a hospital where he is dying of AIDS from steroid abuse. Supposedly Rocky would have told a nurse, ""If he dies, he dies"" - the same line Drago said about Apollo Creed in the fourth movie. Both of these scenes were eventually removed from the script.', u""In the DVD commentary for his film First Blood (1982) Sylvester Stallone recalls an incident during filming where a girl in the town bar pretended to be a fan of his in order to try and wheedle a free round of drinks out of him. He later includes just such a scene in 'Rocky Balboa'."", u'According to Sylvester Stallone, Antonio Tarver held up filming of the fight scene and demanded a higher salary. He refused to start filming until he was guaranteed more money. Stallone gave up a large part of his own salary and paid it to Tarver.', u'The paintings made by Paulie in the film were done by Burt Young, an avid painter.', u'Adrian Balboa has a real grave in Philly.', u'According to an interview with Mark S. Driscoll of Look! Effects, one of the fight scenes uses backgrounds from an earlier fight which Sylvester Stallone actually attended prior to filming. He said it should be possible to see Stallone (as himself) in the audience while Stallone (as Rocky) is in the ring.', u""As he had done with the previous five films, writer Sylvester Stallone incorporated a great deal of biographical material into this film. As Stallone himself explains on the DVD commentary, to a certain extent, Mason Dixon is based on himself; a man who has made some bad decisions after taking advice from people who didn't really have his best interests at heart."", u'After the release of the film, critics hailed the fighting scenes as the most realistic in the entire Rocky saga. On the DVD, Sylvester Stallone hypothesizes that a major factor in this realism was that he used realistic sound-effects for punches. When a punch lands in the film, the sound used was a real punch, whereas in previous films, sounds used for punches had included shotgun blasts, broken bottles, chains and baseball bats hitting wet leather.', u'On the DVD commentary, Sylvester Stallone says he based the idea of Rocky owning a restaurant and spending his time telling old fight stories on former world heavyweight champion Jack Dempsey.', u""According to Sylvester Stallone, they put both endings (one with Dixon winning by decision, and one with Rocky winning by decision) on the DVD so that fans could choose how they want the character's saga to end."", u""Adrian Balboa was alive in the first few drafts of the script, while Robert Balboa was in the U.S. Air Force, then titled Rocky VI: Puncher's Chance. At this point, the story revolved around Rocky running a local gym for youths. However, Sylvester Stallone felt that the film lacked the necessary emotional impact it needed. So, he and Talia Shire came to an agreement that her character would be best left out of the film, as this would create an emotional chasm for Rocky from the very first moment of the film. To ensure that fans did not think she had been written out of the film because of a dispute with Stallone or because she refused to be in it, Shire made a public statement supporting Stallone's decision to kill off the character."", u'""Take You Back"", the song which opens the film, was first performed by Frank Stallone on a street corner in the original Rocky.', u'Andy (Don Sherman), the bartender from Rocky (1976), Rocky III (1982) and Rocky V (1990) can briefly be seen in this film sitting in a wheelchair in the background of his bar cheering on Rocky during the fight. Andy originally had a more sizable role, but the scene was cut from the finished film.', u""Although it is not included as a deleted scene on the DVD, Sylvester Stallone has said that a scene was filmed in which Rocky sees a woman that looks like Adrian in the building where Robert, Jr. works. He follows her for a while before he realizes it is not Adrian. Stallone decided to cut the scene because he felt that Rocky's loneliness had already been established enough, and that this scene was overkill."", u'Sylvester Stallone initially wanted Roy Jones, Jr. for the role of Mason Dixon. Stallone claims that he left 31 phone messages for Jones but never received a response.', u'Sylvester Stallone originally wanted to film Rambo (2008) before he could film Rocky Balboa (2006). However, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) gave him the green-light and Stallone had to put Rambo on hold.', u'In the fight between Dixon and Balboa, one of the commentators says, ""Balboa was hit so hard his ancestors must have felt it"" This is possibly a reference to the real fight between Muhammad Ali (then Cassius Clay) and Henry Cooper in 1963. In an interview with Ali after the fight, in which he was knocked down, Ali explained, ""He (Cooper) hit me so hard, my ancestors in Africa felt it.""', u'Assuming standard sized gym weights, during the ""Gonna Fly Now"" workout scene, Rocky was benching 365 pounds, snatch and lifting 315 pounds, and squatting 495 pounds.', u'Mike Tyson improvised his lines.', u""According to Jodi Letizia's lawyer, Sylvester Stallone had promised her that she would reprise her role as Marie in this film. When Letizia learned that that Geraldine Hughes had been cast in the role instead, she filed a lawsuit against Stallone, claiming that she had cleared her entire schedule to prepare for the filming. The lawsuit was eventually settled."", u'Sylvester Stallone trained for six months to get in shape for his role.', u'This is the only Rocky sequel not to contain a recap from its predecessor.', u'Antonio Tarver (the real light heavyweight champion at the time of production) trained for 5 weeks prior to the film and had to put on 25 pounds.', u'This film was shipped to theaters under the code name ""Nobody Parties"".', u'All of the arena material was filmed in HD to match the HBO PPV look; the rest of the film was shot on standard 35mm.', u""The championship belts used in the movie were actually those of Antonio Tarver, who played Mason 'The Line' Dixon. If you look closely in the scene where Steps is looking over Rocky's memorabilia, you'll see on the WBC Championship Belt photos of 'Joe Louis', Muhammad Ali, and two of its owner - Antonio Tarver."", u'In one shot where Rocky walks out of the restaurant to talk to his son you can clearly see him (Rocky) wearing a Dempsy t-shirt/sweater, apparently as a tribute to former world heavyweight champion Jack Dempsey.', u'This is the only film in the Rocky series which actually plays Bill Conti\'s ""Gonna Fly Now"" over the closing credits.', u""Composer Bill Conti only wrote one original piece of music for the film; Marie's theme."", u'There is a subplot about Paulie having a girlfriend that did not make the final cut, however, the deleted scenes can be seen on the DVD.', u""The only Rocky movie where the famous red, white, and blue boxing trunks aren't being worn, even though the trunks are briefly shown through the use of archive footage. In Rocky II (1979), they are only seen in the opening scene, which was the fight from the previous film."", u'According to her gravestone, Adrian Balboa was born on March 10, 1950, and died on January 11, 2002 (""woman cancer"", according to Rocky).', u'This is the only movie in the first six Rocky films not to begin with Rocky in a boxing match.', u'The computer fight was shot with Sylvester Stallone and Antonio Tarver wearing motion capturing outfits.', u""The original title of the film was Rocky VI: Puncher's Chance."", u""In 2005, Sylvester Stallone published a men's fitness magazine called Sly. Although the magazine only lasted four issues, Stallone included portions of his script for this movie, including illustrations of some scenes. The drawing of Mason Dixon does not resemble Antonio Tarver, as the part had not yet been cast."", u""In the end credits where everyone is reenacting Rocky's iconic run up the steps, Sylvester Stallone's wife, Jennifer Flavin, is shown doing it as well."", u'No traditional soundtrack was released for the film. Instead, a CD called ""Rocky Balboa - The Best of Rocky"" was released, featuring a collection of the best songs from the entire franchise. The release date of that compilation album (December 26, 2006) also coincided with the 30th anniversary re-release of the original soundtrack to Rocky (1976).', u'This was the first film that Sylvester Stallone directed since Rocky IV (1985).', u""The fight scene happened right after an actual boxing event, so people who were there for a pay-per-view match got to see the ending scene. This was Sylvester Stallone's choice so he can make the fight as realistic as possible by actually taking and giving hits."", u""James Binns had 2 different characters - Rocky's attorney in Rocky V (1990) and a boxing commissioner in this film."", u'Every main opponent that Rocky faces throughout the series is both taller and heavier than he is.', u'Before the fight between Dixon and Balboa, Mason Dixon is introduced as being from Tampa, Florida. Antonio Tarver (the real-life boxer who plays Dixon) is also from Tampa.', u'The HBO broadcast team for the fight is Jim Lampley, Max Kellerman, and Larry Merchant. Normally, HBO does not use both Kellerman and Merchant on the same broadcast. It would not be until five years later that this trio actually worked a real boxing broadcast together.', u""While the dramatic portions of the movie are shot in an obviously cinematic style, the bout between Balboa and Dixon is shot in several different ways. The lead-in to the bout, as well as the first two rounds, are shot in a style similar to a major pay-per-view broadcast. Clips from fights in previous Rocky movies are used during the introductory teaser to introduce Balboa, while stock footage from actual Tarver fights, as well as footage from Dixon's previous fight (shown at the beginning of the film) are used as clips for Dixon's part of the teaser. The fight itself was shot in high definition to further enhance the television-style look of the fight."", u'According to the behind-the-scenes documentary on the DVD, there were slight continuity problems during the filming of the fight. This was said to have been due to the fact that real punches were thrown by both Sylvester Stallone and Antonio Tarver, resulting in some swelling and nosebleeds earlier than scripted. The DVD release features an alternate ending in which Rocky wins the fight (also by a split decision).', u""At one point in the movie, Rocky cracks a few eggs in a glass and drinks them. It's a nod to the original Rocky (1976) when Rocky does the same thing."", u'In one scene, Rocky mistakenly identifies ""Little"" Marie\'s son and comments that he has her ""big Irish hair"". Even though Rocky is wrong about which boy the son is, actress Geraldine Hughes is, coincidentally, from Ireland.', u""When Duke is talking to Rocky before the training montage, he says that Rocky will have to hit Mason so hard that it will rattle his ancestors. Later, during the final fight scene, Rocky is hit by Mason, and a commentator remarks that Rocky's ancestors must have felt that punch."", u""This was Sylvester Stallone's most successful film since Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over (2003)."", u'A new song, ""Still Here"" by Natasha Bedingfield (written by Diane Warren) was to be featured prominently in the film but was dropped. The song is still listed in the closing credits. The song appears on the UK version of the album ""Rocky Balboa: The Best of Rocky"".', u'In an article of Sports Illustrated, Tommy Morrison, who played the character, Tommy Gunn in Rocky V (1990), tried contacting Sylvester Stallone about reprising his character for this film, but nothing became of it.', u""According to actor Milo Ventimiglia, his casting as Sylvester Stallone's son was due in part to Stallone noticing that they have similar mouth and lip movements when they speak."", u""Adrian's Restaurant is marked as opening since 1995. The same year of the release of two Stallone movies, Judge Dredd (1995) and Assassins (1995)."", u'Under the name of Rocky\'s restaurant ""Adrian\'s"", ""Est. 1995"" appears, meaning that when Rocky meets again with Marie, he has been the owner for eleven years.', u'In 1984, ""Weird Al"" Yankovic made a song called ""Theme from Rocky XIII"" parodying Survivor\'s ""The Eye of the Tiger"" that told of Rocky no longer boxing but now owning a deli and catering service. Parts of the story-line of this movie mirror this song.', u'Around 9 minutes into the film, when Rocky first walks into his restaurant ""Adrian\'s"", he\'s talking to his pregnant hostess and asks ""how\'s your stomach?"" Rocky asks this very same question to his wife, Adrian, in Rocky II (1979).', u'The very last scene to be shot was Rocky\'s sprint up the steps at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Sylvester Stallone purposely left this shot until the end because he knew it would be such an emotional experience due to the iconic nature of the scene, and he felt it was a good way for him to say goodbye to the character. As he puts it himself, ""that run is the distillation of the entire Rocky experience.""', u'Sylvester Stallone was actually knocked unconscious while filming the final fight scene.', u'Stallone\'s original cut of the film ran near 2 1/2 hours. This cut of the film played to sneak preview audiences on May 15th, 2006. This was before MGM demanded Stallone cut the film down to an hour and forty-five minutes (the release print eventually ran an hour and forty-two minutes). Scenes cut out that are not included on the DVD release include:    -After talking with his son, Rocky follows a woman up an escalator, thinking she\'s Adrian. When he gets to her, he discovers she, of course, isn\'t.    -There were many more visits to Adrian\'s grave in the original cut.    -Rocky\'s brain damage being shown to have not been brain damage at all was trimmed from the license scene.    -Two training sequences: one of Rocky doing weight training as well as Mason Dixon doing his training to the tune of Survivor\'s ""Fire Makes Steel"" and afterward was a Rocky-only training sequence scored with ""Gonna Fly Now"". These two sequences were squished together for the final print.    -Before the fight, Marie and Rocky share a hug.    -Rocky says hi to Mike Tyson before the fight.    -The film was also shot with four endings so as not to spoil the end to the watching crowd.

One example is the feature of the bolt-gun which fires bolts directly into rock, forgoing the usual rock-drilling and bolt-hammering used in rock-climbing. This ignores certain material properties of rock that should cause the bolt-gun's impact site to shatter and explode with flaky projectiles. The bolt gun is considered the most serious of the film's technical inaccuracies.

These two films had coincided with the height of Stallone's own popularity, which had waned decidedly in the years since Rocky IV.

Also, many of the Monk extras were in fact real Monks from that very temple who were paid to appear as extras for those scenes (along with additional extras who were merely dressed as Monks for the scene). MacDonald also went on to say how delighted he was to ""give money to people who really needed it, as opposed to people who had too much of it"".', u'The Soviet Spetsnaz troops are wearing the same ""Hollywood knock-off"" camouflage pattern outfits as seen on the Soviet paratroopers in Red Dawn (1984) (an approximation of the Soviet KLMK pattern, supposedly based on poor black and white photos of the genuine uniforms in use).', u'Original director Russell Mulcahy was replaced after two weeks of filming by Peter MacDonald due to creative differences. Three cinematographers also left.', u'The knife in this film is the first in the series to not be designed by Arkansas knifesmith Jimmy Lile. The blade was designed by fantasy knife designer Gil Hibben and is two inches longer than the one in Rambo: First Blood Part II (1985) and three inches longer than the knife in First Blood (1982). The knife is also the first in the series to not be of a survival knife design, although Hibben did produce a hollow handle, sawtooth survival knife. It was used during the first few days of filming: Rambo can be seen using it to pry up a mine in the minefield scene. A closeup of the final design plunging into the sand was filmed later to begin the scene. Jimmy Lile did build a prototype bowie knife roughly similar to what Hibben eventually produced (now being reproduced by knifesmith Vaughan Neeley), but Stallone rejected it, showing Lile a Hibben design more like what he wanted. Not surprisingly, Lile suggested he use Hibben himself.', u""According to director Peter MacDonald in the DVD commentary, at the time this movie was being filmed, the Russians were, in fact, invading Afghanistan just as depicted in this movie, however about four weeks prior to this movie's premiere, the Russians withdrew from Afghanistan, and were no longer at war with that country. MacDonald felt that this turn of events had hurt the movie's box office returns, because the idea of the Russians being the primary villains in this movie was no longer really believable. At the same time though, MacDonald was somewhat glad of the idea that the events of this movie may have helped to contribute to Russia's withdrawal from Afghanistan."", u""Although it has been claimed that the film was banned in parts of the UK after the killing spree of Michael Ryan, and that he was inspired by the Rambo movies, neither was in fact the case. A scheduled screening of the original First Blood (1982) was pulled from UK television (as was a screening of Nevada Smith (1966)), leading the UK's 'Daily Mail' and other media outlets to assume a direct link that never existed and which quickly became a popular urban legend. The film was heavily cut by the BBFC (by 1min 25secs for theatrical release and 3mins 3secs for home video), primarily for knife violence and cruelty to animals, but never banned. The DVD release has all the cuts reinstated apart from a two second shot of animal cruelty, in this case it being a horsefall."", u'The problems that the Russian forces faced with American Stinger missiles supplied to the mujaheddin fighters, as described in this movie, were very real, and accounted for the downing and destruction of hundreds of Russian helicopters during the real war. The missile was used again by Pakistan against better-flown Indian aircraft and gunships in the 1999 Kargil War but only accounted for 1 kill out of several hundred launches.', u'There is no female role in the main cast, and few women appear in the film.', u""The film's ending was longer: In the original cut, as Rambo and Trautman are driving away from the freedom fighter's camp, as seen in the theatrical cut, Rambo decides to not go back with Trautman home to America and Rambo decides to stay with the freedom fighters, feeling that he has finally found somewhere he belongs. Trautman understands and says goodbye to Rambo and wishes him luck and returns home to America alone."", u""Some footage filmed by original director Russell Mulcahy is present in the final cut. The scenes are; the sequence in which Trautman is ambushed by the helicopter and captured, as well as the scene of Rambo sitting on the roof off the temple pondering Trautman's proposition."", u""The Mi-24 Hind-A (large glazed cockpit as opposed to two small tandem cockpits for the later D version onwards of the type) helicopters seen in the film are in fact modified Aerospatiale SA 330 Puma transport helicopters with fabricated bolt-on wings similar to the real Hind-A's used in the former Soviet bloc nations."", u'When Sylvester Stallone ranked his preference of the Rambo films on the UK chat show Graham Norton, he ranked this one 3rd.', u'During filming, Sylvester Stallone had a close call with a spinning helicopter rotor blade. In fact, had he been struck, it would have certainly decapitated him.  Stallone laughed off the near miss with the quip ""at least I\'d have saved a fortune on haircuts!""', u'Five years later, Richard Crenna parodied his role in the spoof Hot Shots! Part Deux (1993). Just like Colonel Trautman, his character personally sought out the main protagonist (played by Charlie Sheen) in a location somewhere in Southeast Asia to ask for help, and was also captured by the enemies forces, this time the Iraqis.', u'""Hot Shots 2: part duex"" (1993) is a parody of Rambo III with almost identical scenes shot the same way with gags thrown in.

Which Stallone was all for and happy for him to poke fun at the Rambo films!', u'Working title was Full Circle: First Blood Part III', u'The other helicopter disguised as a Russian gunship was really an Aerospatiale/Eurocopter SA 341/2 Gazelle (also modified as the title helicopter in the movie Blue Thunder (1983)), of British/French design.

Michael Seresin took over the position, but quit the production along with original director Russell Mulcahy.

In an unfortunate surprise for Thompson, when filming of the movie was finished, director George P. Cosmatos told Thompson, ""You could have been good if you had listened to me.""', u""First draft of Sylvester Stallone's script had lot of differences from later drafts and the film. These include opening shootout taking place in movie theater instead of a grocery store and lot more people getting killed, Cobra mentioning how some psychopath he was trying to catch killed his girlfriend, additional big action sequence taking place during night on a boat where Cobra and Ingrid are hiding when they get attacked by Nightslasher's cult members but Cobra and Gonzalez manage to kill them all, and different ending in which it's revealed that Monte was actual leader of the New Order cult and when he tries to kill Ingrid he gets shot and killed by Cobra."", u'The Stan Bush song ""The Touch"" from The Transformers: The Movie (1986) was originally written for this film.', u'None of the supporting cast or crew were allowed to talk to Sylvester Stallone during filming.', u'The Paula Gosling novel \'Fair Game\' on which ""Cobra"" is based is also called \'A Running Duck\'. When the movie came out Sylvester Stallone allegedly wanted the novel reissued with himself credited as the author. Ms. Gosling declined the offer.', u'In the original script, Nightslasher was called Abaddon.', u""Much of David Rasche's role was cut from the final version. In the behind-the-scenes documentary, an additional scene featuring him is shown being filmed."", u'The first cut of the movie featured a different, less dialogue-heavy version of Nightslasher and Cobretti\'s final confrontation. Cobretti originally appeared after Nightslasher screams ""We are the future!"" and reprised his ""You\'re the disease, and I\'m the cure"" line from the opening supermarket scene. Cobra attempts to shoot Nightstalker but is jumped by Stalk, only to be accidentally shot by Nightslasher. This would have led into the hand-to-hand fight seen in the final version.', u""For Nightslasher's monologue in the final confrontation with Cobra, Brian Thompson did the scene with the script girl because Sylvester Stallone was off watching a basketball game on television."", u'Originally, the motorcycle chase scene in the ending was to be filmed in Seattle during the night on a ferry between the islands. Even though everything was prepared to start filming the scene at night, Sylvester Stallone ordered for the ending to be changed and to happen during the day because of the mosquito problem at that time which would have made night-time filming very difficult to endure.', u'In 2017, Sylvester Stallone used his Instagram page to post a picture of Cobretti standing next to the 1950 Mercury car with the caption, ""Comeback or throwback?"" Thousands of fans used this as the opportunity to lobby Stallone for a sequel or director\'s cut Blu-ray of the film.', u'The submachine gun used by Marion Cobretti in the final showdown with biker gang is a Jati-Matic. The Jati-Matic first appeared in the early 1980s, but was never adopted by any country for use. It re-appeared in Finland in the mid-1990s as the GG-95 Personal Defense Weapon made by the Golden Gun Company. The gun is chambered in 9x19 parabellum, has a cyclic rate of 600 rounds per minute, and has various accessories that were offered, such as a silencer, various capacity magazines, and a laser pointing device.', u'Cobretti uses a custom Colt Gold Cup National Match 1911 in 9mm using Glaser Safety Slugs, a frangible bullet. This is shown when he unloads his pistol in his apartment to clean it. The Colt Gold Cup National Match 1911 is usually chambered in .45 caliber ACP. The 9mm versions were made especially for the film.', u'Sylvester Stallone was a fan of John Cafferty and The Beaver Brown Band and approached them about doing a song for the film. The song ""Voice of America\'s Sons"" was written for the film, and John Cafferty had contributed to the Rocky IV soundtrack as well.', u'Andrew Robinson and Reni Santoni also appeared in Dirty Harry (1971). In both films, Santoni plays a police officer named Gonzales, while in the earlier film Robinson (credited as Andy Robinson) played the main antagonist.', u'The official soundtrack release includes a track called ""Skyline"" which is not heard anywhere in the movie. This is because scenes in which this track was used were cut out from the movie during re-editing. Originally there was a scene in which Cobretti is sitting in his home, looking at a sunset (there is a similar scene in the beginning of theatrical version in which he is cleaning up his gun and then looks at streets outside of his house) and soon, right after Nightslasher and his gang members killed the second victim and cops show up at the scene, Cobretti gets the call from his police chief or somebody else to go and meet with them and it is in this scene where the ""Skyline"" track is heard. ""Skyline"" was also originally used in some other scenes including the ending but from some reason it was removed and replaced with the song ""Voice Of America\'s Sons"" by John Cafferty.', u'In the diner scene where Cobretti brings over the fake hamburger to Ingrid, there is an oval frame on the wall that says ""King Cobra"" - a brand of beer.', u""Much of Nightslasher's attack on Ingrid in the hospital scene was cut for pacing and content. The deaths of the janitor and nurse were originally shown onscreen, and Nightslasher was also meant to kill the police officer guarding Ingrid. Two later scenes - Cobretti and Gonzales taking Ingrid out of the hospital, and Cobretti talking with Monte - originally included mentions of the officer's death. These were cut to avoid continuity errors, but as a result the editing in both scenes is choppy."", u'Santiago Segura has claimed that this movie was the inspiration for his well-known character Jose Luis Torrente, main star of Torrente - lain tyhm\xe4 k\xe4si (1998) and sequels, that he conceived as a parody of the 80s action movies. In fact, the title is a spoof of Stallone\'s movie, since then in Spain Cobra was titled as ""Cobra, el brazo fuerte de la ley"" (Cobra, the strong arm of the law).', u'Sylvester Stallone said he got the idea for the LAPD\'s ""Zombie Squad"" from a real-life Zombie Squad in Belgium, comprised of cops who go out at night and handle crazed criminals on their own terms.', u""In the original rough cut the car chase scene between Cobra and Nightslasher was longer and ended differently. While in the theatrical version Nightslasher shoots at Cobra's car and causes him to crash into the boat, in the original version Nightslasher and his driver crash into the boat first, and Cobra fails to stop his car and crashes into them. The shot of Nightslasher's car and him sighing in relief was re-purposed from an earlier part of the chase and the shot of Cobra seeing the boat before he crashes into it was actually taken from Nightslasher's car crash. However if you watch the theatrical version of this scene closely you can still see Nightslasher's crashed car right when Cobra's car crashes into the boat."", u'Al Leong was initially cast as one of the lead villains. His role was eliminated following protests by an advocacy group that objected to the casting of an Asian villain.', u""The movie is filled with over-the-top 1980s product placement. 1. Pepsi machine and Coors display and can in first shoot-out. 2. Giant Pepsi sign beside Stallone's apartment. 3. Toys R Us commercial which Stallone watches on television. 4. Pepsi sign lit up at night outside Stallone's apartment - background for fight scene. 5. Coors California sign in store window. 6. Coca-Cola machine outside store with character drinking can of Coke. 7. Bar scene with Miller High-Life sign in background."", u'The bobble-head doll that Cobra is playing with outside the diner is wearing the uniform of the Philadelphia Phillies.', u'In an interview Sylvester Stallone described the character of Marion Cobretti as ""Bruce Springsteen with a badge.""', u'In the first draft of the script by Sylvester Stallone, the opening sequence took place at a movie theater, not a supermarket.', u""Incorrectly regarded as a goof: When Cabretti spins his pistol cowboy-style in the supermarket, it's incorrectly regarded as a goof that the semi-automatic would have fired when twirled. The Colt National Match pistol he carried has a grip safety that prevents the trigger being pulled unless gripped properly. Regardless, it's unwise and irresponsible to play with firearms.""]","[u'Poland::1986', u'USA::23 May 1986', u'Netherlands::10 July 1986', u'Taiwan::19 July 1986', u'Australia::24 July 1986', u'Colombia::24 July 1986', u'UK::1 August 1986', u'Ireland::1 August 1986', u'Spain::8 August 1986 (Madrid)', u'Japan::9 August 1986', u'Brazil::11 August 1986', u'Denmark::15 August 1986', u'Uruguay::21 August 1986', u'Finland::12 September 1986', u'Argentina::25 September 1986', u'West Germany::2 October 1986', u'Portugal::17 October 1986', u'France::22 October 1986', u'Greece::22 October 1986', u'Italy::24 October 1986', u'South Korea::20 June 1987', u'Hungary::28 January 1988', u'Sweden::13 May 1988', u'Turkey::6 July 1990', u'Belgium::5 March 2015 (Offscreen Film Festival)']",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Lundgren threw Weathers across the ring before it was broken up.', u""When shooting the film, Sylvester Stallone decided that for the shooting of the fight, he and Dolph Lundgren should hit one another for real, so as to increase the intensity of the scene. After doing three takes of Rocky taking shots to ribs, Stallone felt a burning in his chest, but ignored it. Later that night, he had difficulty breathing and was taken to a nearby emergency room. It was discovered that his blood pressure was over 200, and he had to be flown on a low-altitude flight from Canada to St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica, where he remained in intensive care for four days. What had happened was that Lungren had punched him so hard in the chest, Stallone's heart had slammed up against his breastbone and began to swell, cutting off the blood supply and restricting the oxygen flow throughout the body."", u'Carl Weathers nearly quit the film when Dolph Lundgren tossed Weathers into the corner of the boxing ring. Weathers shouted profanities at Lundgren while leaving the ring and announcing that he was calling his agent and quitting the movie. Only after Sylvester Stallone forced the two actors to reconcile did the movie continue. This event caused a four-day work stoppage while Weathers was talked back into the part and Lundgren agreed to tone down his aggressiveness.', u""If you look carefully at the very opening scene (the American glove and the Russian glove colliding), you can see that a split second after the gloves collide and a split second before they're covered by the explosion, the Russian glove breaks in half and falls to the ground."", u'Over 8,000 people auditioned for the part of Ivan Drago.', u'According to Sylvester Stallone, Ivan Drago returned home in disgrace and became addicted to alcohol and steroids before committing suicide.', u'During a practice round, Sylvester Stallone told Dolph Lundgren to ""really go at it"" like how normal boxers do for 15 seconds. He ended up with a swelling pericardia sac around his heart and had to be rushed to the emergency room by plane. His insurance company thought he was faking it, saying that his injuries looked more ""from head-on collisions when the steering wheels hit you in the chest"". Stallone replied, ""Have you seen Dolph Lundgren?! That\'s a truck! That\'s a steering wheel! That\'s a head-on collision!"" His insurance company honored the claim soon after that.', u'Rocky IV was the highest grossing film in the Rocky series, taking in just over 300 million dollars worldwide.', u'It took Dolph Lundgren about six months to win the part and was first turned down by the casting directors for being too tall. Later, he got the chance to send photos and meet Sylvester Stallone who told him he had a good chance to get the part, but advised him to gain twenty pounds of muscle.', u'The ""hit the one in the middle"" exchange, long part of boxing lore, actually did happen during the Max Baer-Max Schmeling heavyweight fight in June 1933. Baer was knocked groggy by a Schmeling right hand in the first round and told his corner, ""I see three of him out there."" Ex-champ Jack Dempsey, who was in Baer\'s corner for the fight, responded with the famous line, and Baer went on to score a tenth-round knockout.', u'In the Italian dub of the movie, Ivan Drago\'s line ""I must break you"", was translated as ""I break you in two"" (""Ti spiezzo in due"", complete with fake Russian accent).

Sylvester Stallone incorporated these ideas by not giving the character too much dialogue and making big close ups, especially in the eyes.', u'Tony Burton, who has a brief scene in this film playing chess against a Russian opponent, is an accomplished chess player in real life, having once defeated master chessman and director Stanley Kubrick on the set of The Shining (1980).', u'Assuming they are standard weight lifting plates, Ivan Drago is pressing (standing press) 455 pounds.', u'The training scenes set in Russia were actually filmed in Wyoming.

This is most likely because the scene explaining what would happen to the belt was cut from the film, and replaced with a newspaper montage. Initially, between Apollo's funeral and the Rocky/Drago press conference, there was to be a scene in which Rocky visits the U.S. boxing board. While there, he is told that they will not sanction the fight, and if he goes ahead with it, he will not be allowed to carry the title.

Dobbins) suffered a broken back (a compression lumbar fracture) as a result of a seventy mile per hour first take that launched the car to a remarkable height on the ramp assisted steep approach to the railway crossing. The vehicle slammed down flat on its chassis, causing the injury to Dobbins, and it rolled several hundred feet further up the road before coming to a stop. When Dobbins opened the door to exit he found himself unable to walk and he fell to the ground. This original high jump and landing was re-shot and replaced in the final cut, with a more modest and believable car jump and landing, using a different car and stunt driver.', u'A scene was filmed but never used where Rambo, while in the cave after dispatching Teasle and his men, has another flashback: he and his buddies are in a bar in Vietnam, being entertained by the local women.

The goal was to create a knife that could be reliable for extreme survival situations, including being long and sharp enough to slice food or cut wood; waterproof and able to hold necessities like matches and medicine; able to carry a nylon string for fishing or snaring; and have an alternate blade of sawteeth for defense and in order to cut poles for shelter. In all, six knives were created to be used during production, with additional updated versions made for subsequent movies in the series.', u'After Kirk Douglas pulled out due to script differences at the last minute after being cast as Colonel Trautman, the producers rushed to replace him. They tried Rock Hudson first, who was recovering from open heart surgery and turned it down. They then offered it to Richard Crenna, who accepted the Friday before filming began the following week. Crenna had to ask the script supervisor constantly to feed him his lines until he was able to get caught up with memorizing the part.', u'It is often claimed that in Japanese, ""rambo"" means ""violence"".

It is also identical in pronunciation to the Japanese title of the film.', u'Shortly after the novel was published in 1972, Columbia Pictures bought the filming rights at the behest of producer Lawrence Turman for a reported 75,000 dollars. Richard Brooks was originally attached to direct. Brooks spent a year on the project, researching it and writing a never completed 115 page script, which was to place more emphasis on the character of the Sheriff, and end with an unarmed Rambo being killed. Brooks did not have an actor in mind for Rambo but wanted Lee Marvin, or Burt Lancaster, to play the Sheriff, and Bette Davis to play a psychiatrist who deals with Rambo. However, Brooks was not happy with the script and did not want to make the film when Columbia wanted to, and the project fell apart.', u'David Morrell said that the novel and character Rambo is a distillation of the symptoms of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, and the signs of challenge of authority exhibited by university students who are younger than him. The novel is also a result of several discussion sessions organized by him after lectures aimed at the select group of students who have returned from a tour of duty in Vietnam.', u'After the success of Convoy (1978), Kris Kristofferson was considered as a possible choice for John Rambo. Some felt the former Airborne Ranger would make a solid Rambo, and they hoped his good friend Sam Peckinpah could be persuaded to direct.', u'Chuck Norris said in an interview that the makers of Rambo at one point brought up the possibility of him playing Rambo.', u'John Calley at Warner Bros. spent 125,000 dollars to acquire the project from Columbia. Clint Eastwood and Robert De Niro were discussed for the lead and Martin Ritt agreed to direct from a script by Walter Newman, who did three drafts. In this version, both Rambo and the sergeant died, and Trautman, ""the true villain of the piece"", according to Ritt, was allowed to live. Ritt says he wanted Robert Mitchum to play the Sheriff, and Paul Newman to play Rambo.', u""Initially Mike Nichols was interested in directing and wanted Dustin Hoffman to play the lead. Hoffman wasn't interested, however, as he thought it was too violent."", u""It was later estimated there were eighteen versions of the script.

However Milius' producer, Buzz Feitshans eventually produced the movie after the original producer, Ed Carlin, died of a heart attack."", u'There are two possible alternate endings thought of or considered by Michael Kozoll, William Sackheim and Sylvester Stallone. The first would had seen Colonel Trautman forced to shoot and kill Rambo, just as Rambo is about to shoot the injured Teasle and kill him. The other ending would had seen Rambo run out of the police station in slow-motion, opening fire at the police, but, the police shoot and kill Rambo.', u""Brian Dennehy was Ted Kotcheff's only choice to play Teasle."", u'Sydney Pollack considered doing the film in late 1974 with Steve McQueen as Rambo and Burt Lancaster as the Sheriff.

Ted Kotcheff saw the project through his friend (later agent), then studio vice-president Robert Shapiro, and developed it for three months before the studio decided to pull the plug on the project, due to the signing of the Paris Peace Accords.

Sackheim wanted to make the film with director John Badham starring John Travolta as Rambo, George C. Scott as Trautman and Gene Hackman or Charles Durning as the Sheriff. Sackheim spent eight months on the project but could not get finance.', u'Ted Kotcheff had been approached with the project in 1976. He only returned to work on it after Mario Kassar and Andrew G.

For the scene where Rambo jumps off the cliff and injures himself on some tree branches on the way down, Stallone performs the stunt himself during the bottom third of the fall, and in the process, broke one of his ribs when he landed on the tree branch. Stallone remarks on the DVD commentary that it was easy to play the landing when Rambo screams in pain, since he was not acting and was really in pain. Also for the scene where Rambo first runs into the abandoned mine shaft to elude the guardsmen firing at him, Stallone places his hand on top of a piece of wood, not realizing that his hand was right on top of a gunfire squib that went off a second later, injuring his hand in the process. Stallone mentions that the pain he felt was so intense, he was afraid to look at his hand, fearing the squib had completely blown his thumb off.', u'This film has a reputation of being overly violent. However, the total body count of the movie is one: Galt falling from the helicopter. All others survive, even Teasle.', u'In the script Rambo originally kills 18 people. While Ted Kotcheff described the killings as target practice, co-producer Andrew G. Vajna felt it was glorifying a crazed mass murderer thus suggested that Rambo should instead be a sympathetic person who is really lost without direction and a victim of circumstances. Thus in the final film, he was never seen killing a person directly.', u""In his commentary, author David Morell cites the inspiration for John Rambo as being World War II hero, and later Hollywood actor Audie Murphy. In Rambo (2008), the latest film of the series, the character's last stand in the finale is very similar to how Murphy was awarded the Medal of Honor, manning a vehicle mounted .50 calibre machine gun, and singlehandedly holding off hundreds of enemy soldiers."", u'Numerous sound bites of this film were lifted and used in the 1989 arcade version of Golden Axe (1989). The two most notable sounds used were that of Deputy Sergeant Galt, as he falls to his death from a helicopter, and that of Mitch, after he is stabbed by Rambo in the leg in order to draw the other officers to his aid.', u'In the book, Trautman was brought in to kill Rambo because he had trained him. Thus, he was the only one who could stop him.', u'Kirk Douglas was originally cast to play Colonel Samuel Trautman.

In the film, Galt is killed when he falls out of the helicopter, shortly after he deliberately unbuckles his safety belt.', u""In Rambo: The Video Game (2014). The player, as John Rambo, can kill the Sheriff's Deputies, The National Guardsmen, and other policemen. In this film, Rambo does not kill anymore, besides Galt which was accidental. In the novel, Rambo kills the cops and the National Guardsmen."", u'The 1983 broadcast of the film in Canada featured scenes that were cut from the theatrical version, and the following deleted scenes were not on the special features on the DVD and Blu-ray releases: Rambo checking the bullets in Galt\'s pistols.

Additional dialogue between Teasle, Kern and Trautman. Extra footage of Rambo in the caves and Teasle offering to drive Trautman to the airport.', u""In the final scene when Rambo has an emotional breakdown with Col. Trautman, the story he tells Trautman about his friend and fellow Baker teammate Danforth (involving the '58 Chevy Convertible and the wired shoe box that blows up, mortally wounding him) was actually a true story told to Sylvester Stallone by a Vietnam War veteran who had had a similar traumatizing experience during the war."", u""The film is not as violent as the book. In the film, Rambo does not kill anymore - he wounds Teasle's Deputies and puts them out of action. Only one man is killed - Deputy Sergeant Art Galt. Galt is accidentally killed when he falls out of the helicopter, due to his own stupidity, because he removed his safety belt."", u""Some minor details are altered and/or changed or omitted. Some examples include: in the novel, Teasle was a Marine Corps veteran of the Korean War, whereas in the movie (indicated by his medals) he is a U.S. Army veteran of the Korean War. In the novel, Deputy Galt is a young rookie officer, clumsy and inexperienced. He is killed by Rambo purposefully (in the film, he's accidentally killed when the helicopter jerks and he falls). In addition, he's also an older officer with experience, albeit with a brutal streak in stark contrast to the clumsy Galt which appears in the novel. The beginning of the novel finds John Rambo attempting to hitch a ride from a gas station, as opposed to the film where he's searching for an old Army buddy. A subplot involving Teasle attempting to get in touch with his estranged wife is absent from the film, but present in the novel. The animal Rambo has for dinner is an owl in the novel, but a wild boar in the film. In the novel, Rambo has been said to have fought with his father and been drafted to fight in the Vietnam War; the film makes no mention of this, but Rambo does mention having a father and quite possibly going home to see him in Rambo (2008). The novel also has a slightly different ending: in the novel, both Rambo and Teasle die. Rambo is put out of his misery by Colonel Trautman and Teasle dies of injuries inflicted on him by Rambo. The movie ending finds Rambo surrendering after suffering a breakdown and Teasle being wheeled away to a hospital after being shot numerous times by Rambo (his fate is left ambiguous). Teasle's background is explored more in the novel, including him and Orval being old friends and Teasle being present at the battle of the Chosin Reservoir."", u""Spoiler for both the Film and the Novel) When Sheriff Teasle and Col. Trautman chat in the bar, Teasle asks Trautman what he would have done had he had confronted Rambo face-to-face: Hug him or blow his brains out. As it turns out, he does both depending on the ending for the film or for the novel. In the film's ending, Rambo has an emotional breakdown and Trautman hugs him in consolation. In the novel's ending, Trautman shoots Rambo with a shotgun, killing him."", u'The helicopter pilot does not tell Teasle or Trautman about Galt trying to kill him, and that Galt threatened to kill him, and that Rambo did not kill Galt.', u""Body count;- 1.

Apollo and Duke\'s shirts say ""Rocky"" on the back. However, Paulie\'s shirt says ""Paulie"" on the back.', u'Even though the film opened six years after the original, the story is set only four years beyond the original. Rocky is introduced as 30 in the first Apollo Creed fight and is introduced as 34 before the rematch with Clubber Lang. This is because the movie is set three years after Rocky II (1979) which was supposed to be the following year after the original.', u'According to Sylvester Stallone, Clubber Lang later became a born-again Christian and a ringside announcer.', u'When interviewed before the rematch Clubber says ""No, I don\'t hate Balboa, but I pity the fool"". ""I pity the fool"" would become a catch phrase used by Mr. T in many other times during his career, and this was his first time using it.', u""In 1981, as an eight-year-old living in Philadelphia's Lawncrest neighborhood, Nikol Bird went door to door, gathering signatures to keep the eight-foot, six-inch, one ton bronze statue of Rocky Balboa forever at the top of the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art. The city had refused to keep the prop in front of the world-class museum, and Sylvester Stallone shipped the statue back to Los Angeles. But little Nikol mounted a campaign to bring the statue back.  She set up a table outside Veterans Stadium the night Pete Rose passed Stan Musial on the list of all-time hits leader, and gathered 2,000 signatures. In all, she collected more than 10,000 and presented them to City Council. Stallone was grateful. The statue was put back at the steps briefly in 1982 for the opening of Rocky III, and Stallone hoisted Nikol above his head at the dedication ceremony, then escorted her to the premiere at the Sameric on Chestnut Street."", u""According to Chuck Wepner, the match between Rocky and Thunderlips was based on Wepner's match with Andr\xe9 the Giant. Wepner was tossed out of the ring in the same way that Rocky is in the film."", u""Artist LeRoy Neiman makes a cameo appearance as the ring announcer in the Rocky-Thunderlips charity match. Neiman would also appear in Rocky IV (1985), Rocky V (1990) and Rocky Balboa (2006). A painting by Neiman featuring Rocky and Apollo is shown in the closing credits, and can also be seen in Rocky's restaurant in Rocky Balboa (2006). LeRoy Neiman also appeared in Rocky II (1979). He was the artist wearing the white suit and white hat sketching Apollo while he was training for his rematch with Rocky."", u""The fact that Mickey Goldmill turns out to be Jewish was surprising to fans and even Sylvester Stallone himself, as much of the material involving the character for the first two movies and scenes before his death strongly hinted he was Irish-American. The main reason for highlighting Mickey's ethnicity was the film's wish to pay tribute to the many Jewish Americans who had been successful trainers throughout boxing history, as many of these real people were as old or older than Burgess Meredith when this film released in 1982."", u""John G. Avildsen was approached to direct, but turned it down. Despite the fiasco of Sylvester Stallone's Paradise Alley (1978), Alvidsen encouraged Stallone to direct it."", u'Stallone told Johnny Carson in 1982 that he and Mr. T decided to ""go all out"" from the middle to the end of their last round.', u'On the Ring Magazine World title belt, there were four side plates with pictures of fighters: Floyd Patterson, Jim Braddock, John L. Sullivan, and George Foreman.', u'In this, as with nearly all Rocky films, the ringside cameras are the actual film cameras shooting the fight scenes. Along side the fake television cameras, they almost blend in except for the lenses are clearly film lens and the presence of the focus puller give them away.', u'Part of a cycle of ring fighter movies, mostly boxing, some wrestling, initiated by the box-office and critical success of the Academy Award Best Picture winning boxing movie Rocky (1976). The films include Rocky II (1979), Rocky III (1982), Rocky IV (1985), Tough Enough (1983), Title Shot (1979), _Raging Bull (1980)_, The Champ (1979), Matilda (1978), The Main Event (1979), The Prize Fighter (1979), The Greatest (1977), Body and Soul (1981), Paradise Alley (1978), ...All the Marbles (1981) (aka ""The California Dolls""), The One and Only (1978), Every Which Way But Loose (1978) and Any Which Way You Can (1980).', u'Stallone told Johnny Carson in 1982 that he fought Ernie Shavers and got hurt.', u""On the beach, Rocky sees himself in a fight flashback wearing Apollo's trunks before they were given to him. This is neither a continuity nor editing mistake. As most films are not made chronologically, the second Rocky/Clubber bout was filmed before the beach running scene. To emphasize the degree of punishment Rocky endured during the first fight, they incorporated a clip from the second in which Clubber delivers a heavy body shot. A first time viewer would not immediately notice the different style of trunks."", u'This and Rocky Balboa are the only Rocky movies that never once does Rocky ever say his opponents name.', u'The only odd numbered Rocky movie directed by Slyvester Stallone.', u'Rocky tells his son the story of Goldilocks and the Three Bears. In the film Grumpier Old Men (1995) Burgess Merideth (""Mickey"") tells his granddaughter the story of Goldilocks, albeit with a comic twist.', u""Mickey's last name, Goldmill, appears on his grave marker, the first reference to his last name in the film series."", u'Even though it was left ambiguous, it was later revealed in Creed that Apollo won the friendly fight between him and Rocky in the gym at the end.', u'The rematch with Clubber Lang at the end of this film is the last time in the series Rocky fights for the title. In Rocky IV (1985), the end fight with Ivan Drago is not sanctioned by the American boxing board (a fact that is confirmed by a commentator before the fight). In Rocky V (1990), Rocky didn\'t fight in the ring. In Rocky Balboa (2006), the end fight was an exhibition bout against the reigning champion, Mason ""the Line"" Dixon.', u'According to his grave marker, Mickey was 76 years-old when he died. The character is actually two years older than Burgess Meredith.', u'When Rocky and Apollo are about to fight at the end, Rocky says, ""Boy, you sure move good for an older guy.""   This is different in real life.

In the film, this manifests itself in terms of people quickly forgetting about Rocky's exploits in the title fight. In reality, Stallone experienced a similar sense of being quickly forgotten after his two post-Rocky (1976) movies, Paradise Alley (1978) (Stallone's directorial debut) and F.I.S.T.

Avildsen, in a 1980s newspaper interview, one of the main reasons behind his not directing this sequel, besides preparing for his role as director for Saturday Night Fever (1977), from which he was eventually fired, was that he didn't approve of the story. Although, he was fond of Stallone's original concepts for the two films which would have made the series a trilogy. The plots would have consisted of Rocky going into politics, running for Mayor of Philadelphia on the Reform Ticket, and winning. Only to have be scandalized, when Paulie is caught stealing from the treasury. Rocky honorably takes the blame himself, and is kicked out of office, and ends up penniless just as he had at the beginning of the series.

Thirty-six year old Wepner was considered a moderate talent, but no one thought he had a hope against Ali. Indeed, no one expected Wepner to last more than three rounds. As such, the longer the fight went on past the opening three rounds, the more shocked people became; Wepner even managed to knock Ali down in the ninth round (although Ali has always maintained that Wepner was standing on his foot when he fell). Ali immediately opened a blistering offensive in an attempt to drop Wepner and for the next six rounds, he pummeled Wepner mercilessly, breaking his nose and opening large gashes above both his eyes. No matter how hard Ali hit him however, Wepner kept moving forward and continuing to fight (it was this specific aspect of the fight which inspired Stallone). Eventually, with 19 seconds left in the fifteenth and final round, Ali scored a TKO.

Brown, who was from Philadelphia, was getting ready to fly to Los Angeles to try to sell his newly invented Steadicam device. He had shot some test footage following people around corridors and from room to room, but he wanted to be able to shoot something that even the most experienced filmmakers would look at and wonder how he did it. He came up with the idea for his girlfriend to run up and down the museum steps while he followed close behind her. Using this footage, Brown sold the camera on his first day in Los Angeles and, several months later, John G. Avildsen, who was prepping Rocky, saw the footage and felt that a similar type of shot would be perfect for the film.

He, Weathers and Stallone all went to a ring and began to block out the moves, but it wasn't working, and the fight was coming across as staged and not very energetic. After stuntmen/fight choreographers Paul Stader and George P. Wilbur resigned due to creative disagreements, Avildsen then told Stallone to go home and literally write out the fight; 'Rocky throws a left, Creed moves back, Creed goes right, Rocky goes right Creed jabs low etc'. The next day, Stallone returned with 32 pages of specific directions for the fight, which he and Weathers learned off like a ballet over a period of a few weeks. In total, Stallone and Weathers rehearsed for over 35 hours."", u'Originally, the filmmakers wanted several former heavyweight champions to appear at the beginning of the fight between Rocky and Apollo. They put out a call for all former champions to show, but on the day of the shoot only Joe Frazier turned up. The filmmakers thought it worked well however, because Frazier is a resident of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, which was where the movie was shot and took place.', u'The film was ultimately green-lit by United Artists by a misunderstanding of sorts. Mike Medavoy was the United Artist\'s top man in Los Angeles, and he loved the project, but he needed to convince the head office in New York City. Arthur Krim, United Artists CEO at the time, said he\'d consider it, but he wanted to know more about the writer Sylvester Stallone, who was also going to star. Stallone had recently appeared in a film called The Lords of Flatbush (1974), where he had also gotten a writing credit for \'additional dialogue\'. Medavoy thought Stallone was excellent in the piece, so he sent a copy of the film to New York City, and told them to watch it. The film is about a Brooklyn street gang, and alongside Stallone, it featured unknowns Perry King, Henry Winkler and Paul Mace. During the screening, Krim asked the executives viewing the film, ""Which one is Stallone?"", and someone told him that it was the blond kid (actually Perry King). Krim pointed out that that guy didn\'t look Italian, and Stallone was an Italian name, to which he was told Stallone must be from Northern Italy, where there are a lot of blue eyed, blond haired Italians. Krim thought about this for a moment and then announced that he liked this guy Stallone (still talking about King), and so he green-lit the movie. Several months later, when he realized his mistake, Krim was far from amused.', u""The photos on Rocky's mirror are actual photos of Sylvester Stallone as a young boy."", u""During the scene where Gazzo (Joe Spinell) is talking to Rocky about not breaking the dock worker's thumbs, Gazzo pulls out an inhaler mid-sentence and uses it. That wasn't written into the script; Spinell actually had an asthma attack and really had to use his inhaler right on-camera on the spur of the moment. John G.

Early in his life, Burt Young had been a small-time boxer like Rocky. Young looked it over, and made a few small suggestions before Stallone brought the scripted bout to the director.', u""Talia Shire's character, Adrian Pennino, was named after Shire's grandfather Francesco Pennino."", u'For the championship fight, the filmmakers had trouble getting extras to fill the arena because it was a low-budget film that was not yet known to anyone.

The painting depicts Christ calling Matthew from his life of obscurity literally into miraculous light. As Apollo Creed selects Rocky in much the same way, the picture carries obvious thematic resonance.', u'As he would with all of the Rocky films, writer Sylvester Stallone incorporated a great deal of biographical material into the screenplay. In particular, Stallone used his own frustration to make it as an actor as a template for the frustration of the Rocky character to make it as a boxer. As Stallone himself explains it, ""I took my story and injected it into the body of Rocky Balboa because no one, I felt, would be interested in listening to or watching or reading a story about a down-and-out, struggling actor/writer.

He met with the producers to audition for another film, but was turned down for the part. In the course of conversation Stallone mentioned that he was not only an actor, but also a writer. As he started to leave the room, the producers asked him if he was working on any scripts. That's when Stallone pitched them the story for Rocky (1976) and the producers asked to read the script."", u'Parts of the scene where Rocky runs up the stairs in training are played backwards.

But even though it was not part of his deal, Stallone haunted the editing room while John G. Avildsen assembled the rough cut, and continued to make unsolicited recommendations on how to improve the film. The director didn\'t like his star\'s meddling, but he found an unexpected bonus in Stallone\'s presence. There were several scenes with background voices on television screens and over loudspeakers that normally would have to be dubbed by paid actors. Stallone did them for free, a service appreciated by director and money-conscious producers.', u'This was the third movie in five years that Talia Shire was in that won Best Picture (The Godfather (1972) & The Godfather: Part II (1974) were the other two).

This is a reference to a real life incident. On September 14, 1923, 82,000 people packed into New York's Polo Grounds to watch world heavyweight champion Jack Dempsey face Argentinean no-hoper Luis Angel Firpo. Dempsey immediately began to pummel Firpo, knocking him down seven times within the first two minutes. Somehow however, in the middle of the first round, Firpo managed to land a right uppercut with such force that it literally knocked Dempsey out of the ring.

They did agree, however, on the resolution to the Rocky-Adrian story. On viewing the rough cut, it was clear there was something missing. Adrian had more or less faded from the movie as the focus switched to the big fight with Apollo Creed.

Sylvester Stallone knew that HBO had an upcoming PPV event with Bernard Hopkins taking on Jermaine Taylor in the main event, at the Mandalay Resort and Casino in Las Vegas. Stallone suggested that the film could piggyback the real event, using the real HBO format, the real crowd, even the real press conference setup. As such, the press conference scene was shot only moments after the real press conference with Hopkins and Taylor, whilst the scene when Rocky walks through the curtain and down to the ring was shot using the real Hopkins/Taylor crowd. Stallone was hoping that the crowd wouldn't boo or cause any problems, but as he made his way to the ring (as Rocky), the whole building gave him a standing ovation and began to chant 'ROCKY, ROCKY'. The crowd was never told to stand up or to chant - they had done it completely on their own, and according to the filmmakers, by far the biggest cheer of the night was for Rocky, not for any of the real fighters."", u""The bout between Rocky and Dixon was filmed with actors Sylvester Stallone and Antonio Tarver really hitting one another. According to Stallone, not a single punch in the fight was pulled, and every hit on film was a hit for real. Furthermore, Stallone has revealed that the scene where Rocky is knocked down for a 9 count, and is trying to get to his feet by taking hold of the rope, but is having difficulty focusing on it, is completely genuine; Tarver really did knock him down, and he really couldn't get up."", u'According to Sylvester Stallone, the shot of Rocky standing alone on the museum steps before the second set of end credits was actually filmed without him knowing.', u'According to Stallone, Carl Weathers does not appear in the film because Weathers wanted a role in the film, even though his character Apollo Creed had died in Rocky IV (1985); Stallone refused, so Weathers refused to grant Stallone permission to use archive footage of him. The brief clip of the fight between Rocky and Apollo was recreated using a body double.', u""The film was partially inspired by the George Foreman-Michael Moorer fight in 1994. Foreman had formerly retired from boxing in 1977, but in 1987, the 38 year old had decided to make a comeback. This comeback culminated in 1994 when the, by then, 45 year old Foreman, challenged the 26 year old world heavyweight champion Michael Moorer. The fight took place on November 5 in Las Vegas. For nine rounds, Moorer toyed with Foreman, easily out-boxing him. Entering the tenth round, Foreman was trailing on all scorecards. However, in the tenth round, completely out of nowhere, Foreman landed a vicious shot to Moorer's chin, knocking the younger man out and scoring a TKO victory, becoming the oldest world heavyweight champion in history."", u'Until Creed (2015), Sylvester Stallone insisted that this would be the last Rocky film.', u'The film contains flashbacks from every Rocky film except Rocky V (1990).', u'Pedro Lovell reprises his role as Spider Rico, the boxer defeated by Rocky in the opening scene of Rocky (1976).', u'Sylvester Stallone said that he decided to make this movie, because he was so unhappy with the ending of Rocky V (1990). He actually wanted to make this film back in 1999, but it would not get green-lit until six years later.', u'All of the Rocky training scenes in the gym were shot in one 17-hour shoot.', u""The film was shot in 38 days. The very first thing to be shot was the fight between Dixon and Rocky. This was done because Sylvester Stallone's training (which had been going on for six months) had to stop once the film went into production and he began to concentrate on directing. If the fight had been left until the end of the schedule, Stallone would not have been in as good shape as he was at the start."", u'According to Sylvester Stallone in his DVD Commentary, he did consider having his real-life son Sage Stallone reprise the role of Robert ""Rocky"" Jr. which he had played in Rocky V (1990), but he decided against it because he feared people would read too much into the personal conflict between Rocky and Robert regarding Robert\'s belief that he is ""living in his father\'s shadow"".', u'In the scene in the meat factory between Paulie and Rocky, Paulie asks if Rocky is angry because they took down his statue, a possible reference to the real life controversy which surrounded the statue. During the making of Rocky III (1982), a 9ft tall, 1500-pound bronze statue designed by A. Thomas Schomberg was placed at the top of the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Arts. After filming wrapped, Sylvester Stallone tried to donate the statue to the museum but they said they didn\'t want it, sparking a huge debate between the Museum and the City\'s Art Commission about what constituted \'art\'. The museum claimed the statue was nothing more than a ""movie prop"", and didn\'t want it. Local people were outraged, and the statue was ultimately placed in front of the Wachovia Spectrum in South Philadelphia. It was later returned to the Art Museum for the filming of Rocky V (1990), after which it was again moved to the front of the Spectrum.', u'In his DVD commentary, Sylvester Stallone explains that some of Rocky\'s dialogue with Marie (Geraldine Hughes) was improvised on-set. For example, for the scene where he installs the light bulb, Stallone had no idea the bulb would be so bright, and his reaction to the glare is completely genuine. The line to Marie about meetings Steps\' father on a cruise ship was another improvised line, as was his observation that he\'s a better dancer then the average bear. Stallone was so surprised with himself for coming up with this comparison, that his next line, ""Where that came from, I don\'t know"", was also improvised.', u'The computer simulation fight was based on The Super Fight (1970) which pitted Muhammad Ali against Rocky Marciano. Every possible scenario was considered and filmed and the computer decided that Marciano would win in the 13th round. When told of the result, Ali retorted ""that computer was made in Alabama"".', u""Sylvester Stallone explains in Skill vs. Will: The Making of 'Rocky Balboa' (2007) that Milo Ventimiglia landed the role of Robert, Jr. in part because of the similarities between their mouths; if you look closely, you can see that Ventimiglia's mouth hooks down in much the same way as Stallone's does."", u'In earlier drafts of the screenplay, Rocky\'s former opponents Clubber Lang and Ivan Drago had cameo appearances. Clubber would have been a ringside commentator for the bout with Dixon and made disparaging remarks about Rocky. The scene with Drago had Rocky visiting him in a hospital where he is dying of AIDS from steroid abuse. Supposedly Rocky would have told a nurse, ""If he dies, he dies"" - the same line Drago said about Apollo Creed in the fourth movie. Both of these scenes were eventually removed from the script.', u""In the DVD commentary for his film First Blood (1982) Sylvester Stallone recalls an incident during filming where a girl in the town bar pretended to be a fan of his in order to try and wheedle a free round of drinks out of him. He later includes just such a scene in 'Rocky Balboa'."", u'According to Sylvester Stallone, Antonio Tarver held up filming of the fight scene and demanded a higher salary. He refused to start filming until he was guaranteed more money. Stallone gave up a large part of his own salary and paid it to Tarver.', u'The paintings made by Paulie in the film were done by Burt Young, an avid painter.', u'Adrian Balboa has a real grave in Philly.', u'According to an interview with Mark S. Driscoll of Look! Effects, one of the fight scenes uses backgrounds from an earlier fight which Sylvester Stallone actually attended prior to filming. He said it should be possible to see Stallone (as himself) in the audience while Stallone (as Rocky) is in the ring.', u""As he had done with the previous five films, writer Sylvester Stallone incorporated a great deal of biographical material into this film. As Stallone himself explains on the DVD commentary, to a certain extent, Mason Dixon is based on himself; a man who has made some bad decisions after taking advice from people who didn't really have his best interests at heart."", u'After the release of the film, critics hailed the fighting scenes as the most realistic in the entire Rocky saga. On the DVD, Sylvester Stallone hypothesizes that a major factor in this realism was that he used realistic sound-effects for punches. When a punch lands in the film, the sound used was a real punch, whereas in previous films, sounds used for punches had included shotgun blasts, broken bottles, chains and baseball bats hitting wet leather.', u'On the DVD commentary, Sylvester Stallone says he based the idea of Rocky owning a restaurant and spending his time telling old fight stories on former world heavyweight champion Jack Dempsey.', u""According to Sylvester Stallone, they put both endings (one with Dixon winning by decision, and one with Rocky winning by decision) on the DVD so that fans could choose how they want the character's saga to end."", u""Adrian Balboa was alive in the first few drafts of the script, while Robert Balboa was in the U.S. Air Force, then titled Rocky VI: Puncher's Chance. At this point, the story revolved around Rocky running a local gym for youths. However, Sylvester Stallone felt that the film lacked the necessary emotional impact it needed. So, he and Talia Shire came to an agreement that her character would be best left out of the film, as this would create an emotional chasm for Rocky from the very first moment of the film. To ensure that fans did not think she had been written out of the film because of a dispute with Stallone or because she refused to be in it, Shire made a public statement supporting Stallone's decision to kill off the character."", u'""Take You Back"", the song which opens the film, was first performed by Frank Stallone on a street corner in the original Rocky.', u'Andy (Don Sherman), the bartender from Rocky (1976), Rocky III (1982) and Rocky V (1990) can briefly be seen in this film sitting in a wheelchair in the background of his bar cheering on Rocky during the fight. Andy originally had a more sizable role, but the scene was cut from the finished film.', u""Although it is not included as a deleted scene on the DVD, Sylvester Stallone has said that a scene was filmed in which Rocky sees a woman that looks like Adrian in the building where Robert, Jr. works. He follows her for a while before he realizes it is not Adrian. Stallone decided to cut the scene because he felt that Rocky's loneliness had already been established enough, and that this scene was overkill."", u'Sylvester Stallone initially wanted Roy Jones, Jr. for the role of Mason Dixon. Stallone claims that he left 31 phone messages for Jones but never received a response.', u'Sylvester Stallone originally wanted to film Rambo (2008) before he could film Rocky Balboa (2006). However, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) gave him the green-light and Stallone had to put Rambo on hold.', u'In the fight between Dixon and Balboa, one of the commentators says, ""Balboa was hit so hard his ancestors must have felt it"" This is possibly a reference to the real fight between Muhammad Ali (then Cassius Clay) and Henry Cooper in 1963. In an interview with Ali after the fight, in which he was knocked down, Ali explained, ""He (Cooper) hit me so hard, my ancestors in Africa felt it.""', u'Assuming standard sized gym weights, during the ""Gonna Fly Now"" workout scene, Rocky was benching 365 pounds, snatch and lifting 315 pounds, and squatting 495 pounds.', u'Mike Tyson improvised his lines.', u""According to Jodi Letizia's lawyer, Sylvester Stallone had promised her that she would reprise her role as Marie in this film. When Letizia learned that that Geraldine Hughes had been cast in the role instead, she filed a lawsuit against Stallone, claiming that she had cleared her entire schedule to prepare for the filming. The lawsuit was eventually settled."", u'Sylvester Stallone trained for six months to get in shape for his role.', u'This is the only Rocky sequel not to contain a recap from its predecessor.', u'Antonio Tarver (the real light heavyweight champion at the time of production) trained for 5 weeks prior to the film and had to put on 25 pounds.', u'This film was shipped to theaters under the code name ""Nobody Parties"".', u'All of the arena material was filmed in HD to match the HBO PPV look; the rest of the film was shot on standard 35mm.', u""The championship belts used in the movie were actually those of Antonio Tarver, who played Mason 'The Line' Dixon.

Although the magazine only lasted four issues, Stallone included portions of his script for this movie, including illustrations of some scenes. The drawing of Mason Dixon does not resemble Antonio Tarver, as the part had not yet been cast."", u""In the end credits where everyone is reenacting Rocky's iconic run up the steps, Sylvester Stallone's wife, Jennifer Flavin, is shown doing it as well."", u'No traditional soundtrack was released for the film. Instead, a CD called ""Rocky Balboa - The Best of Rocky"" was released, featuring a collection of the best songs from the entire franchise. The release date of that compilation album (December 26, 2006) also coincided with the 30th anniversary re-release of the original soundtrack to Rocky (1976).', u'This was the first film that Sylvester Stallone directed since Rocky IV (1985).', u""The fight scene happened right after an actual boxing event, so people who were there for a pay-per-view match got to see the ending scene.

Antonio Tarver (the real-life boxer who plays Dixon) is also from Tampa.', u'The HBO broadcast team for the fight is Jim Lampley, Max Kellerman, and Larry Merchant. Normally, HBO does not use both Kellerman and Merchant on the same broadcast. It would not be until five years later that this trio actually worked a real boxing broadcast together.', u""While the dramatic portions of the movie are shot in an obviously cinematic style, the bout between Balboa and Dixon is shot in several different ways. The lead-in to the bout, as well as the first two rounds, are shot in a style similar to a major pay-per-view broadcast. Clips from fights in previous Rocky movies are used during the introductory teaser to introduce Balboa, while stock footage from actual Tarver fights, as well as footage from Dixon's previous fight (shown at the beginning of the film) are used as clips for Dixon's part of the teaser. The fight itself was shot in high definition to further enhance the television-style look of the fight."", u'According to the behind-the-scenes documentary on the DVD, there were slight continuity problems during the filming of the fight. This was said to have been due to the fact that real punches were thrown by both Sylvester Stallone and Antonio Tarver, resulting in some swelling and nosebleeds earlier than scripted. The DVD release features an alternate ending in which Rocky wins the fight (also by a split decision).', u""At one point in the movie, Rocky cracks a few eggs in a glass and drinks them. It's a nod to the original Rocky (1976) when Rocky does the same thing."", u'In one scene, Rocky mistakenly identifies ""Little"" Marie\'s son and comments that he has her ""big Irish hair"".

Sylvester Stallone purposely left this shot until the end because he knew it would be such an emotional experience due to the iconic nature of the scene, and he felt it was a good way for him to say goodbye to the character. As he puts it himself, ""that run is the distillation of the entire Rocky experience.""', u'Sylvester Stallone was actually knocked unconscious while filming the final fight scene.', u'Stallone\'s original cut of the film ran near 2 1/2 hours. This cut of the film played to sneak preview audiences on May 15th, 2006. This was before MGM demanded Stallone cut the film down to an hour and forty-five minutes (the release print eventually ran an hour and forty-two minutes). Scenes cut out that are not included on the DVD release include:    -After talking with his son, Rocky follows a woman up an escalator, thinking she\'s Adrian. When he gets to her, he discovers she, of course, isn\'t.    -There were many more visits to Adrian\'s grave in the original cut.    -Rocky\'s brain damage being shown to have not been brain damage at all was trimmed from the license scene.    -Two training sequences: one of Rocky doing weight training as well as Mason Dixon doing his training to the tune of Survivor\'s ""Fire Makes Steel"" and afterward was a Rocky-only training sequence scored with ""Gonna Fly Now"". These two sequences were squished together for the final print.    -Before the fight, Marie and Rocky share a hug.    -Rocky says hi to Mike Tyson before the fight.    -The film was also shot with four endings so as not to spoil the end to the watching crowd. They are: 1 - Rocky loses the fight by decision; 2 - Rocky loses the fight by K.O.; 3 - Rocky wins the fight by decision; 4 - Rocky wins the fight by K.O.', u'The only characters to appear in the first six Rocky films, in footage unique to each film, are Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone), Paulie (Burt Young), and Tony ""Duke"" Evers (Tony Burton). While Adrian (Talia Shire) appears in the five earlier films, she only appears here in flashbacks, the character having died prior to the film\'s events.

In Australia, Portugal, UK, the Netherlands, and other countries, the theme song is Let It Ride by Charlie Clouser, while in other countries, such as the U.S. and Canada, the theme song is A Little Less Conversation (the Junkie XL mix) by Elvis Presley. For the American DVD, as well as the episodes available for viewing on NBC\'s website, the Clouser song is used. Occasionally, there have been different opening songs for some episodes. For example, Las Vegas: Pharaoh \'Nuff (2007) opened with ""Crazy Bitch"" by Buckcherry.', u'The location of the fictional Montecito has changed from season to season. Some of the first episodes were taped at the Monte Carlo Resort and Casino, which is located at the intersection of Tropicana and the Vegas Strip (next to New York, New York, and across from the MGM Grand). (They closed down the strip on at least one occasion at that block to film a car scene.) Because of its similarity to Mandalay Bay, many of the show\'s visuals place the Montecito at the southern end of The Strip, albeit usually across the street from Mandalay Bay on the airport side of Las Vegas Boulevard. The exact location and rotation of the building, seems to vary a lot within this area, indeed, the CGI zoom shots of the building exterior in the season two episode, ""Montecito Lancers"", shows the building in three slightly differing locations for three different shots. Many of Mandalay Bay\'s interiors and exteriors (including its wave pool) have been used as Montecito exteriors, although the actual set of Montecito is located at Culver Studios, in Culver City, California, so the interiors are a replica of the Mandalay Bay. These studios are where Gone with the Wind (1939) was filmed. During the first season of the show, many of the Montecito\'s suites overlooked various parts of the middle part of the Strip, placing the hotel near where the Venetian, the Flamingo, or the Mirage are currently, before the more consistent location at the southern end of the Strip was finalized. In season three, Ed Deline\'s office appears to be in the middle of the strip, overlooking Harrah\'s, Caesar\'s Palace, the Mirage, and the Venetian, which puts the Montecito near where Treasure Island is located. This is inconsistent with the flyover shots of the Montecito, which would place Ed\'s office over two miles away. Closer examination of the window scene, shows that the Mirage\'s marquee over their driveway has been edited to read ""Montecito"". In season four, episode two (at around thirty-four minutes) there is a scene in Ed Deline\'s office, where again we can see an overview of The Mirage and Caesar\'s Palace. Again, it\'s a confirmation that Ed Deline\'s office would be where Treasure Island is located. According to an episode that originally aired in December 2005, the Montecito is located about 1.5 miles from the Wynn Las Vegas. It\'s possible that this distance is in a straight line, as opposed to actual driving distance. This distance is inconsistent with long shots, that place the Montecito near the airport and Mandalay Bay, but is in line with season three\'s visual references noted above. Other episodes show aerial shots of the Montecito, that make it appear to be situated at the corner of Giles Street and Reno Avenue, about half a mile from the Mandalay Bay. In the opening credits for the show\'s later seasons, the final clip ends at the front of the Montecito. On the DVD release, you can see the Mandalay Bay sign for a split second before the CGI switch to Montecito.', u'The casino, out of which Hiro Nakamura and Ando Masahashi are thrown out, in season one, episode four of Heroes (2006), is the Montecito.', u""In Heroes: Chapter Four 'Collision' (2006) and Heroes: Chapter Five 'Hiros' (2006), Hiro, Ando, Nathan, and Niki all stay at the Montecito.

A film is a very delicate creature. Any adverse publicity or internal shake-up can upset the perception of - and studio confidence in - a feature. For some unknown reason the original producer pulled out and right away the film was considered damaged goods; by the time we ended filming there was trouble brewing on the set because of overages and creative concerns between the director and the studio. The studio let it sit on the shelf for many months and after over a year it was decided to do a re-shoot. We screened it, it tested okay, Ron Howard was involved with overseeing some of the post-production... but the movie had the smell of death about it. Actually, if you looked up, you could see celluloid buzzards circling as we lay there dying on the distributor\'s floor.

The director and screenwriter, however, had intended a darker, more satirical approach, which led to many difficulties behind the scenes.', u'The scene in which Fergie mocks Dredd was improvised, and it turned out to be so funny to see Rob Schneider making fun of Sylvester Stallone, that it was kept in the movie.', u'In the Dredd comics, tradition dictates that Dredd does not take off his helmet, thus his face has mostly only fleetingly appeared in full, but the producers obviously would not allow an expensive performer, such as Sylvester Stallone, to never show his face clearly.', u'Sylvester Stallone had never heard of Judge Dredd until he was offered the role.', u'In an interview, Rob Schneider claimed that the film crew gave Sylvester Stallone extra fire retardant on the back of his costume for the fiery exhaust shaft scene, while Mr. Schneider got no fire retardant at all.', u'According to Rob Schneider, Sylvester Stallone called him and offered him the role of Fergie after first choice, Joe Pesci, turned it down.', u""Director Danny Cannon had to fight hard to convince the producers to make the film in England.

One of the main differences was that in the film, Judge Griffin is a scheming, cold-hearted villain who wants to turn Mega City One into an even more authoritarian society, in the comics, he was an honorable man who was head of the academy before becoming Chief Judge of Mega City One (the film calls this position ""Chief Justice"") and had personally trained Dredd and was a mentor to him.

Although the film does follow the comics, in that he is the DNA ""father"" of Dredd and Rico (who are cloned from him).', u'According to an interview with writer Steven E. de Souza for the Den Of Geek web site in December 2013, the original cut was rated NC-17 and had to be re-cut and resubmitted to the MPAA five times in order to get an R rating. This was before Sylvester Stallone and the studio tried to cut the movie even further to get PG-13 rating. For example, the scene where Rico kills news reporter Hammond and his wife was originally longer and it showed two of them getting hit by bullets in slow-mo. The scene where the ABC Warrior robot kills Judge Griffin by ripping his arms and legs off while Griffin screams was also deleted for these reasons. This scene was not to be shown onscreen but Danny Cannon wanted to make the movie more and more violent (just like original comic, which he was a fan of) despite the fact that the studio and Stallone wanted the movie to be PG-13 with more focus on humor. Probably the most infamous deleted sequence is one where Dredd fights and shoots clone Judges during the ending. This scene was deleted for unknown reasons and some promotional stills show parts of it, clones waking up and Dredd shooting one of them. There was also a magazine article about this deleted sequence. Some of the other parts of the movie got cut out as well by Stallone and studio.', u'In the novelization and the comic book adaptation of the film, Fergie dies, when he using his hacking skills to save Dredd and Hershey from the ABC Robot and Dredd apologizes to Fergie for misjudging him. In the film, after Fergie hacks into the ABC Robot and saves Hershey, Fergie lives and is seen being loaded into an ambulance and requests that they pull over by an ATM at the end of the movie.', u'Sylvester Stallone and Armand Assante also played brothers in Paradise Alley (1978).', u'Janus is a Roman god with two opposite faces.

In the movie, Spartan is shown protecting some girl during the shootout in sewers, this is his daughter and she is also seen later in the ending scene standing next to Friendly while he is talking with Spartan.Some violent scenes with Simon Phoenix were also cut down or removed completely, like for example, scene where he rips out warden Smithers eye and scene near the ending where he kills several people inside cryo prison with machine gun were originally shown onscreen and were more graphic, scene where he kills the guy from which he took the car after escaping from cryo prison was deleted, there was also a part during the final fight between him and Spartan where Spartan takes some loose wire and shocks him.Other deleted scenes include Phoenix killing Zachary Lamb after he escapes from sewers, and Spartan and Huxley find Lamb and talk to him before he dies (note that Phoenix has his gun out when he enters the cop car but he didn't in the previous shot) and before car chase starts. Many extra lines of dialogue were cut out but some can be heard in various trailers for the film, and longer/additional action scenes were also deleted.Both the sewer battle sequence and final showdown in cryo prison were very heavily cut down, which caused some continuity mistakes in the final film because there are six different cryo cons working with Simon, but only two are shown being defeated in the film when Spartan and Huxley arrive at Cocteau's building and fight with them as Lenina Huxley knocks out one cryo-con and shoots the other dead as he draws the knife. One of the six isn't known for sure as there could be a cut out scene as he's either killed or knocked out. Due to massive cuts made on these sequences, the death scenes of ones who got killed by Spartan and others in sewers and ones killed by him in cryo prison were also cut out. The original cryo prison action finale included scene where Spartan fights with and kills several more prisoners who were thawed out by Simon and who also injected them with megadrenalin to wake them up faster and make them tougher to defeat, and this was also where the infamous deleted fight scene between Sylvester Stallone and Jesse Ventura took place in which according to manly movie Sylvester Stallone and Jesse Ventura throw down and Sylvester Stallone defeats Jesse Ventura with a running tackle. It's clearly to assume 2 of the cryocons near the conclusion not seen anymore are eliminated when the cryo-prison was blown up following the death of Simon Phoenix.In the deleted action scene during the battle in sewers, Spartan goes on the bridge from which Phoenix and his gang are shooting from, and starts to fight with Phoenix but then the bridge turns over. While both of them are hanging on it, Phoenix says to Spartan that bus passengers which he failed to save back in 1996 were already dead, meaning that Spartan was sent to CryoPrison for nothing. In the movie, Phoenix says this to Spartan during the car chase near the end of the movie but Phoenix is not shown speaking onscreen which probably means that the dialogue from the deleted scene was placed in this scene or was dubbed by the actor.Some other deleted and alternate scenes can be seen in trailers, promotional photos and are also in the comic book adaptation and novelization of the movie."", u'The novelization reveals that Assistant Bob is a eunuch. Cocteau had him castrated to prevent him from becoming too ambitious.', u'The magnetic accelerator (possibly similar to a rail or coil gun) used by Wesley Snipes in the Museum Armory sequence is based on the Heckler and Koch G11, a prototype weapon for the German army that would have been the most advanced rifle in the world, firing caseless ammunition (bullets, not ferrous slugs).', u""Nigel Hawthorne, inexperienced in cinema, took his role to prove that he had screen presence for the producers of The Madness of King George (1994).

As it transpired, this was unnecessary, as Hawthorne was the producers' automatic choice for the lead."", u'The screenwriting process for the film became incredibly convoluted as far as both the number of writers involved and the changes between drafts along with the wildly divergent ideas different producers had. At one point, Peter M. Lenkov, Jonathan Lemkin and Craig Sheffer were all claiming credits and/or working on the film at the same time. The situation only cleared itself when Joel Silver took on chief production values; he paid all of the writers substantial amounts of money to go away, then used the work of Lemkin along with body-and-fender work from writer Daniel Waters (whom Silver had worked with on The Adventures of Ford Fairlane (1990)).', u'Denis Leary, a stand-up comic known for his rants put himself into Edgar Friendly, particularly in one scene, where Edgar rants on at Spartan about food, smoking cigars and reading Playboy magazines.', u'It was rumored there was going to be a sequel ""Demolition Man 2"" and it would take place after this film, which John Spartan and Lenina Huxley would have married and Jackie Chan would play the main antagonist, replacing Wesley Snipes, but the sequel did not happen.

Surprisingly enough, Carolco estimated that the budget for Gale Force would be around forty million dollars, and the final budget for this movie, turned out to be seventy million dollars.', u'Renny Harlin initially turned down the opportunity to direct, as he ""didn\'t want to make another Die Hard 2 (1990)"".', u'In the cave of bats scene, the ""bats"" seen on-screen, were added in post-production as a visual effect. Real bats were brought in to fill the cave, but Sylvester Stallone and Janine Turner were too afraid to shoot the scene with live bats.', u""The parachute that the base-jumper opens, on his escape from the villains, features the design of the Finnish flag, Renny Harlin's native country (he features the Finnish flag in most of his movies)."", u'TriStar Pictures and Carolco Pictures planned a sequel in 1994, called ""The Dam"", which was described as ""Die Hard in a dam"", and would have Sylvester Stallone\'s character from this movie fighting terrorists, who took over Hoover Dam, but it never went beyond the developmental stage. Stallone tried to resurrect the project again in 2008, but it never happened.', u'The Denver Mint, featured in the film as the producer of the cash stolen by Qualen and his associates, actually only produces coins. One hundred million dollars from the Denver Mint would weigh two thousand five hundred tons.', u'After Michael France sold the ""Cliffhanger"" script to Carolco Pictures for five hundred thousand dollars, the company was visited by two independent producers, Gene Patrick Hines and James R. Zatolokin, who provided proof that France was not the originator of the story. It turned out the idea had been first developed in the 1980s by Hines and a world-famous climber and author John Long. Carolco agreed to pay Hines and Zatolokin a producers\' fee of four hundred thousand dollars, and gave them co-producing credit. John Long received a ""Based on a premise by..."" credit.', u""Thirty-one well-known climbers were signed up, including Ron Kauk and Wolfgang G\xfcllich.

He had a net on the set for practice. The models he was dating complained about his rough hands.', u'Sylvester Stallone played Rambo, in the film franchise of the same name. In the novelization of this film, Stallone\'s character is referred to as ""Rambo on ice"".', u""One of the buckles on the horse's bridle is a piece of climbing equipment."", u""The film has been criticized for its unrealistic portrayal of rock climbing. One example is the feature of the bolt-gun which fires bolts directly into rock, forgoing the usual rock-drilling and bolt-hammering used in rock-climbing. This ignores certain material properties of rock that should cause the bolt-gun's impact site to shatter and explode with flaky projectiles. The bolt gun is considered the most serious of the film's technical inaccuracies. Further examples are showing athletic moves, which have no use in real climbing, or free soloing with, then also completely useless gear."", u""Renny Harlin's first choice to play Qualen, was David Bowie."", u'Roxy Music lead singer Bryan Ferry was briefly considered for the role of Qualen.', u'The March 30, 1992 shooting draft, also lists Terry Hayes as one of the Screenwriters.', u'Dana Delany was offered the role of Jessie Deighan.', u'During the fight scene in the cave, Kynette (Leon) pulls out a very long knife with a serrated back edge reminiscent of the style made famous by Rambo. Sylvester Stallone played Rambo.', u'Rex Linn (Travers) appeared in episodes of 3rd Rock from the Sun (1996) and Northern Exposure (1990), which starred his co-stars in this movie, John Lithgow (Qualen) and Janine Turner (Jessie), respectively.', u'A big blooper. In one scene he is in the water under a sheet of ice. Then a little while later he is bone dry. Also, other rescue people are wearing jackets.

In order to get it to slide off, Renny Harlin had her wear a glove that was a couple of sizes too big, and filled the glove with Vaseline, and even then Sylvester Stallone's grip was too tight, and the glove almost stayed on."", u'Body count: seventeen.']","[u'France::20 May 1993 (Cannes Film Festival)', u'USA::26 May 1993 (Hollywood, California)\n (premiere)', u'USA::28 May 1993', u'South Korea::12 June 1993', u'Netherlands::24 June 1993', u'UK::25 June 1993', u'Ireland::25 June 1993', u'Denmark::2 July 1993', u'Finland::2 July 1993', u'New Zealand::2 July 1993\n (premiere)', u'Sweden::2 July 1993', u'Australia::8 July 1993', u'Hungary::16 July 1993', u'Argentina::22 July 1993', u'Germany::29 July 1993', u'Philippines::12 August 1993', u'Portugal::3 September 1993', u'Uruguay::10 September 1993', u'Brazil::17 September 1993', u'Spain::17 September 1993', u'France::6 October 1993', u'Italy::29 October 1993', u'Czech Republic::26 November 1993', u'Japan::4 December 1993', u'Turkey::January 1994', u'Greece::26 April 2000 (DVD premiere)']",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

He told Poster he wanted the film to look more like Rocky (1976), which had been lit by James Crabe, oftentimes using a single spotlight to light an entire scene (such as the opening boxing match).

So we hire Jeb Stuart, who was then one of the hottest writers in Hollywood, to rewrite the script and we go off looking for prison locations. Now we have a star, a theme, a shooting date, a budget, a studio, but we still have no script. So we all go back to New York City, and move into a hotel where Larry \'tortures\' Jeb and Henry Rosenbaum into writing a script in record time. Meanwhile, I\'m going around scouting prisons. We finally found one in Rahway, New Jersey. Jeb and Henry were writing the script as we were making the movie. New pages would come in every day. There was one day when I was on the third tier of a cell-block in Rahway Penitentiary and I had nothing to shoot. I had my movie star, all these extras and a great location - and the pages were on their way. So we sat around and bullshitted with the prisoners. Stallone is a smart guy and a very underrated actor.

MacDonald felt that this turn of events had hurt the movie's box office returns, because the idea of the Russians being the primary villains in this movie was no longer really believable. At the same time though, MacDonald was somewhat glad of the idea that the events of this movie may have helped to contribute to Russia's withdrawal from Afghanistan."", u""Although it has been claimed that the film was banned in parts of the UK after the killing spree of Michael Ryan, and that he was inspired by the Rambo movies, neither was in fact the case. A scheduled screening of the original First Blood (1982) was pulled from UK television (as was a screening of Nevada Smith (1966)), leading the UK's 'Daily Mail' and other media outlets to assume a direct link that never existed and which quickly became a popular urban legend. The film was heavily cut by the BBFC (by 1min 25secs for theatrical release and 3mins 3secs for home video), primarily for knife violence and cruelty to animals, but never banned. The DVD release has all the cuts reinstated apart from a two second shot of animal cruelty, in this case it being a horsefall."", u'The problems that the Russian forces faced with American Stinger missiles supplied to the mujaheddin fighters, as described in this movie, were very real, and accounted for the downing and destruction of hundreds of Russian helicopters during the real war.

Trautman understands and says goodbye to Rambo and wishes him luck and returns home to America alone."", u""Some footage filmed by original director Russell Mulcahy is present in the final cut. The scenes are; the sequence in which Trautman is ambushed by the helicopter and captured, as well as the scene of Rambo sitting on the roof off the temple pondering Trautman's proposition."", u""The Mi-24 Hind-A (large glazed cockpit as opposed to two small tandem cockpits for the later D version onwards of the type) helicopters seen in the film are in fact modified Aerospatiale SA 330 Puma transport helicopters with fabricated bolt-on wings similar to the real Hind-A's used in the former Soviet bloc nations."", u'When Sylvester Stallone ranked his preference of the Rambo films on the UK chat show Graham Norton, he ranked this one 3rd.', u'During filming, Sylvester Stallone had a close call with a spinning helicopter rotor blade.

Cobra attempts to shoot Nightstalker but is jumped by Stalk, only to be accidentally shot by Nightslasher.

Even though everything was prepared to start filming the scene at night, Sylvester Stallone ordered for the ending to be changed and to happen during the day because of the mosquito problem at that time which would have made night-time filming very difficult to endure.', u'In 2017, Sylvester Stallone used his Instagram page to post a picture of Cobretti standing next to the 1950 Mercury car with the caption, ""Comeback or throwback?"" Thousands of fans used this as the opportunity to lobby Stallone for a sequel or director\'s cut Blu-ray of the film.', u'The submachine gun used by Marion Cobretti in the final showdown with biker gang is a Jati-Matic.

The gun is chambered in 9x19 parabellum, has a cyclic rate of 600 rounds per minute, and has various accessories that were offered, such as a silencer, various capacity magazines, and a laser pointing device.', u'Cobretti uses a custom Colt Gold Cup National Match 1911 in 9mm using Glaser Safety Slugs, a frangible bullet. This is shown when he unloads his pistol in his apartment to clean it. The Colt Gold Cup National Match 1911 is usually chambered in .45 caliber ACP. The 9mm versions were made especially for the film.', u'Sylvester Stallone was a fan of John Cafferty and The Beaver Brown Band and approached them about doing a song for the film. The song ""Voice of America\'s Sons"" was written for the film, and John Cafferty had contributed to the Rocky IV soundtrack as well.', u'Andrew Robinson and Reni Santoni also appeared in Dirty Harry (1971). In both films, Santoni plays a police officer named Gonzales, while in the earlier film Robinson (credited as Andy Robinson) played the main antagonist.', u'The official soundtrack release includes a track called ""Skyline"" which is not heard anywhere in the movie. This is because scenes in which this track was used were cut out from the movie during re-editing. Originally there was a scene in which Cobretti is sitting in his home, looking at a sunset (there is a similar scene in the beginning of theatrical version in which he is cleaning up his gun and then looks at streets outside of his house) and soon, right after Nightslasher and his gang members killed the second victim and cops show up at the scene, Cobretti gets the call from his police chief or somebody else to go and meet with them and it is in this scene where the ""Skyline"" track is heard. ""Skyline"" was also originally used in some other scenes including the ending but from some reason it was removed and replaced with the song ""Voice Of America\'s Sons"" by John Cafferty.', u'In the diner scene where Cobretti brings over the fake hamburger to Ingrid, there is an oval frame on the wall that says ""King Cobra"" - a brand of beer.', u""Much of Nightslasher's attack on Ingrid in the hospital scene was cut for pacing and content. The deaths of the janitor and nurse were originally shown onscreen, and Nightslasher was also meant to kill the police officer guarding Ingrid. Two later scenes - Cobretti and Gonzales taking Ingrid out of the hospital, and Cobretti talking with Monte - originally included mentions of the officer's death. These were cut to avoid continuity errors, but as a result the editing in both scenes is choppy."", u'Santiago Segura has claimed that this movie was the inspiration for his well-known character Jose Luis Torrente, main star of Torrente - lain tyhm\xe4 k\xe4si (1998) and sequels, that he conceived as a parody of the 80s action movies. In fact, the title is a spoof of Stallone\'s movie, since then in Spain Cobra was titled as ""Cobra, el brazo fuerte de la ley"" (Cobra, the strong arm of the law).', u'Sylvester Stallone said he got the idea for the LAPD\'s ""Zombie Squad"" from a real-life Zombie Squad in Belgium, comprised of cops who go out at night and handle crazed criminals on their own terms.', u""In the original rough cut the car chase scene between Cobra and Nightslasher was longer and ended differently. While in the theatrical version Nightslasher shoots at Cobra's car and causes him to crash into the boat, in the original version Nightslasher and his driver crash into the boat first, and Cobra fails to stop his car and crashes into them. The shot of Nightslasher's car and him sighing in relief was re-purposed from an earlier part of the chase and the shot of Cobra seeing the boat before he crashes into it was actually taken from Nightslasher's car crash. However if you watch the theatrical version of this scene closely you can still see Nightslasher's crashed car right when Cobra's car crashes into the boat."", u'Al Leong was initially cast as one of the lead villains. His role was eliminated following protests by an advocacy group that objected to the casting of an Asian villain.', u""The movie is filled with over-the-top 1980s product placement. 1. Pepsi machine and Coors display and can in first shoot-out. 2. Giant Pepsi sign beside Stallone's apartment. 3. Toys R Us commercial which Stallone watches on television. 4. Pepsi sign lit up at night outside Stallone's apartment - background for fight scene. 5. Coors California sign in store window. 6. Coca-Cola machine outside store with character drinking can of Coke. 7. Bar scene with Miller High-Life sign in background."", u'The bobble-head doll that Cobra is playing with outside the diner is wearing the uniform of the Philadelphia Phillies.', u'In an interview Sylvester Stallone described the character of Marion Cobretti as ""Bruce Springsteen with a badge.""', u'In the first draft of the script by Sylvester Stallone, the opening sequence took place at a movie theater, not a supermarket.', u""Incorrectly regarded as a goof: When Cabretti spins his pistol cowboy-style in the supermarket, it's incorrectly regarded as a goof that the semi-automatic would have fired when twirled. The Colt National Match pistol he carried has a grip safety that prevents the trigger being pulled unless gripped properly. Regardless, it's unwise and irresponsible to play with firearms.""]","[u'Poland::1986', u'USA::23 May 1986', u'Netherlands::10 July 1986', u'Taiwan::19 July 1986', u'Australia::24 July 1986', u'Colombia::24 July 1986', u'UK::1 August 1986', u'Ireland::1 August 1986', u'Spain::8 August 1986 (Madrid)', u'Japan::9 August 1986', u'Brazil::11 August 1986', u'Denmark::15 August 1986', u'Uruguay::21 August 1986', u'Finland::12 September 1986', u'Argentina::25 September 1986', u'West Germany::2 October 1986', u'Portugal::17 October 1986', u'France::22 October 1986', u'Greece::22 October 1986', u'Italy::24 October 1986', u'South Korea::20 June 1987', u'Hungary::28 January 1988', u'Sweden::13 May 1988', u'Turkey::6 July 1990', u'Belgium::5 March 2015 (Offscreen Film Festival)']",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Lundgren threw Weathers across the ring before it was broken up.', u""When shooting the film, Sylvester Stallone decided that for the shooting of the fight, he and Dolph Lundgren should hit one another for real, so as to increase the intensity of the scene. After doing three takes of Rocky taking shots to ribs, Stallone felt a burning in his chest, but ignored it. Later that night, he had difficulty breathing and was taken to a nearby emergency room. It was discovered that his blood pressure was over 200, and he had to be flown on a low-altitude flight from Canada to St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica, where he remained in intensive care for four days. What had happened was that Lungren had punched him so hard in the chest, Stallone's heart had slammed up against his breastbone and began to swell, cutting off the blood supply and restricting the oxygen flow throughout the body."", u'Carl Weathers nearly quit the film when Dolph Lundgren tossed Weathers into the corner of the boxing ring. Weathers shouted profanities at Lundgren while leaving the ring and announcing that he was calling his agent and quitting the movie. Only after Sylvester Stallone forced the two actors to reconcile did the movie continue. This event caused a four-day work stoppage while Weathers was talked back into the part and Lundgren agreed to tone down his aggressiveness.', u""If you look carefully at the very opening scene (the American glove and the Russian glove colliding), you can see that a split second after the gloves collide and a split second before they're covered by the explosion, the Russian glove breaks in half and falls to the ground."", u'Over 8,000 people auditioned for the part of Ivan Drago.', u'According to Sylvester Stallone, Ivan Drago returned home in disgrace and became addicted to alcohol and steroids before committing suicide.', u'During a practice round, Sylvester Stallone told Dolph Lundgren to ""really go at it"" like how normal boxers do for 15 seconds. He ended up with a swelling pericardia sac around his heart and had to be rushed to the emergency room by plane. His insurance company thought he was faking it, saying that his injuries looked more ""from head-on collisions when the steering wheels hit you in the chest"". Stallone replied, ""Have you seen Dolph Lundgren?! That\'s a truck! That\'s a steering wheel! That\'s a head-on collision!"" His insurance company honored the claim soon after that.', u'Rocky IV was the highest grossing film in the Rocky series, taking in just over 300 million dollars worldwide.', u'It took Dolph Lundgren about six months to win the part and was first turned down by the casting directors for being too tall. Later, he got the chance to send photos and meet Sylvester Stallone who told him he had a good chance to get the part, but advised him to gain twenty pounds of muscle.', u'The ""hit the one in the middle"" exchange, long part of boxing lore, actually did happen during the Max Baer-Max Schmeling heavyweight fight in June 1933. Baer was knocked groggy by a Schmeling right hand in the first round and told his corner, ""I see three of him out there."" Ex-champ Jack Dempsey, who was in Baer\'s corner for the fight, responded with the famous line, and Baer went on to score a tenth-round knockout.', u'In the Italian dub of the movie, Ivan Drago\'s line ""I must break you"", was translated as ""I break you in two"" (""Ti spiezzo in due"", complete with fake Russian accent). It became by far the most famous quote from the movie in Italy, and it entered into common language as a much used slang phrase.', u'In reality, Soviet Heavyweights were not allowed to box professional fighters during the Cold War.', u'After realizing how Rocky\'s previous opponents (Apollo Creed and Clubber Lang) had loud and animated personalities, Dolph Lundgren came up with the ideas of making his character, Ivan Drago, very stoic, not move too much and just ""be there with an intimidating presence"". Sylvester Stallone incorporated these ideas by not giving the character too much dialogue and making big close ups, especially in the eyes.', u'Tony Burton, who has a brief scene in this film playing chess against a Russian opponent, is an accomplished chess player in real life, having once defeated master chessman and director Stanley Kubrick on the set of The Shining (1980).', u'Assuming they are standard weight lifting plates, Ivan Drago is pressing (standing press) 455 pounds.', u'The training scenes set in Russia were actually filmed in Wyoming.

However, he noted the damage both boxers sustained in the fight made them ""incapable of reason"" and thus instead planned Rocky V (1990) as a showcase of the dangers of boxing.', u'This was the last film that Sylvester Stallone directed until Rocky Balboa (2006).', u'The film is recognized as being ahead of its time in its demonstration of ground-breaking high-tech sporting equipment, some of which was experimental and twenty years from public use.', u'At 91 minutes, this the shortest of all the films in the Rocky series.', u""Numerous fans have stated that they find this film to be confusing in terms of the title belt, and what exactly happens to it when Rocky is in Russia. This is most likely because the scene explaining what would happen to the belt was cut from the film, and replaced with a newspaper montage. Initially, between Apollo's funeral and the Rocky/Drago press conference, there was to be a scene in which Rocky visits the U.S. boxing board. While there, he is told that they will not sanction the fight, and if he goes ahead with it, he will not be allowed to carry the title. This scene was cut prior to release as it was felt it would slow up the film too much, and it was replaced with the much briefer newspaper montage."", u""This is the first film in which Gonna Fly Now is not sung, although a few bars of the song are incorporated into Vince DiCola's score.

The goal was to create a knife that could be reliable for extreme survival situations, including being long and sharp enough to slice food or cut wood; waterproof and able to hold necessities like matches and medicine; able to carry a nylon string for fishing or snaring; and have an alternate blade of sawteeth for defense and in order to cut poles for shelter. In all, six knives were created to be used during production, with additional updated versions made for subsequent movies in the series.', u'After Kirk Douglas pulled out due to script differences at the last minute after being cast as Colonel Trautman, the producers rushed to replace him.

It is also identical in pronunciation to the Japanese title of the film.', u'Shortly after the novel was published in 1972, Columbia Pictures bought the filming rights at the behest of producer Lawrence Turman for a reported 75,000 dollars. Richard Brooks was originally attached to direct. Brooks spent a year on the project, researching it and writing a never completed 115 page script, which was to place more emphasis on the character of the Sheriff, and end with an unarmed Rambo being killed. Brooks did not have an actor in mind for Rambo but wanted Lee Marvin, or Burt Lancaster, to play the Sheriff, and Bette Davis to play a psychiatrist who deals with Rambo. However, Brooks was not happy with the script and did not want to make the film when Columbia wanted to, and the project fell apart.', u'David Morrell said that the novel and character Rambo is a distillation of the symptoms of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, and the signs of challenge of authority exhibited by university students who are younger than him. The novel is also a result of several discussion sessions organized by him after lectures aimed at the select group of students who have returned from a tour of duty in Vietnam.', u'After the success of Convoy (1978), Kris Kristofferson was considered as a possible choice for John Rambo.

Clint Eastwood and Robert De Niro were discussed for the lead and Martin Ritt agreed to direct from a script by Walter Newman, who did three drafts.

However Milius' producer, Buzz Feitshans eventually produced the movie after the original producer, Ed Carlin, died of a heart attack."", u'There are two possible alternate endings thought of or considered by Michael Kozoll, William Sackheim and Sylvester Stallone. The first would had seen Colonel Trautman forced to shoot and kill Rambo, just as Rambo is about to shoot the injured Teasle and kill him.

Also Rambo barely remembers Tratuman and is not friends with him."", u""Jeff Bridges, Robert De Niro, Michael Douglas, Paul Newman, Nick Nolte, Ryan O'Neal, and John Travolta were all considered for Rambo."", u""In 1975, Martin Bregman became attached and developed the project as a vehicle for Al Pacino. David Rabe was hired to write a script. However Pacino declined to make it. Rabe's script then briefly attracted the attention of Mike Nichols and for a time Ray Stark and Martin Ritt were interested."", u""Director Bruce Beresford was offered the script to direct but refused as he felt, at the time, that he wasn't suited to directing an action film."", u'Sylvester Stallone did an estimated seven revisions of the script. Ted Kotcheff requested further work be done on the script. This was performed by Larry Gross and David Giler.', u'In 1977, producer William Sackheim became involved and wrote a script with Michael Kozoll. Sackheim wanted to make the film with director John Badham starring John Travolta as Rambo, George C. Scott as Trautman and Gene Hackman or Charles Durning as the Sheriff. Sackheim spent eight months on the project but could not get finance.', u'Ted Kotcheff had been approached with the project in 1976. He only returned to work on it after Mario Kassar and Andrew G. Vajna offered to finance one of his projects. Kotcheff offered the role of John Rambo to Sylvester Stallone, and the actor accepted after reading the script through a weekend.', u""The FIELDS Department Store shown in the movie is actually a British Columbia chain, at that time owned by Zellers, which was part of HBC (Hudson's Bay Company)."", u'This was the thirteenth highest grossing film of 1982.', u""Currently, television rights to this film are owned by Paramount Pictures, which acquired Spelling Entertainment, the previous television right-holders, in 1999. The prints of the film that air on Spike, however, open with the Paramount logo variant that has the Paramount Communications (formerly Gulf+Western) byline, despite the fact that Paramount didn't get television rights to the film until years after the studio was sold to Viacom (the Paramount/Viacom merger completed in 1994, while the Spelling/Viacom merger completed in 1999)."", u""Three military decorations are seen behind sheriff Teasle's chair in his office, showing him being a Korean war veteran. It's the only visible sign of that fact, which in the book is an important plot factor."", u""The first name John was given to Sylvester Stallone's character for the movie. In David Morrell's novel the character is known only as Rambo. Also the iconic knife that Rambo carries is not mentioned in the novel."", u'The film was remade as In a Valley of Violence (2016).', u'The name of the sporting goods shop that Rambo blows up is ""The Outpost"".', u'Teasle arrests Rambo for vagrancy. The definition for vagrancy means, ""The state of living as a vagrant; homelessness"". A vagrant is a person who wanders from place to place.', u""In the movie, Will Teasle is a Sheriff.

He admitted that he had served in the US Marines in the 1960s but finished his tour of service before regular US forces were deployed to Vietnam.', u""Only Rambo film in which John Rambo doesn't use a bow and arrow."", u""The end of the chase between Rambo (on a motorcycle) and Sheriff Teasle, where Teasle's police car rolls off an embankment and flips over upside down, was not scripted this way, but when the car ended up in that position, Ted Kotcheff liked the result so much that he continued shooting the scene and had Brian Dennehy get into the police car while it was still upside down, and filmed the scene as it appears in the movie."", u'Sylvester Stallone suffered several serious injuries during filming of this movie. For the scene where Rambo jumps off the cliff and injures himself on some tree branches on the way down, Stallone performs the stunt himself during the bottom third of the fall, and in the process, broke one of his ribs when he landed on the tree branch. Stallone remarks on the DVD commentary that it was easy to play the landing when Rambo screams in pain, since he was not acting and was really in pain. Also for the scene where Rambo first runs into the abandoned mine shaft to elude the guardsmen firing at him, Stallone places his hand on top of a piece of wood, not realizing that his hand was right on top of a gunfire squib that went off a second later, injuring his hand in the process. Stallone mentions that the pain he felt was so intense, he was afraid to look at his hand, fearing the squib had completely blown his thumb off.', u'This film has a reputation of being overly violent. However, the total body count of the movie is one: Galt falling from the helicopter. All others survive, even Teasle.', u'In the script Rambo originally kills 18 people. While Ted Kotcheff described the killings as target practice, co-producer Andrew G. Vajna felt it was glorifying a crazed mass murderer thus suggested that Rambo should instead be a sympathetic person who is really lost without direction and a victim of circumstances. Thus in the final film, he was never seen killing a person directly.', u""In his commentary, author David Morell cites the inspiration for John Rambo as being World War II hero, and later Hollywood actor Audie Murphy. In Rambo (2008), the latest film of the series, the character's last stand in the finale is very similar to how Murphy was awarded the Medal of Honor, manning a vehicle mounted .50 calibre machine gun, and singlehandedly holding off hundreds of enemy soldiers."", u'Numerous sound bites of this film were lifted and used in the 1989 arcade version of Golden Axe (1989). The two most notable sounds used were that of Deputy Sergeant Galt, as he falls to his death from a helicopter, and that of Mitch, after he is stabbed by Rambo in the leg in order to draw the other officers to his aid.', u'In the book, Trautman was brought in to kill Rambo because he had trained him. Thus, he was the only one who could stop him.', u'Kirk Douglas was originally cast to play Colonel Samuel Trautman. Because of script issues (Kirk wanted Rambo to die at the end, as in the novel), he dropped out of the film and Richard Crenna was cast at the last second.', u'In the novel, Rambo kills Deputy Sergeant Art Galt by slicing his stomach open with the shaving razor, and dies from disembowelment. In the film, Galt is killed when he falls out of the helicopter, shortly after he deliberately unbuckles his safety belt.', u""In Rambo: The Video Game (2014). The player, as John Rambo, can kill the Sheriff's Deputies, The National Guardsmen, and other policemen. In this film, Rambo does not kill anymore, besides Galt which was accidental. In the novel, Rambo kills the cops and the National Guardsmen."", u'The 1983 broadcast of the film in Canada featured scenes that were cut from the theatrical version, and the following deleted scenes were not on the special features on the DVD and Blu-ray releases: Rambo checking the bullets in Galt\'s pistols. Balford saying ""I am ready when you are"". Lester consoling Galt\'s widow. Kern confronting Teasle on arresting Rambo. ""That boy is a heart attack!"". Additional dialogue between Teasle, Kern and Trautman. Extra footage of Rambo in the caves and Teasle offering to drive Trautman to the airport.', u""In the final scene when Rambo has an emotional breakdown with Col. Trautman, the story he tells Trautman about his friend and fellow Baker teammate Danforth (involving the '58 Chevy Convertible and the wired shoe box that blows up, mortally wounding him) was actually a true story told to Sylvester Stallone by a Vietnam War veteran who had had a similar traumatizing experience during the war."", u""The film is not as violent as the book. In the film, Rambo does not kill anymore - he wounds Teasle's Deputies and puts them out of action. Only one man is killed - Deputy Sergeant Art Galt. Galt is accidentally killed when he falls out of the helicopter, due to his own stupidity, because he removed his safety belt."", u""Some minor details are altered and/or changed or omitted. Some examples include: in the novel, Teasle was a Marine Corps veteran of the Korean War, whereas in the movie (indicated by his medals) he is a U.S. Army veteran of the Korean War. In the novel, Deputy Galt is a young rookie officer, clumsy and inexperienced. He is killed by Rambo purposefully (in the film, he's accidentally killed when the helicopter jerks and he falls). In addition, he's also an older officer with experience, albeit with a brutal streak in stark contrast to the clumsy Galt which appears in the novel. The beginning of the novel finds John Rambo attempting to hitch a ride from a gas station, as opposed to the film where he's searching for an old Army buddy. A subplot involving Teasle attempting to get in touch with his estranged wife is absent from the film, but present in the novel. The animal Rambo has for dinner is an owl in the novel, but a wild boar in the film. In the novel, Rambo has been said to have fought with his father and been drafted to fight in the Vietnam War; the film makes no mention of this, but Rambo does mention having a father and quite possibly going home to see him in Rambo (2008). The novel also has a slightly different ending: in the novel, both Rambo and Teasle die. Rambo is put out of his misery by Colonel Trautman and Teasle dies of injuries inflicted on him by Rambo. The movie ending finds Rambo surrendering after suffering a breakdown and Teasle being wheeled away to a hospital after being shot numerous times by Rambo (his fate is left ambiguous). Teasle's background is explored more in the novel, including him and Orval being old friends and Teasle being present at the battle of the Chosin Reservoir."", u""Spoiler for both the Film and the Novel) When Sheriff Teasle and Col. Trautman chat in the bar, Teasle asks Trautman what he would have done had he had confronted Rambo face-to-face: Hug him or blow his brains out. As it turns out, he does both depending on the ending for the film or for the novel. In the film's ending, Rambo has an emotional breakdown and Trautman hugs him in consolation. In the novel's ending, Trautman shoots Rambo with a shotgun, killing him."", u'The helicopter pilot does not tell Teasle or Trautman about Galt trying to kill him, and that Galt threatened to kill him, and that Rambo did not kill Galt.', u""Body count;- 1.  Galt, who plunges to his death from a helicopter as he's trying to shoot Rambo dead.

In all, she collected more than 10,000 and presented them to City Council. Stallone was grateful.

Despite all the personal drama and all the difficulties on the set, Hauer stated in his autobiography that he was happy he stayed aboard, as this movie caused him to be noticed in Hollywood, and started an impressive international career.', u'Prior to its theatrical release, Nighthawks (1981) was severely cut for violence by both the MPAA and the Universal Pictures studio. Amongst the scenes that were cut are the disco shootout which originally had Wufgar shooting and killing more people, and Wufgar\'s death scene in the ending which was almost completely cut out. An original uncut scene showed Wufgar getting shot five times (instead of twice) in slow-motion by DaSilva, and in the end, the final sixth shot hit him in the head blowing his brains out. An animatronic head of Rutger Hauer was made by special makeup artist Dick Smith and used in this scene. Although there never was an uncut version available, the soundtrack release for the movie included a track called ""Face to Face"" which was used in the uncut ending.', u'The first scene that Rutger Hauer had to film was his death scene that happens in ending of the film. While filming the scene, Hauer was injured twice. In one instance a squib meant to simulate a gunshot wound exploded on the wrong side and severely burned him. In the other, a cable that would yank him to simulate the force of being shot was pulled too hard, straining his back. Afterward, Hauer discovered that the cable was pulled with such force on Sylvester Stallone\'s orders. This was the last straw for Hauer, who then threatened Stallone that he would ""break his balls"" if he ever does something like that again; their working relationship afterward was marked by numerous arguments.  Stallone felt that Hauer\'s performance dominated the film. Two versions of the film were shown to test audiences, one with more emphasis on Stallone\'s character and the other on Hauer\'s. The version featuring more of Hauer\'s scenes was better received by audiences. Stallone then removed some of Hauer\'s scenes from what became the final version of the film. This has also been confirmed in Frank Sanello\'s book ""Stallone: A Rocky Life"".', u""When the original director, Gary Nelson, left the project, Bruce Malmuth took over production. When he couldn't make it on his first day to shoot the train chase, Sylvester Stallone directed the chase himself to not miss a day of shooting. This caused trouble with the Director's Guild. Guild rules state that a Director's Guild member cannot be fired so an actor can take over directing a film he is starring in, so the producers asked for and received special permission for Stallone to direct the scene."", u""Among the scenes which were deleted from the original cut of the movie are almost all scenes between Sylvester Stallone and Lindsay Wagner, 'Rutger Hauer' and Persis Khambatta, more scenes explaining the plot better, and many other scenes because Universal wanted a fast-paced action movie. They also cut most of the graphic and gory scenes due to the concern that the movie will get X rating. And indeed, even though it was already cut for violence by the studio, Nighthawks (1981) still got an X rating when it was submitted to the MPAA and it again had to be heavily cut for R rating. Stallone also had a hand in reediting of the movie. He was jealous of Hauer whose performance dominated the movie, so during filming he wrote and added more scenes for his character, and later he also cut some of Hauer's scenes from the movie."", u""The story was originally planned as The French Connection III by screenwriter David Shaber at 20th Century Fox, and would have seen Gene Hackman's Popeye Doyle team up with a wisecracking cop, to be possibly played by Richard Pryor.

Most of the tracks from the soundtrack are longer than their movie versions, and there are some which were intended for some longer scenes, ones of many which were deleted. Best example of it is the track ""Face to Face"" which is the music that Emerson composed for the infamous original ending where Wulfgar is torn to pieces in slow motion with his flesh and blood flying around the room while Deke shoots at him. Emerson said some interesting things in the soundtrack notes about composing the music for deleted scenes between Deke and Irene (in notes he refers to character DaSilva as De Soto); ""That bit when De Soto tries to get back with his ex-wife (Lindsay Wagner) we need some love interest there"", said Harry. ""I made notes (Humm, love interest). Sly, whom I felt comfortable addressing as such, felt uncomfortable watching the rushes. His comments upon viewing the love scenes between Lindsay and himself led him to say, \'That\'s the last time I go in Billy Dee\'s trailer.\' Most of it was cut along with the love interest music.""Emerson also said some things about his music being edited for the final theatrical version of the movie; ""Universal got some old dyke as music editor that had worked on Jaws (1975). She was a minimalist in maximalist clothing and immediately set about stripping everything down apart from my underwear in order for my entire score to reach the big screen as half the man I might have been.

For the scene where his character jumps onto a moving subway train and kicks out the window the glass was wire-reinforced and would take a good kick. Stallone insisted on using the real glass all the same. But when he braced and kicked the glass, it fell out at a touch, throwing him off balance and almost off the train. Due to a lifelong fear of heights, Stallone said of the helicopter stunt, ""I\'ve never been so scared in my life"".

In reality, Stallone experienced a similar sense of being quickly forgotten after his two post-Rocky (1976) movies, Paradise Alley (1978) (Stallone's directorial debut) and F.I.S.T.

The plots would have consisted of Rocky going into politics, running for Mayor of Philadelphia on the Reform Ticket, and winning. Only to have be scandalized, when Paulie is caught stealing from the treasury.

The comment about Rocky's robe being too baggy came about the same way - the robe delivered to the set was far too baggy for Stallone, so rather than hope people wouldn't notice, the character himself simply points it out."", u""Most of the scenes of Rocky jogging through Philadelphia were shot guerrilla-style, with no permits, no equipment and no extras. The shot where he runs past the moored boat for example; the crew were simply driving by the docks and John G. Avildsen saw the boat and thought it would make a good visual, so he had Sylvester Stallone simply get out of the van and run along the quays while Avildsen himself filmed from the side door. A similar story concerns the famous shot of Rocky jogging through the food market. As he runs, the stall keepers and the people on the sidewalks can clearly be seen looking at him in bemusement. While this works in the context of the film to suggest they're looking at Rocky, in reality, they had no idea why this man was running up and down the road being filmed from a van. During this scene, the famous shot where the stall-owner throws Rocky an orange was completely improvised by the stall owner-himself, who had no idea that a movie was being filmed and that he would be in it."", u'The highest-grossing movie of 1976.', u""The monologue which Rocky delivers after turning down Mickey's (Burgess Meredith) offer to manage him was completely improvised on-set by Sylvester Stallone. He has since explained that he was heavily influenced by the fact that the bathroom of the tiny apartment in which they were shooting really did stink."", u'Sylvester Stallone was inspired to write the screenplay for the film, after seeing the Chuck Wepner-Muhammad Ali fight on March 24, 1975, at the Richfield Coliseum outside of Cleveland in Richfield, Ohio. Thirty-six year old Wepner was considered a moderate talent, but no one thought he had a hope against Ali. Indeed, no one expected Wepner to last more than three rounds. As such, the longer the fight went on past the opening three rounds, the more shocked people became; Wepner even managed to knock Ali down in the ninth round (although Ali has always maintained that Wepner was standing on his foot when he fell). Ali immediately opened a blistering offensive in an attempt to drop Wepner and for the next six rounds, he pummeled Wepner mercilessly, breaking his nose and opening large gashes above both his eyes. No matter how hard Ali hit him however, Wepner kept moving forward and continuing to fight (it was this specific aspect of the fight which inspired Stallone). Eventually, with 19 seconds left in the fifteenth and final round, Ali scored a TKO. Wepner\'s story was adapted forty years later as Chuck (2016); its advertisement specifically capitalized the fact that it was ""the inspiration for Rocky"".', u'During his audition, Carl Weathers was sparring with Sylvester Stallone and accidentally punched him on the chin. Stallone told Weathers to calm down, as it was only an audition, and Weathers said that if he was allowed to audition with a \'real\' actor, not a stand-in, he would be able to do a lot better. Director John G. Avildsen smiled and told Weathers that Stallone was the real actor (and the writer). Weathers looked at Stallone thoughtfully for a moment, and said, ""Well, maybe he\'ll get better."" Stallone immediately offered him the role.', u'Sylvester Stallone quit smoking cigarettes while making this film, because he was getting out of breath.', u'In an interview Sylvester Stallone was asked if he and Elvis Presley ever met. Stallone said that in 1976 after ""Rocky"" was released, Elvis contacted him and asked him to visit Graceland and a bring a copy of the film with him. Stallone told the interviewer that he was too afraid to meet Elvis, and he didn\'t go, but he did send a copy of the film. Apparently, Elvis did indeed watch the film with some friends.', u""The ice rink scene was originally written to feature 300 extras, but the production couldn't afford so many people. When Sylvester Stallone turned up to shoot the scene, to his horror, there was only one extra. So, Stallone hastily threw together the scene as it exists in the completed film. Ironically, this scene has become one of the most popular in the entire Rocky saga."", u'The iconic shot of Rocky running up the steps of Philadelphia Art Museum came about because of Steadicam inventor Garrett Brown. Brown, who was from Philadelphia, was getting ready to fly to Los Angeles to try to sell his newly invented Steadicam device. He had shot some test footage following people around corridors and from room to room, but he wanted to be able to shoot something that even the most experienced filmmakers would look at and wonder how he did it. He came up with the idea for his girlfriend to run up and down the museum steps while he followed close behind her. Using this footage, Brown sold the camera on his first day in Los Angeles and, several months later, John G. Avildsen, who was prepping Rocky, saw the footage and felt that a similar type of shot would be perfect for the film. As such, Avildsen hired Brown and the Steadicam, and as Brown explains, several months after he had run up the steps filming his girlfriend, he was running back up the steps filming Sylvester Stallone.', u'Burgess Meredith got the part of Mickey, because the other actors they considered for the role were insulted that Sylvester Stallone wanted them to read for it.', u""Although Sylvester Stallone famously wrote the first draft of the script in three days, it went through nine sizable rewrites before it was purchased by Irwin Winkler and Robert Chartoff.

Avildsen decided that the scenes needed to be shot in a unique way so as to make the boxing more realistic than in other boxing movies of the period. He, Weathers and Stallone all went to a ring and began to block out the moves, but it wasn't working, and the fight was coming across as staged and not very energetic. After stuntmen/fight choreographers Paul Stader and George P. Wilbur resigned due to creative disagreements, Avildsen then told Stallone to go home and literally write out the fight; 'Rocky throws a left, Creed moves back, Creed goes right, Rocky goes right Creed jabs low etc'. The next day, Stallone returned with 32 pages of specific directions for the fight, which he and Weathers learned off like a ballet over a period of a few weeks. In total, Stallone and Weathers rehearsed for over 35 hours."", u'Originally, the filmmakers wanted several former heavyweight champions to appear at the beginning of the fight between Rocky and Apollo. They put out a call for all former champions to show, but on the day of the shoot only Joe Frazier turned up. The filmmakers thought it worked well however, because Frazier is a resident of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, which was where the movie was shot and took place.', u'The film was ultimately green-lit by United Artists by a misunderstanding of sorts. Mike Medavoy was the United Artist\'s top man in Los Angeles, and he loved the project, but he needed to convince the head office in New York City. Arthur Krim, United Artists CEO at the time, said he\'d consider it, but he wanted to know more about the writer Sylvester Stallone, who was also going to star. Stallone had recently appeared in a film called The Lords of Flatbush (1974), where he had also gotten a writing credit for \'additional dialogue\'. Medavoy thought Stallone was excellent in the piece, so he sent a copy of the film to New York City, and told them to watch it. The film is about a Brooklyn street gang, and alongside Stallone, it featured unknowns Perry King, Henry Winkler and Paul Mace. During the screening, Krim asked the executives viewing the film, ""Which one is Stallone?"", and someone told him that it was the blond kid (actually Perry King). Krim pointed out that that guy didn\'t look Italian, and Stallone was an Italian name, to which he was told Stallone must be from Northern Italy, where there are a lot of blue eyed, blond haired Italians. Krim thought about this for a moment and then announced that he liked this guy Stallone (still talking about King), and so he green-lit the movie.

Sylvester Stallone actually stayed up all night filming the scene of him forging the knife like you see in the film, although due to time constrictions, he had to do it all at once without cooling the blade. They went through about seven pairs of heat protective gloves due to this. Sly claims after making the knife, he had a rather warm handshake."", u""Sylvester Stallone specifically wanted the film to be set in the midst of the most brutal ongoing global conflict that was basically ignored by the public and media. After ruling out established (and well-known) conflicts in the Middle East, Latin America and Africa, Stallone talked to international experts who told him about the Burmese junta's mass murder of the Karen people. He then set the movie's storyline in the middle of this genocide."", u'Originally, Rambo was supposed to hold the M2 .50-cal. machine gun in his hands and fire it, but when fully assembled the weapon weighed 120 pounds.

However, returning Iraq and Afghanistan veterans who had used the M2 in combat noted that the wounds were quite accurate, and if anything, toned down from reality.

Rambo's last stand in the finale is very similar to the actions Murphy took that resulted in his being awarded the Medal of Honor--manning a 50.-cal. machine gun mounted on a vehicle (in that case, a tank) and singlehandedly holding off hundreds of enemy soldiers, killing dozens. However, in Murphy's case the tank he was firing from had been disabled and was on fire, and the cannon shells and ammunition it was carrying could have exploded at any moment."", u""The first Rambo film to break the pattern of greatly escalating the budget from one film to the next, it cost fifty million dollars, while it's predecessor cost 63 million dollars."", u'Ted Kotcheff who directed First Blood (1982), acts as a technical consultant on this particular installment.', u'The first Rambo film directed by Sylvester Stallone.', u""During the montage after Rambo is asked to transport the mercenaries, it shows the alternate ending to First Blood (1982) where Colonel Trautman (Richard Crenna) would have ended Rambo's revenge on Teasle by shooting him in the abdomen."", u'While filming near Burma, Sylvester Stallone and the rest of the crew narrowly avoided being shot by the Burmese military.

Stallone added that he ""feared for his life"" while shooting. ""We were told we could get seriously hurt if we went on.

In several countries, including France and Germany, the film is called ""John Rambo."" In Russia, the film is called ""Rambo 4.""', u'Rambo is addressed as ""boatman"" during the movie. From Greek mythology, ""Charon"" (the boatman) ferried souls to the land of the dead for money. Burma/Myanmar, with a 60+ year civil war and genocide, qualifies as the land of the dead. Also, the name of the rebel faction is ""Karen"" which is pronounced like ""Charon"".', u""During its long development process, this film went through a few different story premises. One unproduced script featured Rambo living a quiet life with wife and child, until white supremacists kidnap his family.

This Christmas.']","[u""During preproduction, as the filmmakers tried to find a good location to shoot the fight, they met with constant obstacles - every suitable arena was booked out. Sylvester Stallone knew that HBO had an upcoming PPV event with Bernard Hopkins taking on Jermaine Taylor in the main event, at the Mandalay Resort and Casino in Las Vegas. Stallone suggested that the film could piggyback the real event, using the real HBO format, the real crowd, even the real press conference setup. As such, the press conference scene was shot only moments after the real press conference with Hopkins and Taylor, whilst the scene when Rocky walks through the curtain and down to the ring was shot using the real Hopkins/Taylor crowd. Stallone was hoping that the crowd wouldn't boo or cause any problems, but as he made his way to the ring (as Rocky), the whole building gave him a standing ovation and began to chant 'ROCKY, ROCKY'. The crowd was never told to stand up or to chant - they had done it completely on their own, and according to the filmmakers, by far the biggest cheer of the night was for Rocky, not for any of the real fighters."", u""The bout between Rocky and Dixon was filmed with actors Sylvester Stallone and Antonio Tarver really hitting one another. According to Stallone, not a single punch in the fight was pulled, and every hit on film was a hit for real. Furthermore, Stallone has revealed that the scene where Rocky is knocked down for a 9 count, and is trying to get to his feet by taking hold of the rope, but is having difficulty focusing on it, is completely genuine; Tarver really did knock him down, and he really couldn't get up."", u'According to Sylvester Stallone, the shot of Rocky standing alone on the museum steps before the second set of end credits was actually filmed without him knowing.', u'According to Stallone, Carl Weathers does not appear in the film because Weathers wanted a role in the film, even though his character Apollo Creed had died in Rocky IV (1985); Stallone refused, so Weathers refused to grant Stallone permission to use archive footage of him. The brief clip of the fight between Rocky and Apollo was recreated using a body double.', u""The film was partially inspired by the George Foreman-Michael Moorer fight in 1994. Foreman had formerly retired from boxing in 1977, but in 1987, the 38 year old had decided to make a comeback. This comeback culminated in 1994 when the, by then, 45 year old Foreman, challenged the 26 year old world heavyweight champion Michael Moorer. The fight took place on November 5 in Las Vegas. For nine rounds, Moorer toyed with Foreman, easily out-boxing him. Entering the tenth round, Foreman was trailing on all scorecards. However, in the tenth round, completely out of nowhere, Foreman landed a vicious shot to Moorer's chin, knocking the younger man out and scoring a TKO victory, becoming the oldest world heavyweight champion in history."", u'Until Creed (2015), Sylvester Stallone insisted that this would be the last Rocky film.', u'The film contains flashbacks from every Rocky film except Rocky V (1990).', u'Pedro Lovell reprises his role as Spider Rico, the boxer defeated by Rocky in the opening scene of Rocky (1976).', u'Sylvester Stallone said that he decided to make this movie, because he was so unhappy with the ending of Rocky V (1990). He actually wanted to make this film back in 1999, but it would not get green-lit until six years later.', u'All of the Rocky training scenes in the gym were shot in one 17-hour shoot.', u""The film was shot in 38 days. The very first thing to be shot was the fight between Dixon and Rocky. This was done because Sylvester Stallone's training (which had been going on for six months) had to stop once the film went into production and he began to concentrate on directing. If the fight had been left until the end of the schedule, Stallone would not have been in as good shape as he was at the start."", u'According to Sylvester Stallone in his DVD Commentary, he did consider having his real-life son Sage Stallone reprise the role of Robert ""Rocky"" Jr. which he had played in Rocky V (1990), but he decided against it because he feared people would read too much into the personal conflict between Rocky and Robert regarding Robert\'s belief that he is ""living in his father\'s shadow"".', u'In the scene in the meat factory between Paulie and Rocky, Paulie asks if Rocky is angry because they took down his statue, a possible reference to the real life controversy which surrounded the statue. During the making of Rocky III (1982), a 9ft tall, 1500-pound bronze statue designed by A. Thomas Schomberg was placed at the top of the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Arts. After filming wrapped, Sylvester Stallone tried to donate the statue to the museum but they said they didn\'t want it, sparking a huge debate between the Museum and the City\'s Art Commission about what constituted \'art\'. The museum claimed the statue was nothing more than a ""movie prop"", and didn\'t want it. Local people were outraged, and the statue was ultimately placed in front of the Wachovia Spectrum in South Philadelphia. It was later returned to the Art Museum for the filming of Rocky V (1990), after which it was again moved to the front of the Spectrum.', u'In his DVD commentary, Sylvester Stallone explains that some of Rocky\'s dialogue with Marie (Geraldine Hughes) was improvised on-set. For example, for the scene where he installs the light bulb, Stallone had no idea the bulb would be so bright, and his reaction to the glare is completely genuine. The line to Marie about meetings Steps\' father on a cruise ship was another improvised line, as was his observation that he\'s a better dancer then the average bear. Stallone was so surprised with himself for coming up with this comparison, that his next line, ""Where that came from, I don\'t know"", was also improvised.', u'The computer simulation fight was based on The Super Fight (1970) which pitted Muhammad Ali against Rocky Marciano. Every possible scenario was considered and filmed and the computer decided that Marciano would win in the 13th round. When told of the result, Ali retorted ""that computer was made in Alabama"".', u""Sylvester Stallone explains in Skill vs. Will: The Making of 'Rocky Balboa' (2007) that Milo Ventimiglia landed the role of Robert, Jr. in part because of the similarities between their mouths; if you look closely, you can see that Ventimiglia's mouth hooks down in much the same way as Stallone's does."", u'In earlier drafts of the screenplay, Rocky\'s former opponents Clubber Lang and Ivan Drago had cameo appearances. Clubber would have been a ringside commentator for the bout with Dixon and made disparaging remarks about Rocky. The scene with Drago had Rocky visiting him in a hospital where he is dying of AIDS from steroid abuse. Supposedly Rocky would have told a nurse, ""If he dies, he dies"" - the same line Drago said about Apollo Creed in the fourth movie. Both of these scenes were eventually removed from the script.', u""In the DVD commentary for his film First Blood (1982) Sylvester Stallone recalls an incident during filming where a girl in the town bar pretended to be a fan of his in order to try and wheedle a free round of drinks out of him. He later includes just such a scene in 'Rocky Balboa'."", u'According to Sylvester Stallone, Antonio Tarver held up filming of the fight scene and demanded a higher salary. He refused to start filming until he was guaranteed more money. Stallone gave up a large part of his own salary and paid it to Tarver.', u'The paintings made by Paulie in the film were done by Burt Young, an avid painter.', u'Adrian Balboa has a real grave in Philly.', u'According to an interview with Mark S. Driscoll of Look! Effects, one of the fight scenes uses backgrounds from an earlier fight which Sylvester Stallone actually attended prior to filming. He said it should be possible to see Stallone (as himself) in the audience while Stallone (as Rocky) is in the ring.', u""As he had done with the previous five films, writer Sylvester Stallone incorporated a great deal of biographical material into this film. As Stallone himself explains on the DVD commentary, to a certain extent, Mason Dixon is based on himself; a man who has made some bad decisions after taking advice from people who didn't really have his best interests at heart."", u'After the release of the film, critics hailed the fighting scenes as the most realistic in the entire Rocky saga. On the DVD, Sylvester Stallone hypothesizes that a major factor in this realism was that he used realistic sound-effects for punches. When a punch lands in the film, the sound used was a real punch, whereas in previous films, sounds used for punches had included shotgun blasts, broken bottles, chains and baseball bats hitting wet leather.', u'On the DVD commentary, Sylvester Stallone says he based the idea of Rocky owning a restaurant and spending his time telling old fight stories on former world heavyweight champion Jack Dempsey.', u""According to Sylvester Stallone, they put both endings (one with Dixon winning by decision, and one with Rocky winning by decision) on the DVD so that fans could choose how they want the character's saga to end."", u""Adrian Balboa was alive in the first few drafts of the script, while Robert Balboa was in the U.S. Air Force, then titled Rocky VI: Puncher's Chance. At this point, the story revolved around Rocky running a local gym for youths. However, Sylvester Stallone felt that the film lacked the necessary emotional impact it needed. So, he and Talia Shire came to an agreement that her character would be best left out of the film, as this would create an emotional chasm for Rocky from the very first moment of the film. To ensure that fans did not think she had been written out of the film because of a dispute with Stallone or because she refused to be in it, Shire made a public statement supporting Stallone's decision to kill off the character."", u'""Take You Back"", the song which opens the film, was first performed by Frank Stallone on a street corner in the original Rocky.', u'Andy (Don Sherman), the bartender from Rocky (1976), Rocky III (1982) and Rocky V (1990) can briefly be seen in this film sitting in a wheelchair in the background of his bar cheering on Rocky during the fight. Andy originally had a more sizable role, but the scene was cut from the finished film.', u""Although it is not included as a deleted scene on the DVD, Sylvester Stallone has said that a scene was filmed in which Rocky sees a woman that looks like Adrian in the building where Robert, Jr. works. He follows her for a while before he realizes it is not Adrian. Stallone decided to cut the scene because he felt that Rocky's loneliness had already been established enough, and that this scene was overkill."", u'Sylvester Stallone initially wanted Roy Jones, Jr. for the role of Mason Dixon. Stallone claims that he left 31 phone messages for Jones but never received a response.', u'Sylvester Stallone originally wanted to film Rambo (2008) before he could film Rocky Balboa (2006). However, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) gave him the green-light and Stallone had to put Rambo on hold.', u'In the fight between Dixon and Balboa, one of the commentators says, ""Balboa was hit so hard his ancestors must have felt it"" This is possibly a reference to the real fight between Muhammad Ali (then Cassius Clay) and Henry Cooper in 1963. In an interview with Ali after the fight, in which he was knocked down, Ali explained, ""He (Cooper) hit me so hard, my ancestors in Africa felt it.""', u'Assuming standard sized gym weights, during the ""Gonna Fly Now"" workout scene, Rocky was benching 365 pounds, snatch and lifting 315 pounds, and squatting 495 pounds.', u'Mike Tyson improvised his lines.', u""According to Jodi Letizia's lawyer, Sylvester Stallone had promised her that she would reprise her role as Marie in this film. When Letizia learned that that Geraldine Hughes had been cast in the role instead, she filed a lawsuit against Stallone, claiming that she had cleared her entire schedule to prepare for the filming. The lawsuit was eventually settled."", u'Sylvester Stallone trained for six months to get in shape for his role.', u'This is the only Rocky sequel not to contain a recap from its predecessor.', u'Antonio Tarver (the real light heavyweight champion at the time of production) trained for 5 weeks prior to the film and had to put on 25 pounds.', u'This film was shipped to theaters under the code name ""Nobody Parties"".', u'All of the arena material was filmed in HD to match the HBO PPV look; the rest of the film was shot on standard 35mm.', u""The championship belts used in the movie were actually those of Antonio Tarver, who played Mason 'The Line' Dixon. If you look closely in the scene where Steps is looking over Rocky's memorabilia, you'll see on the WBC Championship Belt photos of 'Joe Louis', Muhammad Ali, and two of its owner - Antonio Tarver."", u'In one shot where Rocky walks out of the restaurant to talk to his son you can clearly see him (Rocky) wearing a Dempsy t-shirt/sweater, apparently as a tribute to former world heavyweight champion Jack Dempsey.', u'This is the only film in the Rocky series which actually plays Bill Conti\'s ""Gonna Fly Now"" over the closing credits.', u""Composer Bill Conti only wrote one original piece of music for the film; Marie's theme."", u'There is a subplot about Paulie having a girlfriend that did not make the final cut, however, the deleted scenes can be seen on the DVD.', u""The only Rocky movie where the famous red, white, and blue boxing trunks aren't being worn, even though the trunks are briefly shown through the use of archive footage. In Rocky II (1979), they are only seen in the opening scene, which was the fight from the previous film."", u'According to her gravestone, Adrian Balboa was born on March 10, 1950, and died on January 11, 2002 (""woman cancer"", according to Rocky).', u'This is the only movie in the first six Rocky films not to begin with Rocky in a boxing match.', u'The computer fight was shot with Sylvester Stallone and Antonio Tarver wearing motion capturing outfits.', u""The original title of the film was Rocky VI: Puncher's Chance."", u""In 2005, Sylvester Stallone published a men's fitness magazine called Sly. Although the magazine only lasted four issues, Stallone included portions of his script for this movie, including illustrations of some scenes. The drawing of Mason Dixon does not resemble Antonio Tarver, as the part had not yet been cast."", u""In the end credits where everyone is reenacting Rocky's iconic run up the steps, Sylvester Stallone's wife, Jennifer Flavin, is shown doing it as well."", u'No traditional soundtrack was released for the film. Instead, a CD called ""Rocky Balboa - The Best of Rocky"" was released, featuring a collection of the best songs from the entire franchise. The release date of that compilation album (December 26, 2006) also coincided with the 30th anniversary re-release of the original soundtrack to Rocky (1976).', u'This was the first film that Sylvester Stallone directed since Rocky IV (1985).', u""The fight scene happened right after an actual boxing event, so people who were there for a pay-per-view match got to see the ending scene. This was Sylvester Stallone's choice so he can make the fight as realistic as possible by actually taking and giving hits."", u""James Binns had 2 different characters - Rocky's attorney in Rocky V (1990) and a boxing commissioner in this film."", u'Every main opponent that Rocky faces throughout the series is both taller and heavier than he is.', u'Before the fight between Dixon and Balboa, Mason Dixon is introduced as being from Tampa, Florida. Antonio Tarver (the real-life boxer who plays Dixon) is also from Tampa.', u'The HBO broadcast team for the fight is Jim Lampley, Max Kellerman, and Larry Merchant. Normally, HBO does not use both Kellerman and Merchant on the same broadcast. It would not be until five years later that this trio actually worked a real boxing broadcast together.', u""While the dramatic portions of the movie are shot in an obviously cinematic style, the bout between Balboa and Dixon is shot in several different ways. The lead-in to the bout, as well as the first two rounds, are shot in a style similar to a major pay-per-view broadcast. Clips from fights in previous Rocky movies are used during the introductory teaser to introduce Balboa, while stock footage from actual Tarver fights, as well as footage from Dixon's previous fight (shown at the beginning of the film) are used as clips for Dixon's part of the teaser. The fight itself was shot in high definition to further enhance the television-style look of the fight."", u'According to the behind-the-scenes documentary on the DVD, there were slight continuity problems during the filming of the fight. This was said to have been due to the fact that real punches were thrown by both Sylvester Stallone and Antonio Tarver, resulting in some swelling and nosebleeds earlier than scripted. The DVD release features an alternate ending in which Rocky wins the fight (also by a split decision).', u""At one point in the movie, Rocky cracks a few eggs in a glass and drinks them. It's a nod to the original Rocky (1976) when Rocky does the same thing."", u'In one scene, Rocky mistakenly identifies ""Little"" Marie\'s son and comments that he has her ""big Irish hair"". Even though Rocky is wrong about which boy the son is, actress Geraldine Hughes is, coincidentally, from Ireland.', u""When Duke is talking to Rocky before the training montage, he says that Rocky will have to hit Mason so hard that it will rattle his ancestors. Later, during the final fight scene, Rocky is hit by Mason, and a commentator remarks that Rocky's ancestors must have felt that punch."", u""This was Sylvester Stallone's most successful film since Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over (2003)."", u'A new song, ""Still Here"" by Natasha Bedingfield (written by Diane Warren) was to be featured prominently in the film but was dropped. The song is still listed in the closing credits. The song appears on the UK version of the album ""Rocky Balboa: The Best of Rocky"".', u'In an article of Sports Illustrated, Tommy Morrison, who played the character, Tommy Gunn in Rocky V (1990), tried contacting Sylvester Stallone about reprising his character for this film, but nothing became of it.', u""According to actor Milo Ventimiglia, his casting as Sylvester Stallone's son was due in part to Stallone noticing that they have similar mouth and lip movements when they speak."", u""Adrian's Restaurant is marked as opening since 1995. The same year of the release of two Stallone movies, Judge Dredd (1995) and Assassins (1995)."", u'Under the name of Rocky\'s restaurant ""Adrian\'s"", ""Est. 1995"" appears, meaning that when Rocky meets again with Marie, he has been the owner for eleven years.', u'In 1984, ""Weird Al"" Yankovic made a song called ""Theme from Rocky XIII"" parodying Survivor\'s ""The Eye of the Tiger"" that told of Rocky no longer boxing but now owning a deli and catering service. Parts of the story-line of this movie mirror this song.', u'Around 9 minutes into the film, when Rocky first walks into his restaurant ""Adrian\'s"", he\'s talking to his pregnant hostess and asks ""how\'s your stomach?"" Rocky asks this very same question to his wife, Adrian, in Rocky II (1979).', u'The very last scene to be shot was Rocky\'s sprint up the steps at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Sylvester Stallone purposely left this shot until the end because he knew it would be such an emotional experience due to the iconic nature of the scene, and he felt it was a good way for him to say goodbye to the character. As he puts it himself, ""that run is the distillation of the entire Rocky experience.""', u'Sylvester Stallone was actually knocked unconscious while filming the final fight scene.', u'Stallone\'s original cut of the film ran near 2 1/2 hours. This cut of the film played to sneak preview audiences on May 15th, 2006. This was before MGM demanded Stallone cut the film down to an hour and forty-five minutes (the release print eventually ran an hour and forty-two minutes). Scenes cut out that are not included on the DVD release include:    -After talking with his son, Rocky follows a woman up an escalator, thinking she\'s Adrian. When he gets to her, he discovers she, of course, isn\'t.    -There were many more visits to Adrian\'s grave in the original cut.    -Rocky\'s brain damage being shown to have not been brain damage at all was trimmed from the license scene.    -Two training sequences: one of Rocky doing weight training as well as Mason Dixon doing his training to the tune of Survivor\'s ""Fire Makes Steel"" and afterward was a Rocky-only training sequence scored with ""Gonna Fly Now"". These two sequences were squished together for the final print.    -Before the fight, Marie and Rocky share a hug.    -Rocky says hi to Mike Tyson before the fight.    -The film was also shot with four endings so as not to spoil the end to the watching crowd.

Lundgren threw Weathers across the ring before it was broken up.', u""When shooting the film, Sylvester Stallone decided that for the shooting of the fight, he and Dolph Lundgren should hit one another for real, so as to increase the intensity of the scene. After doing three takes of Rocky taking shots to ribs, Stallone felt a burning in his chest, but ignored it. Later that night, he had difficulty breathing and was taken to a nearby emergency room. It was discovered that his blood pressure was over 200, and he had to be flown on a low-altitude flight from Canada to St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica, where he remained in intensive care for four days.

This event caused a four-day work stoppage while Weathers was talked back into the part and Lundgren agreed to tone down his aggressiveness.', u""If you look carefully at the very opening scene (the American glove and the Russian glove colliding), you can see that a split second after the gloves collide and a split second before they're covered by the explosion, the Russian glove breaks in half and falls to the ground."", u'Over 8,000 people auditioned for the part of Ivan Drago.', u'According to Sylvester Stallone, Ivan Drago returned home in disgrace and became addicted to alcohol and steroids before committing suicide.', u'During a practice round, Sylvester Stallone told Dolph Lundgren to ""really go at it"" like how normal boxers do for 15 seconds. He ended up with a swelling pericardia sac around his heart and had to be rushed to the emergency room by plane. His insurance company thought he was faking it, saying that his injuries looked more ""from head-on collisions when the steering wheels hit you in the chest"". Stallone replied, ""Have you seen Dolph Lundgren?! That\'s a truck! That\'s a steering wheel! That\'s a head-on collision!"" His insurance company honored the claim soon after that.', u'Rocky IV was the highest grossing film in the Rocky series, taking in just over 300 million dollars worldwide.', u'It took Dolph Lundgren about six months to win the part and was first turned down by the casting directors for being too tall. Later, he got the chance to send photos and meet Sylvester Stallone who told him he had a good chance to get the part, but advised him to gain twenty pounds of muscle.', u'The ""hit the one in the middle"" exchange, long part of boxing lore, actually did happen during the Max Baer-Max Schmeling heavyweight fight in June 1933. Baer was knocked groggy by a Schmeling right hand in the first round and told his corner, ""I see three of him out there."" Ex-champ Jack Dempsey, who was in Baer\'s corner for the fight, responded with the famous line, and Baer went on to score a tenth-round knockout.', u'In the Italian dub of the movie, Ivan Drago\'s line ""I must break you"", was translated as ""I break you in two"" (""Ti spiezzo in due"", complete with fake Russian accent).

However, he noted the damage both boxers sustained in the fight made them ""incapable of reason"" and thus instead planned Rocky V (1990) as a showcase of the dangers of boxing.', u'This was the last film that Sylvester Stallone directed until Rocky Balboa (2006).', u'The film is recognized as being ahead of its time in its demonstration of ground-breaking high-tech sporting equipment, some of which was experimental and twenty years from public use.', u'At 91 minutes, this the shortest of all the films in the Rocky series.', u""Numerous fans have stated that they find this film to be confusing in terms of the title belt, and what exactly happens to it when Rocky is in Russia. This is most likely because the scene explaining what would happen to the belt was cut from the film, and replaced with a newspaper montage. Initially, between Apollo's funeral and the Rocky/Drago press conference, there was to be a scene in which Rocky visits the U.S. boxing board. While there, he is told that they will not sanction the fight, and if he goes ahead with it, he will not be allowed to carry the title. This scene was cut prior to release as it was felt it would slow up the film too much, and it was replaced with the much briefer newspaper montage."", u""This is the first film in which Gonna Fly Now is not sung, although a few bars of the song are incorporated into Vince DiCola's score.

Sylvester Stallone likely incorporated her as a last minute rewrite."", u'This is the only Rocky film where the music is not composed by Bill Conti.', u""The script development was the subject of a famous copyright lawsuit, Anderson v. Stallone. Timothy Anderson developed a treatment for Rocky IV on spec. After the studio decided not to buy his treatment, he sued when the resulting movie script was similar to his treatment. The court held that Anderson had prepared an unauthorized derivative work of the characters Sylvester Stallone had developed in Rocky I through III, and thus he couldn't enforce his unauthorized story extension against the owner of the character's copyrights."", u'This is the only Rocky film that doesn\'t begin with the word ""ROCKY"" scrolling across the screen in some shape or form.', u""During the training montage, Rocky grabs a black and white picture of Drago off his mirror frame and crumbles it up just like Apollo did with Rocky's picture in Rocky II (1979)."", u'The Soviet Premier in the sky box during the Rocky-Drago match strongly resembles contemporary Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.

Eventually, after Stallone began to hit him, Shavers lost his temper and punched him under the ribs, doubling Stallone over.

The city had refused to keep the prop in front of the world-class museum, and Sylvester Stallone shipped the statue back to Los Angeles. But little Nikol mounted a campaign to bring the statue back.  She set up a table outside Veterans Stadium the night Pete Rose passed Stan Musial on the list of all-time hits leader, and gathered 2,000 signatures. In all, she collected more than 10,000 and presented them to City Council. Stallone was grateful.

In reality, Stallone experienced a similar sense of being quickly forgotten after his two post-Rocky (1976) movies, Paradise Alley (1978) (Stallone's directorial debut) and F.I.S.T.

Although, he was fond of Stallone's original concepts for the two films which would have made the series a trilogy. The plots would have consisted of Rocky going into politics, running for Mayor of Philadelphia on the Reform Ticket, and winning. Only to have be scandalized, when Paulie is caught stealing from the treasury.
