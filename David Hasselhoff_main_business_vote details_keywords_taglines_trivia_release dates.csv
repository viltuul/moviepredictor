""Deus Ex Machina"" is a Latin phrase meaning ""god from the machine,"" and is derived from a plot device in ancient Greek drama by which a ""god"" was lowered to the stage by a crane (""machine"") to solve a problem which the human characters could not. It\'s used to describe an improbable event bringing a solution to a seemingly impossible problem. The ""deus ex machina"" in this film takes place when Peter bets on Average Joe\'s to win the final tournament by using the bribe money White paid him, then using his winnings from the bet to buy the majority stocks of Globo Gym, thereby becoming the owner of both Average Joe\'s and Globo Gym.', u'At the end of the movie, ESPN 8 announcer Cotton McKnight says, ""Do you believe in unlikelihoods? Yes!"" This comment is a play on the famous exclamation by Al Michaels, when the USA beat Russia in hockey at the 1980 Olympics, saying, ""Do you believe in miracles? Yes!""', u""The DVD contains an alternate ending where Average Joe's loses the final match, and the film goes to the credits as the announcer exclaims that they are going home with absolutely nothing.

Down goes Goodman!"" This is a reference to Howard Cosell\'s famous call from the Heavyweight 1973 championship fight between George Foreman and Joe Frazier, in which he yelled, ""Down goes Frazier! Down goes Frazier!""', u'After the credits, when the morbidly obese White Goodman does a little dance to Kelis\' ""Milkshake"" song, it is a reference to a viral video clip that circulated on the Internet, where an extremely large black woman does the same dance.', u'In the scene where Me\'Shell walks in on White shoving pizza down his pants, Whites ""G"" pendant on his necklace becomes unhooked and dangles mysteriously from his shirt and is clearly not on the chain anymore.']","[u'USA::18 June 2004', u'Denmark::21 August 2004 (Copenhagen International Film Festival)', u'UK::27 August 2004', u'Ireland::27 August 2004', u'Mexico::27 August 2004', u'Philippines::8 September 2004 (Manila)', u'Australia::9 September 2004', u'Spain::10 September 2004', u'Malta::15 September 2004', u'Belgium::22 September 2004', u'France::22 September 2004', u'Philippines::22 September 2004 (Davao)', u'Netherlands::23 September 2004', u'Denmark::24 September 2004', u'United Arab Emirates::29 September 2004', u'Israel::29 September 2004', u'Switzerland::30 September 2004 (German speaking region)', u'Germany::30 September 2004', u'Austria::1 October 2004', u'Estonia::1 October 2004', u'Iceland::1 October 2004', u'Sweden::1 October 2004', u'Colombia::8 October 2004', u'Panama::8 October 2004', u'Portugal::11 October 2004', u'Bahrain::13 October 2004', u'Czech Republic::14 October 2004', u'Slovakia::14 October 2004', u'Peru::21 October 2004', u'Brazil::22 October 2004', u'Finland::22 October 2004', u'Turkey::22 October 2004', u'Ecuador::29 October 2004', u'Hong Kong::4 November 2004', u'Hungary::4 November 2004', u'Thailand::4 November 2004', u'Italy::5 November 2004', u'South Korea::12 November 2004', u'Norway::19 November 2004', u'Poland::19 November 2004', u'Greece::26 November 2004', u'Romania::3 December 2004', u'Venezuela::10 December 2004', u'Chile::13 January 2005', u'Japan::25 February 2005 (Yubari International Fantastic Film Festival)', u'Argentina::23 March 2005 (video premiere)', u'Japan::29 April 2005 (Tokyo)']"

In television parlance, this is called a ""walk and talk"" scene, though some ""West Wing"" fans also dubbed the exchanges ""pedeconferences"". This element became so identified with the show, that a ""Mad TV"" parody of ""The West Wing"" consisted almost entirely of the characters walking (and then running) through the halls of the White House, and when Aaron Sorkin appeared on 30 Rock (2006), his role consisted of him and Tina Fey (Liz) walking in a big circle while talking about writing for television.', u'Actors originally considered to play the President included Alan Alda, Sidney Poitier, and Jason Robards, Jr.', u'The theme of this show, from the pilot to episode four differed from subsequent episodes, as it was performed on a synthesizer.

However, whereas his character in this show is a good man, and benevolent leader, in The Dead Zone (1983), he was a twisted, evil tyrant intent on nuclear war."", u'The theme music for ""Capitol Beat"", the news show hosted by Mark Gottfried (Ted McGinley), is actually the theme music for the UK\'s Independent Television News (ITN)\'s News At Ten and Night Time News bulletin, a genuine and award winning news program. The theme is a short passage taken from a piece by Johnny Pearson, called ""The Awakening"", itself part of a longer composition called ""20th Century Portrait"".', u'Over the course of the series, fifteen different actors and actresses appeared in the main credits: Allison Janney, John Spencer, Martin Sheen, Bradley Whitford, Janel Moloney, Richard Schiff, Dul\xe9 Hill, Rob Lowe, Joshua Malina, Stockard Channing, Mary McCormack, Jimmy Smits, Kristin Chenoweth, Alan Alda, and Moira Kelly.', u'In season one, episode nineteen, ""Let Bartlet Be Bartlet"", during the meeting in the Roosevelt room about gay soldiers in the military, Toby makes his point by sarcastically asking ""What the hell is going on at Lackland Air Force Base?""

While filming the scene, the sprinklers went off due to the heat caused by the production lights. The scenes were ultimately scrapped from the episode.', u""In April 2006, Executive Producer Lawrence O'Donnell told the New York Times, that until the death of John Spencer (Leo McGarry), the show's writers had planned to have the Republican candidate, Arnold Vinick, win the election, and not the Democrat candidate, Matthew Santos. O'Donnell said that after Spencer's death, the writers decided that it would be too sad for the audience, if Santos lost both his running mate (Leo) and the election at the same time."", u""During the sixth and seventh seasons, Toby's storyline concerns a leak to the press about the existence of a previously secret U.S. military space shuttle. In 2012, seven years after those episodes first aired, the U.S. Air Force admitted to having completed a classified 469-day military mission of a previously secret, unmanned, Boeing-built, reusable X-37B Orbital Test Vehicle. In other words, a secret U.S. military space shuttle."", u""Following the departure of Aaron Sorkin and Thomas Schlamme after season four, Richard Schiff felt that most of the new writers didn't really understand the character of Toby, and would write him just as grumpy, without nuances. Schiff ended up being unhappy with his work on the show, specially disliking Toby's storyline as the leak in the last season."", u'When Rob Lowe announced he would be leaving the show in the fourth season, among the names considered to replace him were Dermot Mulroney, Judd Nelson, Macaulay Culkin, and Jon Cryer. The job eventually went to Joshua Malina, a longtime friend of Aaron Sorkin, who has been in everything Sorkin has written, since he appeared as a member of the ensemble in Sorkin\'s play, ""A Few Good Men.""', u""When President Bartlet's longtime secretary and friend, Mrs. Landingham (Kathryn Joosten) died, her character was replaced by a new secretary, Deborah Fiderer (Lily Tomlin). Joosten's next long-term, recurring role on a television show was on Desperate Housewives (2004). When the producers introduced a sister for Joosten's character, they cast Lily Tomlin in the role."", u""According to an article in The New York Times (October 29, 2008), shortly after then-Illinois State Senator Barack Obama spoke at the 2004 Democratic National Convention, The West Wing (1999) Writer Eli Attie had several long telephone conversations with David Axelrod, a political consultant, who was then working on Obama's U.S. Senate campaign. From those conversations, Attie modeled the character of Matthew Santos after Obama's political and personal life. Like Santos, Obama eventually won his race for the presidency. Likewise, according to an article in The Guardian (November 6, 2008), the character of Josh Lyman was modeled after Representative Rahm Emanuel; on the show, Lyman became President Santos' Chief of Staff, while Obama's first staffing announcement after his 2008 election, was to name Emanuel as his Chief of Staff."", u'This show often reused the same names for different characters over the course of the series. Josh visited two different psychiatrists named ""Stanley;"" A Senator named ""Gianelli"" is mentioned (but never seen) before Ron Silver\'s character Bruno Gianelli becomes a regular character in season three;. Both the regular characters played by Ren\xe9e Estevez and Anna Deavere Smith are named ""Nancy"". In the season two episode, ""Bartlet\'s Third State of the Union"", the (unseen) President of Colombia is named Santos, and later in the series, the U. S. Representative, and eventual President, played by Jimmy Smits, is named Matt Santos. The Secretary of Agriculture, played by Harry Groener, is named Roger Tribbey, and the White House Counsel, played by John Larroquette, is named Lionel Tribbey. Both Donna and C.J. had memorable high school English teachers named ""Molly"", and after a Secret Service Agent named ""Molly"" is killed in the line of duty, while guarding Zoey Bartlet, Toby names his baby daughter ""Molly"", after her.']","[u'USA::22 September 1999', u'Norway::2000', u'Denmark::5 January 2000', u'Iceland::23 February 2000', u'Switzerland::5 September 2000 (French speaking region)', u'Portugal::7 September 2000', u'Israel::27 September 2000', u'Finland::28 September 2000', u'Croatia::2 October 2000', u'Sweden::30 October 2000', u'Australia::28 November 2000', u'UK::18 January 2001', u'Argentina::7 March 2001', u'Estonia::19 March 2001', u'Hungary::4 July 2001', u'France::6 July 2001', u'Turkey::5 December 2001', u'Japan::11 October 2002', u'Spain::13 November 2003', u'Germany::19 May 2008']"

Tartikoff and his assistant came up with a concept for a television show called, ""The Man of Six Words"". Each show would begin with the leading man getting out of a woman\'s bed and saying, ""Thank you"". Occasionally, throughout the show, the leading man would say, ""Okay"", when receiving orders from his boss. Then he would chase down some villains and say ""Freeze!"" Finally, when the people he had saved from death would thank him, he would say, ""You\'re welcome"". For the rest of the show, the car would do all the talking. Although Tartikoff had meant the pitch to be a joke, the NBC executives liked the idea of a television show about a man with a talking car, and approved it for development.', u'Super Pursuit Mode was introduced as a means of retaining viewers for a fourth season.', u'K.A.R.R. - (Knight Automated Roving Robot) (the evil Trans Am), was the prototype for K.I.T.T. But its system had only been programed for self-preservation, whereas K.I.T.T. is programed to preserve human life, its ""evil twin"" was not. The voice of K.A.R.R. was done by Peter Cullen, who is probably best known as the voice of Optimus Prime of ""The Transformers"", Cullen has also been voice to ""Predator"" and Eeyore of ""Winnie the Pooh"".', u""According to Car & Driver Magazine, K.I.T.T. was originally intended to be a modified Datsun 280ZX, but General Motors' recently introduced F-Body Firebird Trans Am was substituted in pre-production."", u'Much of the fan mail written to the series by younger viewers, was addressed to the name Michael Knight. Some of these letters were accidentally sent to actor Michael Knight, who was emerging as a popular cast member of the daytime drama All My Children (1970). Knight subsequently added his middle initial ""E"" to his screen name to avoid confusion. Interestingly, Michael E. Knight would later marry Catherine Hickland, who played Michael\'s love interest on this show, and was married to David Hasselhoff at the time of the series.', u'The second season saw the extensive use of miniatures provided by Jack Sessums for most of the really impossible stuff like jumping over trains, over helicopters, crashing into Goliath and ""walking on water"". The miniatures of K.I.T.T. were made to 1/8th scale, modified from the existing commercially available Monogram kit of the 1982 Camaro Z-28 to the same scale. Almost everything done involving trains were miniatures built by Sessums and his crew, as it turns out Sessums was a model train enthusiast who had large scale garden railway models already built, and the production crews made a lot of use of these models which for the most part were ready for use. The same model trains were also used in The Fall Guy (1981) and other similar productions of the time.', u'K.I.T.T. was designed by customizer Michael Scheffe. The convertible and Super Pursuit K.I.T.T.s were designed and built by George Barris.', u""K.I.T.T., the Knight Industries Two Thousand, was a customized 1982 Pontiac Trans Am. The 1982 model year was the first year of the third-generation (1982-1992) F-bodies (Chevrolet's Camaro and Pontiac's Firebird share the same platform), and was a complete redesign of the second generation."", u'The ""auto-cruise"" car was driven by a stunt driver inside the driver seat.', u'In season one, episode two, ""Knight of the Phoenix: Part 2"", while K.I.T.T. is driving back from the Sheriff\'s station, the driver is seen hidden in the driver\'s seat. Before Michael gets into the car, the driver\'s arm is visible, cleverly hidden with the upholstery.', u'The narrator of the show\'s opening credits was Richard Basehart, who played dying benefactor Wilton Knight in the pilot episode, ""Knight of the Phoenix: Part 1"".', u'The logo on the side of the semi-trailer of the truck K.I.T.T. is always seen driving into is a ""Knight"" chess piece.', u'Glen A.

However, David Hasselhoff complained that playing the dual role of Michael and Garthe was too demanding for him."", u'Throughout season one, there is another car that appears regularly besides K.I.T.T. and Devon\'s Mercedes-Benz convertible. It is a red 1974 (or thereabouts) AMC Gremlin X, possibly one of the crew\'s personal vehicles. It was never used in a ""supporting"" role, but only as a vehicular ""extra"", usually driving away from the camera.', u'K.I.T.T. was referred to as a ""Black Trans Am"" in early episodes of the first season, then later simply as a ""Black T-top"" for the rest of the series\' run.', u'Inside the F.L.A.G. (Foundation for Law and Government) truck trailer, in which K.I.T.T parks for repairs, a schematic diagram of a boat can often be seen. It is unknown if this was a concept for K.I.T.T or another F.L.A.G. project, but the design was never physically created in the series.', u'Glen A. Larson borrowed the idea of K.I.T.T.\'s hood mounted scanner from one of his earlier projects, Battlestar Galactica (1978). The Cylon Centurions in that series had an almost identical scanner that functioned as eyes, and Larson adapted the idea for K.I.T.T. Also, originally K.I.T.T. had a square red light on the dashboard that lit up as he spoke. His more familiar ""voice modulator"", with three red lines broken into cells which went up and down as he spoke, was introduced halfway through the first season.', u'In the Grand Theft Auto series of games since the release of Grand Theft Auto III (2001), its been a hugely popular modification to add K.I.T.T. to the game. These fan made mods have become so popular, that in 2016, Grand Theft Auto creators have made an official K.I.T.T. style car modification for Grand Theft Auto V (2013) that can be purchased legally. The car is not a one hundred percent replica of K.I.T.T., and has no A.I. voice, Auto Cruise, or Ski Mode, but does include scanner, turbo boost, and weaponry.', u'The character of Michael Knight was originally known as Michael Long, a cop who is shot in the desert and left for dead. Recovered by Wilton Knight and Devon Miles of Knight Industries, Mr. Long then undergoes reconstructive plastic surgery on his face. He is given a second chance at life, joining the Knight Industries team donning a new face and identity, he is Michael Knight, the Knight Rider. Other aliases include: Mr. Dugan in season one, episode ten, ""Inside Out"".', u'Michael Knight, formerly Vietnam Army Special Forces Intelligence veteran and Police Detective Lieutenant Michael Long, is noted in the credits and in the first season for being a preferred loner. There is never a mention of his family, parents or siblings, throughout the original series four year run.', u'Network executives suggested for season two that K.I.T.T. should fly. The Knight Rider cast and crew rejected the idea, saying it was a stupid idea, of which the show did not need to go in the direction, ruining what Knight Rider was about.', u'The continuation of this show after season four has multiple alternate realities, where the world of Knight Rider ended up, with no connections between the alternate dimensions. The first being what became Knight Rider 2000 (1991), the second being Team Knight Rider (1997), and the third being Knight Rider (2008).', u""K.I.T.T. is always seen driving into the semi-trailer of the Foundation's truck. The logo seen on its side is a knight chess piece."", u'K.I.T.T. is a 1982 Pontiac Firebird Trans Am.', u'Bollywood movie Patthar Ke Phool (1991) used the Knight Rider theme music in a few scenes. This was done without any authorization.', u""An original concept was for K.A.R.R. to be white, based on the opposing Knights' colors of chess. The idea was rejected and left black with an alternate color scanner, due to K.A.R.R. being the same type of car used for K.I.T.T., and would require time and cost-consuming paint jobs. It also did not feel right to the producers, that black was good and white was bad, in the colors of the two opposing vehicles."", u""K.I.T.T.'s voice modulator lights changed after the first season, from a flashing solid red light to the iconic cross style.
