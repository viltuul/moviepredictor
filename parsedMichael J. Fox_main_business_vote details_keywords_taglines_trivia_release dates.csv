Following them are Ken Jenkins (Bob Kelso) and Zach Braff (J.D.), who are absent from seven and eight episodes, respectively.', u'Many episodes contain some form of the phrase ""And there it is"" in its dialogue, usually when the moral or theme of that episode is revealed. Usually J.D. delivers this line, but sometimes other characters are given this responsibility.', u'In The Office: Company Picnic (2009), the fifth season finale of The Office (2005) , the ""hospital"", to which Pam is taken, is a brightly lit Sacred Heart.', u'Sarah Chalke was actually pregnant in season nine.', u'The only girls names Dr. Cox has used more than once are Lily, Ginger, Shirley, Gidget, Marcia, Gloria, Janice, Betsy, Carol, Toto, Nancy, and Brittany, which J.D. points out to Dr. Cox, who responds with ""Today, I\'m going with famous pop-stars.""', u'Through the first season, the cast and crew, especially Writer and Creator Bill Lawrence, were so sure that the series would be cancelled by the end of the season, that a plot twist was created for use when they\'d have a forced series finale. This plot twist noted the fact that The Janitor (Neil Flynn) never directly spoke, nor was spoken to by any other character than J.D. (Zach Braff). Therefore, The Janitor would be a complete figment of J.D.\'s imagination. This idea was kept up into the second season, still in fear of cancellation, until Flynn asked Lawrence to be able to finally interact with another cast member on the series. Although Elliot (Sarah Chalke) throws a cup at him in the sixth episode, and sarcastically says ""SORRY!"", in episode eleven, he gets punched on the balls by a little girl, and in episode fifteen, The Janitor teases the nurse with the vacuum cleaner.', u""It was Zach Braff's idea to have John Ritter play J.D.'s father."", u'At the beginning of the second season, a longer intro was introduced that included all of the characters in the show, and not just the doctors. It was quickly scuttled when NBC decided to extend the length of the episodes in an attempt to win more viewers.', u'Season eight was originally supposed to be the show\'s finale, but Creator Bill Lawrence decided to add a ninth season (and not doing a spin-off). As a result, the show changed significantly. Season nine became known under the title ""Scrubs: Med School"", J.D. was no longer the central character, a lot of new actors and actresses were cast, and the episode titles no longer started with ""My..."", but with ""Our..."". The whole show was eventually cancelled after season nine.', u'Ted (Sam Lloyd) has a picture of his mother in his office. The woman portrayed, is the real-life mother of Lloyd.', u'A list of the languages the characters know as revealed throughout the episodes. Elliot speaks German and French, Turk knows very little French, and he learns Spanish for Carla. Dr. Cox and Carla speak Spanish, and The Janitor knows sign language, and also speaks Spanish and Korean. J.D. also speaks a bit of Turkish, when a Turkish doctor tries to steal his pudding for the second time.', u'In one episode, J.D. daydreams about winning an award at a ceremony hosted by Dr. Cox. When he breaks out of his trance, he smirks and utters to himself ""Take that, Tony Shalhoub!"" This is a comic reference to the fact that Zach Braff lost his only Primetime Emmy nomination for this show to Shalhoub for his role in Monk (2002), as well as the fact that Shalhoub won a grand total of three Emmys for this role by the end of the show\'s run.', u'In the Spanish dubbed version of the show, Carla Espinosa (Judy Reyes) speaks with her mother in Italian. In the original English version, they speak Spanish.', u'Hooch (Phil Lewis) was portrayed as crazy, and sometimes homicidal. Lewis spent time in prison in 1993 for manslaughter.', u'This show was originally going to air on ABC, but then they turned it down, and NBC picked it up. In 2008, ABC picked it up after NBC cancelled it.', u""The third floor of the hospital, where this show was filmed, had been renovated to be offices for the crew and producers, and dressing rooms for the cast. The show's staff and cast were allowed to bring their dogs to work, and they all stay on the third floor. Donald Faison (Turk) was not a fan of the dogs, and was seemingly left quite a few presents by the dogs right in front of his door. Actually, fellow cast member, Robert Maschio (The Todd), collected the dog feces and placed them in front of Donald Faison's dressing room door. Maschio revealed this for the first time in a video for the DVD release of the show. It was put on the third season DVD special features. During Faison's interview, he was still unaware it was Maschio, and not the dogs leaving him the presents."", u'Sacred Heart Hospital is named after the school which Christa Miller, (wife of writer Bill Lawrence) attended.', u'Every episode with an outside shot has a van-styled ambulance in the background.', u'As of August 2011, the North Hollywood Medical Center, where the series was shot, was torn down.', u""Zach Braff and Judy Reyes announced they were leaving the show after season eight, so Bill Lawrence ended J.D.'s story in the season finale. However, neither Lawrence nor ABC wanted to finish the show, so season nine was known as Scrubs: Med School and featured a new group of characters. Donald Faison and John C. McGinley remained as regulars, and Braff, Sarah Chalke, and Ken Jenkins agreed to guest-star sporadically."", u'While Bill Lawrence stated on Facebook that The Janitor\'s real name was Glenn Matthews, this was in conflict with season three, episode eight, ""My Friend the Doctor"", where J.D. sees The Janitor playing the role of the Transit Cop in The Fugitive (1993). At the end of the episode, The Janitor admits that it was him playing that role. The role of the Transit Cop was played by an actor named ""Neil Flynn"", indicating that The Janitor\'s actual name also had to be Neil Flynn. However, it is possible that, like many actors and actresses, Glenn Matthews went by the stage name of ""Neil Flynn"".', u'Former cast members of Spin City (1996) often appeared as guest stars. Cast members have included Michael J. Fox, Heather Locklear, Barry Bostwick, Richard Kind, Alan Ruck, Alexander Chaplin, and Michael Boatman. Bill Lawrence was also the creator of Spin City (1996), and Producer Randall Winston was also an Associate Producer on Spin City (1996).', u""Dr. Cox's full name is Percival Ulysses Cox, but he went by Perry."", u'Dr. Perry Cox is named after a former High School English teacher Bill Lawrence had. It is simply a coincidence that the surnames of the only two major cast members from his previous show, Friends (1994), who had guest appearances on this show, are Matthew Perry and Courteney Cox.', u'The officiant at the wedding of Lady and The Janitor was Bill Lawrence. At the beginning of the ceremony, he says it\'s ""time to join you two in marriage as only the creator can.""', u'The teasers for the 2001 season finale parodied the teasers for 24 (2001), which had the same time slot as this show.', u""Michael Muhney was initially up for the role of J.D., but was told he wasn't quirky enough."", u'The set used for Sacred Heart Hospital was used in Crossroads (2002).', u'Includes several references to Friends (1994), including numerous references to Elliot and J.D. being like Rachel and Ross. Courtney Cox and Matthew Perry, who played Monica and Chandler on Friends (1994), also guest starred on this show.', u'The hospital setting of Sacred Heart was also used as the setting of the Adult Swim show, Childrens Hospital (2008), during the first three seasons.', u'Dr. Cox (John C. McGinley) has been seen wearing several professional sports jerseys, including Jeremy Shockey and Chris Chelios, two ""bad boys"" of their respective professions.', u'Most of the lead cast (and many of the recurring characters) were also supporting, lead, or guest voices on Clone High (2002). Both were Executively Produced by Bill Lawrence.', u'In season three, episode eight, ""My Friend the Doctor"", while J.D. is watching The Fugitive (1993), he sees The Janitor (Neil Flynn). Flynn played the part of the Transit Cop in the movie.', u'As an experiment, the season five finale, ""My Transition"", was finished and aired in High Definition. This was the first network show to complete an on-line edit in Final Cut Pro SD, and with this episode, became the first network show to online in High Definition in Final Cut Pro. However, the show continued to be produced in Standard Definition. According to Producer Randall Winston: ""After a lot of teasing, yes, the HD was an experiment, for everyone really. We will not be doing any more HD, there is a cost that no one is interested in covering, and there is debate, not amongst us here at the show, about how the quality stands up. I don\'t think that we can get the look that the show is designed around by using tape.""', u'Despite the fact that Dr. Cox is an outspoken atheist, he talks to God more than any other character in the show, albeit ironically.', u""J.D.'s social security number is 987-65-4320, and his P.I.N. is 3674 (D-O-R-I)."", u""Travis Schuldt (Keith) is older than Sarah Chalke (Elliot), even though Keith is meant to be Elliot's boy toy."", u'Zach Braff (J.D.) and Eliza Coupe (Denise ""Jo"" Mahoney) share the same birthday. Braff is six years older than Coupe.', u'Many songs by Joshua Radin appeared in the show. Joshua Radin is close friends with Zach Braff (Dr. John ""J.D."" Dorian.', u'In the German dubbed version, Elliot speaks Danish instead of German, and in later episodes sometimes Bavarian (a very curious dialect only spoken in the southeast of Germany).', u""Dr. Cox's son, Jack, was born on March 21, 2003."", u'In season nine, episode five, ""Our Mysteries"", the teacher evaluation results list is filled primarily with the names of Presidents, including Thomas Jefferson, Gerald Ford, and Dwight D. Eisenhower.', u'The show has some connections to the abbreviation ""TCW"". Donald Faison starred in Remember the Titans (2000), whose high school was ""TCW"". J.D. dated a girl, who was called ""TCW"" (Tasty Coma Wife), and then it is shown in season six, episode fourteen, ""My No Good Reason"", as being from a school with the initials ""TCW"".', u'In season one, episode nineteen, ""My Old Man"", while Eliot and Turk are giving their presentation, a doctor is shown wearing a name badge that reads, ""Dr. Hunter S. Thompson"". Hunter S. Thompson was an American author who wrote ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" and ""The Rum Diaries"".', u""Ken Jenkins' (Dr. Kelso's) wife, Katharine Hougton graduated from Sarah Lawrence College, which was founded by the great-great-grandparents of Bill Lawrence."", u'Due to budget cuts during season eight, the writing staff was split into two groups (one for episodes one through seven, the other for episodes eight through eighteen). Additionally, each regular cast member was absent for three episodes during the season (two in the case of Zach Braff and Sarah Chalke).', u'Whenever talking about surgery or operating, Turk almost always mentions the removal of the spleen.', u""In the opening sequence, Elliot's hair changes as she approaches the hospital bed. It starts down, and then can be seen up in a hair clip."", u'It was presumed to be revealed in the season eight finale, that The Janitor\'s real name is ""Glenn Matthews"". However, after J.D. walks away, someone walks by The Janitor, and calls him ""Tommy"".

Shawn Keller, Supervising Animator for Cookie, stated, ""It was kind of a sad fact that he knew that he was not going to be able to see this film before he passed away. He did a bang-up job doing the voice work, knowing the fact that he was never gonna see his last performance.', u'Michael Cedeno, Supervising Animator for King Nedakh, was astounded at Nimoy\'s voice talent, stating that he had ""so much rich character"" in his performance. As he spoke his lines, Cadeno said the crew would sit there and watch Leonard Nimoy in astonishment.', u""The film has very similar sound effects to the Star Wars saga, including the gun sounds and explosions. Plus the gas mask wearing henchmen make breathing sounds similar to Darth Vader's."", u'Kirk Wise said that they chose Michael J. Fox for the role, because they felt he gave his character his own personality and made him more believable on-screen. Fox said that voice acting was much easier than his experience with live-action, because he did not have to worry about what he looked like in front of a camera while delivering his lines. The directors mentioned that Fox was also offered a role for Titan A.E. (2000). He allowed his son to choose which film he would work on, and he chose this one.', u'The wave shown near the end of the movie, on the vase, into which The Mole digs, is a reference to a famous art work by Hokusai; ""The Great Wave off Kanagawa"".', u'At the tattoo parlor in the Atlantean city, there is a sign that says ""EAT FISH"".', u""Nathaniel Parker auditioned for the role of Lyle T.

Edmonds recalled, ""Don Novello would look at the sheet, and he would read the line that was written once, and he would never read it again, and we never used a written line, it was improvs, the whole movie."" Prior to this, Don Novello was known, primarily, for portraying Father Guido Sarducci on Saturday Night Live (1975), and in Casper (1995).', u'Rourke is named after an Ayn Rand character.', u'Sweet\'s Supervising Animator, Ron Husband, indicated that one of the challenges was animating Sweet in sync with Morris\' rapid line delivery, while keeping him believable.

He mentioned, ""When he was happy, he was really happy, and when he\'s solemn, he\'s real solemn.""', u'Kirk Wise chose James Garner because of his previous experience with action films, especially war and Western films, and said the role ""fits him like a glove"". When asked if he would be interested in the role, Garner replied ""I\'d do it in a heartbeat.""', u'Kida\'s Supervising Animator, Randy Haycock, stated that Cree Summer was very ""intimidating"" when he first met her.

This may be an homage to the R.M.S. Titanic, which sank in 1912 in the Atlantic two years before the events of this film.', u'Lloyd Bridges was originally cast and recorded as Whitmore, but he died before completing the film. Mahoney\'s zest and vigor led to Whitmore\'s personality being re-worked for the film. John Mahoney stated that doing voice work was ""freeing"", and allowed him to be ""big"" and ""outrageous"" with his character.', u'David Ogden Stiers portrayed Oberoth in a different Atlantis, Stargate: Atlantis (2004).', u""Sound references from the Jurassic Park franchise were used in the movie. Eddie Carr's scream from The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997) is used twice during Rourke's final moments, and the Gallimimus roar from Jurassic Park (1993) is used during the leviathan's pursuit on the escaping sub pods and Aqua-Evacs containing the expedition crew."", u'Most of the film takes place in 1914, the year World War I started.', u'The Uyless being attacked by the leviathan, is a similar scene to Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace (1999), where Qui-Gon Jinn, Obi-wan Kenobi, and Jar Jar Binks are also attacked by sea monsters en route to Naboo.', u""A running gag in the film is Milo constantly reading or studying the Shepherd's Journal. At one point, when the gang are having a rest stop and having a bite to eat, Audrey and Sweet even tell Milo that he has been reading the book for ages."", u'The final shot of the film (the restored Atlantis) was actually a combination of hundreds of drawings lined up into one fifteen-hundred-foot-long drawing. Each of the drawings had to be carefully drawn, with the planes flying across the entire pullout to convince the audience that it was one drawing.', u""When Whitmore is showing Milo the r\xe9sum\xe9s of the crew, with whom he'll be travelling to Atlantis, half of the picture on Commander Rourke's is covered up by another r\xe9sum\xe9. In the commentary on the DVD, the directors and the producer stated that this was in reference to the fact that Commander Rourke, the villain of the film who would go on to betray Milo, has a hidden side."", u'After most of the crew decides to stay behind with Milo, Rourke says, ""P.T. Barnum was right."" This most likely refers to the quote ""There\'s a sucker born every minute"", which is often credited to Barnum, but most likely originates from David Hannum, a critic of Barnum and his customers.', u""Milo's vehicle in the final fight scene is reminiscent of a sculpture found in archeological excavations of Egypt.

Among the cut scenes were: A scene in the beginning with Mr. Lee (originally, the burning cows trampled over Mr. Lee, killing him, as his family watches in horror); another where the Martians break into the White House (the White House decorator is decorating the Ronald Reagan Room, and the Martians break in through the window and vaporize him); an extended version of the Doughnut World scene (the female employee at the doughnut shop is trying to escape the building with Richie and some cops when the Martians attack. Richie gets out, turns around and sees the building burst into flames, and we see the skeletons of the other characters); the death scene of Dr. Zeigler; and the stealing of the translator device; an extended version of the casino break-in, including the death of Mr. Brian, who is trying to save his money and gets zapped, along with many other gamblers; an alternate ending, where Byron actually IS killed by the Martians and the Martians drag his body away. Planes fly by later, and kill those Martians with the Slim Whitman music. Later, during the award ceremony, Byron is remembered by Taffy in a long and sweet speech. Louise, Cedric and Neville are sitting in the audience of this ceremony, crying and wearing black.', u'The following scenes were cut from the film, but, for the most part, are in the novelization and early drafts of the script. It is unknown if any of them were actually filmed: Right after the Norris family is introduced, there is a short scene of General Decker playing golf with some fellow military brass. During that scene, he expresses disgust with President Dale\'s peaceful approach to the Martians. Nathalie\'s interview of Professor Kessler was slightly longer. Right after the press conference, where the reporter asks the two sexes question, there is a short scene of Byron in his apartment going through a scrapbook and looking at all of his victories, and the reason why he and Louise are divorced is revealed: Spousal abuse. A scene where Jason and Nathalie learn that they will both be going to cover the Martians\' landing. The clip of Nathalie dancing in the trailer was part of this scene. The Pahrump massacre was a little longer. A short scene right after the Pahrump massacre showing the aftermath: surviving reporters too stunned to speak to any surviving camera crews, surviving soldiers trying to assess the situation, and traumatized and wounded civilians searching for separated loved ones. The Oval Office scene right after the Pahrump massacre was longer and showed President Dale and the others watching Carl Sagan being interviewed by Larry King, and Sagan was insisting that the Martians\' attack was a cultural misunderstanding. It is highly unlikely Sagan and King would both have been available for cameo appearances (especially since Sagan\'s health was declining at the time), so it is probable that this was never filmed. The character of Cindy was given a slightly larger role and more lines. A short scene involving Byron taking a photo with three Asian businessmen, and Cindy bragging about how she gets big tips during national disasters, while images from the Pahrump massacre were playing on the televisions. A scene showing an anti-Martian protest in New York City on the morning of their Congressional address. President Dale\'s speech after the Congressional massacre was longer, and was supposed to have him announcing that diplomatic relations with the Martians will be completely suspended. Jerry\'s tour of the White House with the Martian Girl is slightly longer. Taffy wanders by and tells the Martian Girl to ""make sure that he wears a condom"". While heading for the President\'s bedroom, the Martian Girl was confronted by a Secret Service Agent. When he asks who she is and why she is there, she pulls out her ray-gun and disintegrates him. A short scene showing a Martian ""ritual"" before the invasion. The Martian Leader ignites a globe of Earth. The Martians\' attack on the White House was slightly longer. Right after Byron and Barbara discuss their plans to leave Las Vegas, there was a scene where Mr. Bava tells a group of panicking guests to remain calm, and that ""the Army has arrived and will have the situation under control very soon."" Right before Byron, Tom Jones, Barbara, Cindy, and the Rude Gambler leave the Luxor, there was a shot showing the Emergency Broadcast System on all of the casino\'s televisions. The Martians\' attack on Las Vegas was slightly longer. During that scene, the Martian holding the translating computer was supposed to be saying, ""HAVE A NICE DAY"" in addition to ""DON\'T RUN, WE ARE YOUR FRIENDS."" A short scene where Byron\'s group is going through the neon junkyard. Tom Jones refuses to try to risk flying Byron to Washington, D.C., fearing that the Martians\' attack on that city could be much worse than their attacking Las Vegas, but Byron will not take ""no"" for an answer. The group is then confronted by another Martian, and Tom Jones kills it. A short War Room scene, where General Decker tells President Dale that the Martians will destroy Earth in around six days if they maintain their assault. The Martians attacking the retirement home was slightly longer. The ""invasion"" montage after the nuclear attack scene was longer. It showed cities like New York City, Moscow, Tokyo, and Sydney being attacked, and landmarks such as the Great Pyramid, the Sphinx, the Empire State Building, the Statue of Liberty, the Sydney Opera House, and part of the Great Wall of China being destroyed. A short scene involved Richie and Grandma arriving at the radio station and telling some survivors barricaded inside what the record will do. Though skeptical, the survivors relent and allow them in. The ""Martians\' defeat"" montage was longer. Richie\'s speech at the end was longer.', u'The music used to kill the Martians is that of Country Western singer Slim Whitman.

Wilson ends up covered in manure.', u'There exists enough clues in all three movies to reconstruct the travels of the DeLorean precisely (to within a few minutes at worst, except 2015 Biff\'s arrival in 1955 and Doc\'s personal travels). There are a few interesting things to note: Not counting the time Doc travelled by himself, the DeLorean spent nearly seventy-one years (on its own time scale) from its first time travel to its destruction. By the time Marty made his ultimate return to 1985, he was approximately fourteen days, three hours, and twenty-seven minutes older than he should have been; Jennifer, on the other hand, is seven hours and twenty-six minutes younger than she should have been. Another interesting conclusion is a point of contention. There are two theories, one of which drops the last item. On November 12, 1955, between the time Biff arrived (or 6 a.m., whichever came later) and 6:38 p.m. (the time he left), there were four DeLoreans present in Hill Valley (ordered from its point of view): (1) The instance when Marty was trapped in 1955 in the original movie. (2) The instance when Biff came to 1955 to give himself the almanac. (3) The instance when Marty and Doc came back to 1955 to take the almanac back. (4) The instance when it was waiting in the abandoned mine. Those who do not agree with (4) argue that according to the ""ripple effect"" timeline as presented in the films, there wouldn\'t be a DeLorean hidden by Doc in the mine until later that evening, when the lightning blast would accidentally send Doc back to 1885, thereby altering the timeline. It is *entirely true* that *we* do not ever witness a moment in the films where all four instances coexist, but the text ""ordered from its point of view"" above should hint at a solution. Once the DeLorean is in 1885, consider what it would detect (if it were in a position to witness the comings and goings of its former selves): over seventy years of peace, then (1) arrives, then (2) and (3) arrive in some order; (2) then leaves at 6:38 p.m., (3) leaves around 10 p.m., and (1) leaves at 10:04 p.m. (4) itself leaves soon after that. If we grant that all three of those instances (1-3) continue to exist in the ""final"" timeline, then there should be no problem accepting this theory. Still not convinced? Consider the one hundred-year gap near the end of this movie, when Marty takes the DeLorean on its final journey. Seventy years into it, for a few hours, there are four instances of the car.', u'The scene where Marty and Jennifer kiss on the porch was the only scene shot while Back to the Future Part II (1989) was being made.', u""Each movie in the trilogy has an early scene that foreshadows an event that occurs in the third act. In the first movie, a figure of a guy clinging to a clock is seen in Doc's lab which foreshadows the climax of the movie in which Doc clings to a clock in a similar way. In the second movie, Doc says that he wishes the post office was as punctual as the weather and at the end a post office man gives a letter to Marty in 1955 at the precise time Doc is sent to 1885. In the third movie, when Doc is explaining to Marty at the Clayton Ravine how the train is going to push the DeLorean to eighty-eight miles per hour, he laments that nobody is going to be there to witness it. At the end, Doc remains with Clara, and thus witnesses the event."", u'In the deleted scene (shown on DVD), Buford ""Mad Dog"" Tannen was supposed to shoot Marshal Strickland in the back, killing him. His son was present at the time. This was edited out of the final cut, as it was deemed too depressing.

The Deputy\'s dialogue from the latter scene had to be re-dubbed to compensate for the change.', u'In Back to the Future Part II (1989), Biff watches A Fistful of Dollars (1964) in the alternative 1985, in which Clint Eastwood\'s character uses steel plating underneath his poncho.

The Screen Actors Guild subsequently introduced new rules about illicit use of actors."", u'In the DVD extras of Back to the Future Part II (1989), Robert Zemeckis had said that he really did not want the movie to take place in the future. That is because he felt that every time that a movie takes place in the future, it is mis-predicted.', u""Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale have admitted on the DVD commentary that they were originally not interested in doing a sequel to their success hit Back to the Future (1985), and that the open ending of the first movie was simply meant as a final joke. However, when plans for a sequel were made by the studio, they chose to remain involved in the continuation of their creation, and even extended it to two sequels. Zemeckis has claimed that if he knew that he was going to make a sequel, he would have made sure that Marty's girlfriend Jennifer wasn't in the car at the end of the first film. Since the movie would concentrate on Marty, there was not much for her to do, and she would even get in his way. This is why Jennifer is knocked out by Doc and left behind so early in the movie."", u'When 1985 Jennifer discovers herself in her 2015 house, her daughter Marlene (played by Michael J. Fox) appears at the top of the stairs, saying, ""Mom? Mom, is that you?"" This is the same exact line spoken by Marty (also played by Michael J. Fox) in each film of the trilogy when he is knocked out and wakes up in an unfamiliar place.', u'The ledge on the clock tower that Doc broke in Back to the Future (1985) is still broken in 2015.', u'At the school dance, a member of Biff\'s gang, 3-D, is shown ""spiking"" the punch with alcohol. In Back to the Future (1985) George is shown drinking the punch before confronting Biff in the parking lot. It may be that George\'s uncharacteristic courage in the original scene is attributable to drinking the spiked punch.', u'Just before Marty and Doc leave 2015, there is a shot of the time machine\'s control panel showing the ""Last Time Departed"" as Nov 12 1955 6:38 p.m. If they had noticed this, they would have known someone had used the time machine without them.', u'Carl Sagan considered this the greatest time travel movie ever made. He praised the accuracy in handling the multiple time lines as what would really happen if time travel were possible. In Back to the Future: The Game, Carl Sagan is the alias used by Doc Brown when visiting Hill Valley in 1931.', u""The principal actors and actresses had committed to the sequels before any scripts were written. However, there was a stumbling block in negotiations with Crispin Glover (George McFly in Back to the Future (1985)), who stated that he was offered a monetary amount less than half of what Lea Thompson and Thomas F. Wilson were being paid to return. Crispin believed this was due to Producer Bob Gale taking exception to Crispin voicing his disapproval of the original ending of the first film (where the McFlys viewed money and material possessions as rewards), causing a script change. During sequel negotiations, Crispin's agent expressed to producers that Crispin wanted fair compensation, in addition to a script approval clause in his contract. Bob Gale refused to give in to either of these requests, instead offering a lower salary amount than the first offer. After Crispin turned down the lowball offer of one hundred twenty-five, Gale re-wrote the sequel script to lessen George McFly's screentime. Jeffrey Weissman was cast as George and, using molds of Crispin made on the set of the first film, was dressed in facial prosthetics to look like Crispin, so that they could incorporate excerpts from the original movie. All shots of Weissman either show him from behind, at a distance, upside down or with sunglasses, in effect, fooling audiences into believing that Crispin had taken part in the sequel."", u""During filming of the cut sequence where the McFly family gathers around the table in 2015, between takes they had an earthquake, and were afraid the props may have moved around too much to edit the scene seamlessly as Michael J. Fox had played three characters in the same shot. To the film crew's surprise however, everything was exactly where it was supposed to be for the sequence."", u""Filmed at the same time as Back to the Future Part III (1990).

Fox has since stated that this was an early symptom of his Parkinson's Disease, although the medical diagnosis was not made until 1991."", u'Griff\'s ""Pit Bull"" Hoverboard was originally to be called ""Mad Dog"" to foreshadow his character in Back to the Future Part III (1990).', u'When ""Hill Valley"" was created for Back to the Future (1985), they built the town in the pristine 1955 condition, and shot the middle of the movie, then damaged it for the 1985 town, and shot the beginning and end of the movie. When they decided to shoot Back to the Future Part II (1989), they had to clean the set up and restore it to the same condition it was in 1955. It cost more to rebuild, than it cost to build it from scratch.', u'The biggest effect of the picture is a camera trick called ""vistaglide"". There are four scenes that use the effect of the same actor interacting with themselves. The four scenes that were shot were Griff and 2015 Biff in the Cafe \'80s, the dinner sequence in 2015, 1955 Biff talking to 2015 Biff in the garage, and 1955 Doc talking with 1985 Doc. In order to create the dinner sequence with the vistaglide, the camera had to be divided into thirds and Michael had to come in three different times to play his older self, Marty, Jr., and his daughter Marlene. This is the first film to accomplish interaction between the same actor on the screen twice as two different characters. If you watch closely, you\'ll see that 2015 Biff\'s hand disappears during the scene in the garage.', u'On October 21, 2015 multiple theaters screened the movie, as that is the exact date Doc, Marty, and Jennifer travel to the future.', u""To commemorate the release of a 30th anniversary Back to the Future Blu-ray box-set, a short movie called Back to the Future: Doc Brown Saves the World (2015) was filmed with Christopher Lloyd reprising his role of Doc Brown. In the movie, Doc tapes a video message, explaining that he travelled to the 2040s in a rebuilt DeLorean, and discovered that inventions such as the Hoverboard and hydrated food will cause people to become massively overweight; even worse, a simultaneous glitch in every nuclear Mr. Fusion device on the planet will cause a nuclear holocaust that decimates the world's population. He subsequently travels back in time, and successfully prevents such dangerous devices from ever being invented, thus explaining why the future 2015 as seen in this movie did not come true in reality."", u""The date on the 2015 USA Today newspaper is October 22nd.

In 1955, he wears the paper kind issued at 1950\'s style 3-D movies, but for his scenes in 1985, a pair of real sunglasses with red and blue lenses were made to better suit the era. By 2015, Griff\'s goons wear holographic-type shades.', u'In promotional material, such as Back to the Future Part II Behind-the-Scenes Special Presentation (1989) Director Robert Zemeckis explained that ""hoverboards float on magnetic energy"". He also added, ""they\'ve been around for years, it\'s just that parent groups haven\'t let toy manufacturers make them. But we got our hands on some and put them in the movie."" He was only joking, of course, but interestingly enough, Mattel (whose logo appeared on the hoverboard props) soon found themselves overwhelmed with callers asking where they could buy one. Although they looked pretty convincing in the movie, the hoverboards were simply wooden props attached to the actors and actresses feet. To make the boards fly, the actors were suspended by cables, which were then erased during post-production.', u'Elisabeth Shue was cast as Jennifer, and all the closing shots of Back to the Future (1985) were re-shot for the beginning of this film. Claudia Wells (Jennifer in Back to the Future (1985)) was unable to reprise her role, as she had stopped acting because her mother had been diagnosed with cancer. She returned to acting for the independent film Still Waters Burn (2008).', u'According to Michael J. Fox, he found out there was going to be a sequel to Back to the Future (1985) when he watched the VHS version and the words ""To be continued"" were added at the end. He immediately called his agent to make sure he was going to be in the sequel.', u'Robert Zemeckis considers this one of his favorite, and strangest films.', u'This movie was the most advanced film of its time for using ""every trick in the book"", according to Robert Zemeckis. It was in the late 1980s when the concept of CGI was starting. However, in the film, very few CGI effects were actually needed.', u""The soda menu at Cafe '80s listed four types of Pepsi products: Original, Diet, Max, and Perfect. Pepsi Max did became an actual flavor by 1993 in Europe. The American version was introduced in 2007."", u'Very few of the original costumes from the Enchantment Under the Sea Dance were actually used for production of the sequel. Lea Thompson was the only actress present wearing her dress from the original movie.', u'The tagline for Jaws 19 is ""This time it\'s really, REALLY personal"". On the marquee is the name of the Director, ""Max Spielberg"", Executive Producer Steven Spielberg\'s son. Max was born in June of 1985, the same year the first film in the franchise was released.

This was written so that Christopher Lloyd would not have to constantly wear old-age make-up for the two sequels, since he would primarily be portraying the 1985 incarnation of Doc.', u'Originally, only one sequel was planned. The script for this sequel, known as ""Paradox"" included all the elements of this movie and Back to the Future Part III (1990), but compressed to fit into one movie. However, it was revealed with the release of the DVD set, that there was an even earlier script which involved Marty meeting up with his parents while they\'re college students in the sixties. (This was probably dropped, because no matter how you cut it, George and Lorraine wouldn\'t have been in college during the ""Protest Era"", they were too old.)', u'Although Marty McFly comments that his son ""looks just like him"", there is one notable difference between the two (aside from a faulty jacket sleeve and a white t-shirt): Marty McFly, Jr. has brown eyes, whereas his father doesn\'t (this can be seen most clearly in the scene with Griff in Cafe \'80s).', u'In the hot tub scene, the film Biff and his lady friends are watching is A Fistful of Dollars (1964), starring Clint Eastwood. This ""foreshadows"" Marty\'s alias in Back to the Future Part III (1990).', u'When the future Marty McFly attempts to play his guitar, he plays part of the main riff of ""Power of Love"" by Huey Lewis and The News, the theme song for Back to the Future (1985).', u""On September 8, 2011, the Parkinson's Research Foundation announced that fifteen hundred pairs of the futuristic Nike MAG shoes, based on the sneakers worn by Michael J. Fox in this movie, would be auctioned off on eBay. The first pair sold to Tinie Tempah for the winning bid of thirty-seven thousand five hundred dollars."", u'Doc mentions that he left Einstein in a suspended animation kennel in 2015. This line was written to explain why Einstein was not with Doc when he came back to 1985 to pick up Marty and Jennifer, since in Back to the Future (1985), Einstein had gone with Doc into the future, but was not there when Doc came back at the end of that film and the beginning of this one.', u'In the original draft of the script, Marty does not see a marquee for ""Jaws 19"" when in 2015. Instead the theater lists ""Godzilla 2015"", almost coincidentally predicting the real-life Godzilla (2014).', u""When Marty arrives in 2015, he looks in the window of an antique store, where we see the denim jacket that he wore in 1985, a Roger Rabbit doll and a Jaws (1987) Nintendo game.

This time it\'s really, REALLY personal!""', u'The hoverboard sequences required many different special effects and camera tricks. In the shots where Michael J.

This date was made infamous by the assassination of respected Roman leader Gaio Giulio Cesare (Julius Caesar) in 44 B.C.', u""When the DeLorean is struck by lightning at the end, it travels back to January 1, 1885, at 12:00 a.m. (as shown by the malfunctioning time circuits before the jump). At the beginning of the movie, they travel to October 21, 2015, at 4:29 p.m. This means that the total time the DeLorean has passed through during the entire trilogy, counting all the on-screen jumps, is one hundred thirty years, nine months, twenty days, sixteen hours, and twenty-nine minutes. This, however, doesn't include the off-screen jumps Doc Brown made before he returned to 1985 to pick up Marty and Jennifer (he does mention those jumps to Marty, and even shows him a newspaper from a slightly more distant future)."", u""According to the revised six dollar USA Today newspaper article (which formerly featured Marty McFly, Jr. arrested for theft, and now featured Griff Tannen's gang arrested for destruction of the Hill Valley courthouse's window), the real names of Griff's 2015 gang, Data, Spike, and Whitey, are Rafe Unger, Leslie O'Malley, and Chester Nogura."", u'This is the only film in the trilogy that does not end with a time travel vehicle flying directly at the camera.', u'In early scripting, the DeLorean\'s malfunctioning time circuits were due to a police shoot-out\'s or Old Man Peabody\'s having damaged the car from gunfire. These scenes were later rejected, and so the time display\'s flickering was impliedly attributed to merely the amateur ""prototypical"" construction of the time machine (Doc had been the first one to successfully create time travel, after all, and so his initial invention, the somewhat cobbled-together sports-car rig, rather than the subsequently-constructed and more-professionally-designed steam-locomotive machine, would understandably be fairly primitive and experimental, and thus more prone to malfunctions), and to all the stress and battering about that it endured (especially during the periods with the inexperienced Marty, and the clumsy or infirm Biff at the controls) during its life up to that time.', u'The original draft of the script had Doc and Marty travelling to 1967 instead of back to 1955 to stop Biff. Marty once again encounters his mother, and accidentally prevents her from going on vacation with his father, thus stopping his own conception, and endangering his existence once more. Throughout the 1967 scenes, the 1985 Doc is continuously hiding from his 1967 counterpart, but the duo requires the younger version\'s help, since the ""Mr. Fusion"" is broken.', u""In 1985A, the newspaper bearing the story of Doc's mental hospital commitment has a story about Richard Nixon seeking a fifth presidential term. This is believed to have been inspired by the Alan Moore graphic novel Watchmen, in which Richard Nixon is serving a fifth term."", u'On his tombstone, George McFly (who was born on April 1, 1938), is revealed to have the middle name of ""Douglas"".', u'The principal actors committed to the sequels before any scripts were written. Crispin Glover did not return, and Bob Gale came up with the idea to have George be murdered, as a way of writing Crispin Glover out of the script.', u'Biff\'s grandmother, Gertrude, is the mother of Biff\'s father, Irving ""Kid"" Tannen, as seen in Back to the Future: The Game.', u""The Wild Gunman (1984) video game that Marty plays at the Caf\xe9'80s when he talks to the two boys, is a strong foreshadowing of Back of the Future Part III (1990), in which Marty travels back through time to 1885 to rescue Doc, who is trapped in that time period."", u'In this movie, Marty, Doc, and Jennifer travel to October 21, 2015. While there Marty sees a news story showing the Cubs winning the World Series in a sweep against Miami. In 2015, the Chicago Cubs did make their first playoff appearance since 2008 and made it to the NLCS (by defeating the Pittsburgh Pirates and St. Louis Cardinals). However, on October 21, 2015, the Cubs were swept by the New York Mets.']","[u'UK::November 1989 (London Film Festival)', u'USA::20 November 1989 (Century City, California)\n (premiere)', u'USA::22 November 1989', u'Canada::24 November 1989', u'UK::24 November 1989', u'Ireland::24 November 1989', u'Australia::7 December 1989', u'Japan::9 December 1989', u'Brazil::14 December 1989', u'Austria::15 December 1989', u'Belgium::20 December 1989', u'France::20 December 1989', u'Colombia::21 December 1989', u'West Germany::21 December 1989', u'Spain::22 December 1989', u'Finland::22 December 1989', u'Italy::22 December 1989', u'Netherlands::22 December 1989', u'Portugal::22 December 1989', u'Sweden::22 December 1989', u'Denmark::26 December 1989', u'Argentina::28 December 1989', u'South Korea::13 January 1990', u'Turkey::26 January 1990', u'Taiwan::27 January 1990', u'Uruguay::1 February 1990', u'Hong Kong::1 March 1990', u'Hungary::5 April 1990', u'Philippines::26 June 1990 (Davao)', u'Greece::17 December 2002 (DVD premiere)', u'Russia::26 October 2010 (Blu-ray premiere)', u'Japan::28 October 2012 (Harajuku Film Festival)', u'Japan::22 August 2015 (Kawasaki Shinyuri Film Festival)', u'Japan::19 September 2015 (Mito Short Film Festival)', u'Brazil::15 October 2015 (re-release)', u'Chile::21 October 2015 (re-release)', u'Spain::21 October 2015 (re-release) (subtitled version)', u'UK::21 October 2015 (re-release)', u'Mexico::21 October 2015 (re-release)', u'Sweden::21 October 2015 (re-release)', u'Japan::11 March 2016 (Chofu Film Festival)']",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

In a memo to Robert Zemeckis, he said that the title should be changed to ""Spaceman From Pluto"", tying in with the Marty-as-alien jokes in the film, and also suggested further changes like replacing the ""I\'m Darth Vader from planet Vulcan"" line with ""I am a spaceman from Pluto!"" Sheinberg was persuaded to change his mind by a response memo from Steven Spielberg, which thanked him for sending a wonderful ""joke memo"", and that everyone got a kick out of it.

Fox; Fox is 5\' 4\xbd"" while Lloyd is 6\' 1"". To compensate for the height difference, Director Robert Zemeckis used specific blocking, where the two often stood far apart at different camera depths. For close-ups, Lloyd would have to hunch over to appear in frame with Fox. The same approach was used in the sequels.', u'Biff\'s catchphrases ""make like a tree and get outta here"" and ""butthead"" were improvised by Thomas F. Wilson.', u'Michael J. Fox had always been the first choice for Marty, but he was unavailable due to scheduling conflicts with his work on Family Ties (1982). As ""Family Ties"" co-star Meredith Baxter was pregnant at the time, Fox was carrying a lot more of the show than usual. The show\'s producer Gary David Goldberg simply couldn\'t afford to let Fox go. Zemeckis and Gale then cast Eric Stoltz as Marty based on his performance in Mask (1985). After six weeks of filming Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale felt that Stoltz wasn\'t right for the part, and Stoltz agreed. By this stage, Baxter was back fully on the show and Goldberg agreed to let Fox go off to make the film. Fox worked out a schedule to fulfill his commitment to both projects. Every day during production, he drove straight to the movie set after taping of the show was finished every day and averaged about five hours of sleep. The bulk of the production was filmed from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m., with the daylight scenes filmed on weekends. Reshooting Stoltz\'s scenes added three million dollars to the budget.', u'Thomas F. Wilson almost had his collarbone broken in the scene where Marty and Biff are about to fight in the cafeteria, as Eric Stoltz roughed up Tom for real, take after take, despite repeated requests from Tom to tone down the aggression.

Gale also said that if he had the chance to go back in time, he would really go back and see if they would have been friends."", u'At the London Comic Con 2015, Michael J. Fox admitted that his four children (one son and three daughters in their teens and twenties) never saw this movie.', u'Was the top grossing release of 1985.', u'A persistent myth is that Michael J. Fox had to learn to skateboard for the film. In fact, he was a reasonably skilled skateboarder, having ridden throughout high school. However, Per Welinder acted as a skateboarding double for the complex scenes. He also choreographed and coordinated the skateboarding action together with Robert Schmelzer.', u'While filming the ""parking"" scene with Marty and young Lorraine in the car, the production crew decided to play a practical joke at Michael J. Fox\'s expense. The scene called for Fox to drink from a prop liquor bottle filled with water and do a spit take when he sees Lorraine with a cigarette. For a specific take however, the prop liquor bottle was switched for one which contained real alcohol inside. Fox, unaware of this, performed the scene and drank from the bottle, only to discover the switch after-the-fact. The full gag is featured on the ""Outtakes"" section of the DVD.', u'According to Bob Gale, Johnny Depp auditioned for the role of Marty McFly: ""I looked through the notes, and I said, \'Geez, I don\'t even remember that we read Johnny Depp!\' So whatever he did, it wasn\'t all that memorable, I guess!""', u'From the day the film wrapped to the day it was released was a mere nine and a half weeks, an unprecedentedly short lead time for a major movie release.', u'According to an interview he did on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson (1962), Crispin Glover lost his voice, due to nervousness, while filming this movie.

However, the two Bobs were not thrilled with the first song Huey brought back to them. After explaining what they were hoping for, Huey came back with ""The Power of Love"". He was then told they needed one more song, and so, upon viewing a cut of the film, Huey got the inspiration for ""Back in Time"".', u'Producer Neil Canton offered the role of Doc Brown to Christopher Lloyd after having worked together on The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension (1984). Lloyd originally turned it down, but changed his mind after his wife convinced him to take the role. He improvised some of his lines.', u'The DeLorean was deliberately selected for its general appearance and gull wing doors, in order to make it plausible that people in 1955 would presume it to be an alien spacecraft.', u'Doc Brown refers to ""jigawatts"" of electricity. This is the now-obscure but once-standard pronunciation of the word ""gigawatt"", one billion watts. Nowadays it is usually pronounced with a hard ""g"" as in ""gander"" and ""gold"".

Wilson is asked about this movie by enthusiastic fans, he will often hand them a postcard of frequently asked questions as a timesaver.', u""A marketer hoped to get a prominent placement for California Raisins somewhere in the film. He suggested putting a bowl of raisins on a table at the Enchantment Under the Sea Dance. He had also told the California Raisins board that this would do for raisins what E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982) did for Reese's Pieces. Bob Gale informed him that a bowl of raisins would photograph like a bowl of dirt. The only thing that appears in the film is Marty jumping over Red, sleeping on a bench that is advertising California Raisins. Unhappy with their product placement, the California Raisins representatives complained to the producers, and had their five thousand dollars refunded."", u'Another deleted scene shows Marty peeking in on a class in 1955 and seeing his mother cheating on a test.', u""In the opening sequence, all of Doc's clocks read 7:53 (twenty-five minutes slow, as said by Doc on the phone) except for some broken clocks on the floor.

It is Marty who says it first, to his father after the dance. Later, an even older George McFly uses the line.', u'It took three hours in make-up to turn the twenty-three-year-old Lea Thompson into the forty-seven-year-old Lorraine.', u""The Screen Actors Guild can't have two people with the same name on their books. So Michael J. Fox inserted the letter J in his name to differentiate himself from an actor called Michael Fox. In Back to the Future (1985), Marty goes back to the year 1955. His dad is a huge fan of the show Science Fiction Theatre, something Marty uses to his advantage. The original Michael Fox starred in the real Science Fiction Theatre in the year 1955."", u'When Doc Brown first sends Einstein ""one minute"" into the future, the time elapsed between when the DeLorean disappears and reappears is actually one minute and twenty-one seconds, just as the reappearance occurred at 1:21 a.m., and the flux capacitor required 1.21 gigawatts of electricity.', u'Michael J. Fox was allowed by the producer of Family Ties (1982) to film this movie on the condition that he kept his full schedule on the television show, meaning no write-outs or missing episodes, and filmed most of the movie at night. He was not allowed to go on Back to the Future (1985) promotional tours.', u""Michael J. Fox has said that Marty's being characterized as riding skateboards, chasing girls, and interests in playing music, with hopes of becoming a rock star, was the exact same way he was during his own high school days."", u'When Robert Zemeckis was trying to sell the idea of this film, one of the companies he approached was Disney, who turned it down because they thought that the premise of a mother falling in love with her son (albeit by a twist of time travel) was too risqu\xe9 for a film under their banner. In fact, Disney was the only company to consider the film too risqu\xe9. All other companies said that the film was not risqu\xe9 enough, compared to other teen comedies at the time (for example, Fast Times at Ridgemont High (1982), Revenge of the Nerds (1984), et cetera).', u'The script never called for Marty to repeatedly bang his head on the gull-wing door of the DeLorean; this was improvised during filming as the door mechanism became faulty.', u'The test audience, to whom the movie was initially screened, was not told that the movie was intended to be a comedy. Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale recalled that the atmosphere in the cinema started to get really tense during the scene where Einstein the dog is sent through time, because the audience was expecting that something gruesome had happened to the dog.', u'Sid Sheinberg, the head of Universal Pictures, requested many changes to be made throughout the movie. Most of these he got, such as having ""Professor Brown"" changed to ""Doc Brown"" and his chimp Shemp changed to a dog named Einstein. Marty\'s mother\'s name had previously been Meg and then Eileen, but Sheinberg insisted that she be named Lorraine after his wife Lorraine Gary.', u'The film was banned in China mainland for a while because the notion of time travel ""disrespects history"". The ban has been lifted by now.', u'During Doc\'s demo of the time machine, just before he is about to leave for the future, he tells Marty ""I\'ll get to see who wins the next twenty-five World Series."" At the time the scene was written and shot, no one was thinking there would be a sequel, let alone one where the hook Back to the Future Part II (1989) would be Marty wanting to get a hold of a ""sports almanac"" so he could bet on games.', u""Near the beginning of the movie, Biff apparently got into an accident while driving George's car. George wants Biff's insurance to pay for the damage, but Biff refuses, and tells George his insurance should pay for it because there was a blind spot. Technically, Biff is right in this argument, though his reasons are incorrect. George's insurance will pay for the damage because coverage follows the car, not the driver."", u'The 1985 version of Doc\'s home is the garage that Marty and Doc hide the DeLorean in, in 1955. In the opening scene, an article shows that the mansion burned down years before, either for insurance money or due to an explosive experiment. The presence of the commercial development also implies that Doc sold the land surrounding the house for more money to fund his project. After all, he does state later that it took ""many years and his entire family fortune"" to build the time machine.', u'The production ultimately used three real DeLoreans.', u""Although Eric Stoltz's scenes were all re-shot with Michael J. Fox, one image of Stoltz remains. During one scene in the 1950s diner, there is a close-up of Biff's face as Marty launches a punch at him, and this was not re-shot, so that as well as Stoltz's hand and arm, his head is also visible to the left of the screen for a few frames."", u'On November 5, 2010, a large number of fans gathered at the Puente Hills Mall to kick off a week long series of events to celebrate the 25th anniversary of this movie. It was here that the city mayor declared October 21, 2010 officially Back To The Future Day for the city.', u'When Claudia Wells temporarily dropped out due to scheduling conflicts involving the short lived television series Off the Rack (1984), Melora Hardin was briefly cast as Jennifer opposite Eric Stoltz , but had to be replaced after Stoltz was dismissed, and it was discovered she was taller than Michael J. Fox. Hardin was dismissed before she had a chance to shoot a single scene, having only posed for a picture with Stoltz on the set, which was to be developed into the snapshot Marty carries with him.', u""A Texaco gas station is shown in both 1955 and 1985. Interestingly, Christopher Lloyd's maternal grandfather was one of the founders of the Texaco oil company."", u'According to Michael J. Fox on the 2010 DVD and Blu-ray interviews, the interior of the DeLorean was so tight due to the added props, that every time he had to shift gears, he would repeatedly hit his forearm on the handle that turns on the time circuits and he would also rap his knuckles hard against the time display board. If you pay attention during the car chase with the terrorists, you can hear these hits every time Marty uses the shifter.', u'The University of Southern California Film school\'s writing classes use the screenplay for Back to the Future as the model of ""The Perfect Screenplay"".', u'When Marty pretends to be Darth Vader from the planet Vulcan, he plays a tape labelled ""Edward Van Halen"" to scare George out of his sleep. It is an untitled Edward Van Halen original, written for The Wild Life (1984), which featured Lea Thompson, and starred Eric Stoltz.', u'Michael J. Fox is only ten days younger than Lea Thompson who plays his mother, and is almost three years older than his on-screen father Crispin Glover.', u""According to Bob Gale, in one of the early drafts of the script, Marty's original last name was McDermott, but it was thought to have too many syllables. It was Robert Zemeckis who then came up with naming him McFly."", u'Billy Zane makes his first on-screen appearance in this film as ""Match"", one of Biff\'s cronies.', u""Eric Stoltz insisted that the cast and crew address him as Marty, even when cameras weren't rolling. He would also wear Marty's wardrobe while travelling to and from the set each day. According to Tom Wilson, the only time that method-acting Stoltz would break character was when Eric would actively flirt with Lea Thompson in between takes."", u""The gas-powered struts that hold the De Lorean's gullwing doors open would fail during the course of filming a take, so crew members had to be on stand-by with hairdryers to warm them up to stop the doors from drooping."", u'When Doc emerged from the DeLorean in a radiation suit, Marty asked him, ""Is that a Devo suit?"" Devo was an American post-punk musical group, whose mainstream success was mainly in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The radiation suit Doc was wearing was similar to the ones Devo was known for wearing in music videos and live performances.', u'In the French translation of the movie, Marty McFly is called ""Pierre Cardin"" in 1955, instead of ""Calvin Klein"". In the Spanish translation, Marty is called ""Levi Strauss"" in 1955.', u'Christopher Lloyd based his performance as Doc Brown on a combination of Physicist Albert Einstein and Conductor Leopold Stokowski. Brown\'s pronunciation of gigawatts as ""jigawatts"", is based on the way a physicist, with whom Zemeckis and Gale met for research, said the word.', u""In the first scene at the diner, Marty asks for a Pepsi Free. This refers to a brand of Pepsi that was the company's first caffeine free cola. Ironically, in the same scene, Marty asks for a Tab, which was actually a diet cola brand produced by Pepsi's rival Coca-Cola. Regardless, both orders confused the man behind the counter."", u'When Marty first arrives in 1955, he crashes into the farm of Old Man Peabody, who has a son named Sherman. This was in tribute to a segment in the Rocky and His Friends (1959) television series, ""Peabody\'s Improbable History"", featuring the intelligent talking dog Mr. Peabody and his boy Sherman, who travel to different times in history using the W.A.B.A.C. Machine, and serve as a major inspiration for Doc Brown, Marty McFly, and the DeLorean time machine. In turn, the feature film Mr. Peabody & Sherman (2014), based on the ""Peabody\'s Improbable History"" segment, pays tribute to this movie with not only its overall style, but a clever reference in a scene where Peabody and Sherman travel at unbelievably high speeds in the W.A.B.A.C., travelling at eighty-eight miles per hour (and higher), much like the DeLorean.', u""The space alien gag first appeared in the screenplay's third draft, with the primary difference being that it was to be done to Biff."", u""The set for Kingston Falls in Gremlins (1984) is the same one used for this movie.

The first one happened shortly after the finishing of Back to the Future Part II (1989) and Back to the Future Part III (1990) (filming was done simultaneously) where all the original surrounding buildings burned to the ground by lightning. The second fire in 1994 almost destroyed the structure. In 2008, the fire that destroyed the nearby King Kong (1933) ride/set, along with two archive vaults and the New York street, slightly scorched the tower.', u'During his time on the film, and being a method actor, Eric Stoltz refused to answer to any other name, but that of his character, Marty Mcfly.

In the first draft of the screenplay the time machine was a laser device that was housed in a room. At the end of the first draft the device was attached to a refrigerator and taken to an atomic bomb test. Robert Zemeckis said in an interview that the idea was scrapped because he and Steven Spielberg did not want children to start climbing into refrigerators and getting trapped inside. (See also Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008).) The Nevada desert bomb test was left out in order to reduce the budget.

A few seconds later, when the Delorean is racing toward the clock tower, the speedometer shown is different, and has a top speed of ninety-five miles per hour. This allows the movie Delorean to reach eighty-eight miles per hour, as judged by that speedometer, although that speedometer shown does not exist on a real Delorean. The original Delorean vehicle can reach eighty-eight miles per hour, but the speedometer tops out at eighty miles per hour, and the needle would be pegged at the limit of the speedometer giving no ability to judge the speed. This is because of a 1979 traffic safety law that insured all speedometers in cars released after September of that year to top out at eighty-five miles per hour, in an effort to encourage drivers to travel at ""safer"" speeds. The law was overturned less than two years later, but by that time, Delorean had gone out of business.', u""The film was initially rejected by every other major studio. Most studios rejected the film because it wasn't raunchy enough, as the most successful teenage comedies at the time were of such nature. Disney rejected the film, as they felt the angle of a mother falling in love with her son was inappropriate for their films. In addition, studios were wary of Robert Zemeckis's work, as the films he had previously directed were largely flops.

The time is provided by the Mayor in 1885 in Back to the Future Part III, who starts it. The lightning strikes the clock tower at 10:04 p.m. on November 12, 1955.

Ingels is best known for his work of ""The Old Witch"" from The Haunt of Fear, the sister title of Tales From the Crypt published by EC. After horror comics were vilified and ceased to be published in the mid 1950s, Ingels relocated to Florida, and became a recluse.
